FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING



FOREWORD

THIS TALE GREW IN THE TELLING UNTIL IT BECAME A HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR OF THE RING AND INCLUDED MANY GLIMPSES OF THE YET MORE ANCIENT HISTORY THAT PRECEDED IT IT WAS BEGUN SOON AFTER THE HOBBIT WAS WRITTEN AND BEFORE ITS PUBLICATION IN 1937 BUT I DID NOT GO ON WITH THIS SEQUEL FOR I WISHED FIRST TO COMPLETE AND SET IN ORDER THE MYTHOLOGY AND LEGENDS OF THE ELDER DAYS WHICH HAD THEN BEEN TAKING SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS I DESIRED TO DO THIS FOR MY OWN SATISFACTION AND I HAD LITTLE HOPE THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS WORK ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS PRIMARILY LINGUISTIC IN INSPIRATION AND WAS BEGUN IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY BACKGROUND OF HISTORY FOR ELVISH TONGUES
WHEN THOSE WHOSE ADVICE AND OPINION I SOUGHT CORRECTED LITTLE HOPE TO NO HOPE I WENT BACK TO THE SEQUEL ENCOURAGED BY REQUESTS FROM READERS FOR MORE INFORMATION CONCERNING HOBBITS AND THEIR ADVENTURES BUT THE STORY WAS DRAWN IRRESISTIBLY TOWARDS THE OLDER WORLD AND BECAME AN ACCOUNT AS IT WERE OF ITS END AND PASSING AWAY BEFORE ITS BEGINNING AND MIDDLE HAD BEEN TOLD THE PROCESS HAD BEGUN IN THE WRITING OF THE HOBBIT IN WHICH THERE WERE ALREADY SOME REFERENCES TO THE OLDER MATTER ELROND GONDOLIN THE HIGHELVES AND THE ORCS AS WELL AS GLIMPSES THAT HAD ARISEN UNBIDDEN OF THINGS HIGHER OR DEEPER OR DARKER THAN ITS SURFACE DURIN MORIA GANDALF THE NECROMANCER THE RING THE DISCOVERY OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE GLIMPSES AND OF THEIR RELATION TO THE ANCIENT HISTORIES REVEALED THE THIRD AGE AND ITS CULMINATION IN THE WAR OF THE RING
THOSE WHO HAD ASKED FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOBBITS EVENTUALLY GOT IT BUT THEY HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS WENT ON AT INTERVALS DURING THE YEARS 1936 TO 1949 A PERIOD IN WHICH I HAD MANY DUTIES THAT I DID NOT NEGLECT AND MANY OTHER INTERESTS AS A LEARNER AND TEACHER THAT OFTEN ABSORBED ME THE DELAY WAS OF COURSE ALSO INCREASED BY THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN 1939 BY THE END OF WHICH YEAR THE TALE HAD NOT YET REACHED THE END OF BOOK ONE IN SPITE OF THE DARKNESS OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I FOUND THAT THE STORY COULD NOT NOW BE WHOLLY ABANDONED AND I PLODDED ON MOSTLY BY NIGHT TILL I STOOD BY BALINS TOMB IN MORIA THERE I HALTED FOR A LONG WHILE IT WAS ALMOST A YEAR LATER WHEN I WENT ON AND SO CAME TO LOTHLORIEN AND THE GREAT RIVER LATE IN 1941 IN THE NEXT YEAR I WROTE THE FIRST DRAFTS OF THE MATTER THAT NOW STANDS AS BOOK THREE AND THE BEGINNINGS OF CHAPTERS I AND III OF BOOK FIVE AND THERE AS THE BEACONS FLARED IN ANORIEN AND THEODEN CAME TO HARROWDALE I STOPPED FORESIGHT HAD FAILED AND THERE WAS NO TIME FOR THOUGHT
IT WAS DURING 1944 THAT LEAVING THE LOOSE ENDS AND PERPLEXITIES OF A WAR WHICH IT WAS MY TASK TO CONDUCT OR AT LEAST TO REPORT I FORCED MYSELF TO TACKLE THE JOURNEY OF FRODO TO MORDOR THESE CHAPTERS EVENTUALLY TO BECOME BOOK FOUR WERE WRITTEN AND SENT OUT AS A SERIAL TO MY SON CHRISTOPHER THEN IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH THE RAF NONETHELESS IT TOOK ANOTHER FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE TALE WAS BROUGHT TO ITS PRESENT END IN THAT TIME I CHANGED MY HOUSE MY CHAIR AND MY COLLEGE AND THE DAYS THOUGH LESS DARK WERE NO LESS LABORIOUS THEN WHEN THE END HAD AT LAST BEEN REACHED THE WHOLE STORY HAD TO BE REVISED AND INDEED LARGELY REWRITTEN BACKWARDS AND IT HAD TO BE TYPED AND RETYPED BY ME THE COST OF PROFESSIONAL TYPING BY THE TENFINGERED WAS BEYOND MY MEANS
THE LORD OF THE RINGS HAS BEEN READ BY MANY PEOPLE SINCE IT FINALLY APPEARED IN PRINT AND I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING HERE WITH REFERENCE TO THE MANY OPINIONS OR GUESSES THAT I HAVE RECEIVED OR HAVE READ CONCERNING THE MOTIVES AND MEANING OF THE TALE THE PRIME MOTIVE WAS THE DESIRE OF A TALETELLER TO TRY HIS HAND AT A REALLY LONG STORY THAT WOULD HOLD THE ATTENTION OF READERS AMUSE THEM DELIGHT THEM AND AT TIMES MAYBE EXCITE THEM OR DEEPLY MOVE THEM AS A GUIDE I HAD ONLY MY OWN FEELINGS FOR WHAT IS APPEALING OR MOVING AND FOR MANY THE GUIDE WAS INEVITABLY OFTEN AT FAULT SOME WHO HAVE READ THE BOOK OR AT ANY RATE HAVE REVIEWED IT HAVE FOUND IT BORING ABSURD OR CONTEMPTIBLE AND I HAVE NO CAUSE TO COMPLAIN SINCE I HAVE SIMILAR OPINIONS OF THEIR WORKS OR OF THE KINDS OF WRITING THAT THEY EVIDENTLY PREFER BUT EVEN FROM THE POINTS OF VIEW OF MANY WHO HAVE ENJOYED MY STORY THERE IS MUCH THAT FAILS TO PLEASE IT IS PERHAPS NOT POSSIBLE IN A LONG TALE TO PLEASE EVERYBODY AT ALL POINTS NOR TO DISPLEASE EVERYBODY AT THE SAME POINTS FOR I FIND FROM THE LETTERS THAT I HAVE RECEIVED THAT THE PASSAGES OR CHAPTERS THAT ARE TO SOME A BLEMISH ARE ALL BY OTHERS SPECIALLY APPROVED THE MOST CRITICAL READER OF ALL MYSELF NOW FINDS MANY DEFECTS MINOR AND MAJOR BUT BEING FORTUNATELY UNDER NO OBLIGATION EITHER TO REVIEW THE BOOK OR TO WRITE IT AGAIN HE WILL PASS OVER THESE IN SILENCE EXCEPT ONE THAT HAS BEEN NOTED BY OTHERS THE BOOK IS TOO SHORT
AS FOR ANY INNER MEANING OR MESSAGE IT HAS IN THE INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR NONE IT IS NEITHER ALLEGORICAL NOR TOPICAL AS THE STORY GREW IT PUT DOWN ROOTS INTO THE PAST AND THREW OUT UNEXPECTED BRANCHES BUT ITS MAIN THEME WAS SETTLED FROM THE OUTSET BY THE INEVITABLE CHOICE OF THE RING AS THE LINK BETWEEN IT AND THE HOBBIT THE CRUCIAL CHAPTER THE SHADOW OF THE PAST IS ONE OF THE OLDEST PARTS OF THE TALE IT WAS WRITTEN LONG BEFORE THE FORESHADOW OF 1939 HAD YET BECOME A THREAT OF INEVITABLE DISASTER AND FROM THAT POINT THE STORY WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED ALONG ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LINES IF THAT DISASTER HAD BEEN AVERTED ITS SOURCES ARE THINGS LONG BEFORE IN MIND OR IN SOME CASES ALREADY WRITTEN AND LITTLE OR NOTHING IN IT WAS MODIFIED BY THE WAR THAT BEGAN IN 1939 OR ITS SEQUELS
THE REAL WAR DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE LEGENDARY WAR IN ITS PROCESS OR ITS CONCLUSION IF IT HAD INSPIRED OR DIRECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEGEND THEN CERTAINLY THE RING WOULD HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND USED AGAINST SAURON HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANNIHILATED BUT ENSLAVED AND BARADDUR WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BUT OCCUPIED SARUMAN FAILING TO GET POSSESSION OF THE RING WOULDIN THE CONFUSION AND TREACHERIES OF THE TIME HAVE FOUND IN MORDOR THE MISSING LINKS IN HIS OWN RESEARCHES INTO RINGLORE AND BEFORE LONG HE WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT RING OF HIS OWN WITH WHICH TO CHALLENGE THE SELFSTYLED RULER OF MIDDLEEARTH IN THAT CONFLICT BOTH SIDES WOULD HAVE HELD HOBBITS IN HATRED AND CONTEMPT THEY WOULD NOT LONG HAVE SURVIVED EVEN AS SLAVES
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE DEVISED ACCORDING TO THE TASTES OR VIEWS OF THOSE WHO LIKE ALLEGORY OR TOPICAL REFERENCE BUT I CORDIALLY DISLIKE ALLEGORY IN ALL ITS MANIFESTATIONS AND ALWAYS HAVE DONE SO SINCE I GREW OLD AND WARY ENOUGH TO DETECT ITS PRESENCE I MUCH PREFER HISTORY TRUE OR FEIGNED WITH ITS VARIED APPLICABILITY TO THE THOUGHT AND EXPERIENCE OF READERS I THINK THAT MANY CONFUSE APPLICABILITY WITH ALLEGORY BUT THE ONE RESIDES IN THE FREEDOM OF THE READER AND THE OTHER IN THE PURPOSED DOMINATION OF THE AUTHOR
AN AUTHOR CANNOT OF COURSE REMAIN WHOLLY UNAFFECTED BY HIS EXPERIENCE BUT THE WAYS IN WHICH A STORYGERM USES THE SOIL OF EXPERIENCE ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE THE PROCESS ARE AT BEST GUESSES FROM EVIDENCE THAT IS INADEQUATE AND AMBIGUOUS IT IS ALSO FALSE THOUGH NATURALLY ATTRACTIVE WHEN THE LIVES OF AN AUTHOR AND CRITIC HAVE OVERLAPPED TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MOVEMENTS OF THOUGHT OR THE EVENTS OF TIMES COMMON TO BOTH WERE NECESSARILY THE MOST POWERFUL INFLUENCES ONE HAS INDEED PERSONALLY TO COME UNDER THE SHADOW OF WAR TO FEEL FULLY ITS OPPRESSION BUT AS THE YEARS GO BY IT SEEMS NOW OFTEN FORGOTTEN THAT TO BE CAUGHT IN YOUTH BY 1914 WAS NO LESS HIDEOUS AN EXPERIENCE THAN TO BE INVOLVED IN 1939 AND THE FOLLOWING YEARS BY 1918 ALL BUT ONE OF MY CLOSE FRIENDS WERE DEAD OR TO TAKE A LESS GRIEVOUS MATTER IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED BY SOME THAT THE SCOURING OF THE SHIRE REFLECTS THE SITUATION IN ENGLAND AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS FINISHING MY TALE IT DOES NOT IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE PLOT FORESEEN FROM THE OUTSET THOUGH IN THE EVENT MODIFIED BY THE CHARACTER OF SARUMAN AS DEVELOPED IN THE STORY WITHOUT NEED I SAY ANY ALLEGORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OR CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL REFERENCE WHATSOEVER IT HAS INDEED SOME BASIS IN EXPERIENCE THOUGH SLENDER FOR THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND MUCH FURTHER BACK THE COUNTRY IN WHICH I LIVED IN CHILDHOOD WAS BEING SHABBILY DESTROYED BEFORE I WAS TEN IN DAYS WHEN MOTORCARS WERE RARE OBJECTS I HAD NEVER SEEN ONE AND MEN WERE STILL BUILDING SUBURBAN RAILWAYS RECENTLY I SAW IN A PAPER A PICTURE OF THE LAST DECREPITUDE OF THE ONCE THRIVING CORNMILL BESIDE ITS POOL THAT LONG AGO SEEMED TO ME SO IMPORTANT I NEVER LIKED THE LOOKS OF THE YOUNG MILLER BUT HIS FATHER THE OLD MILLER HAD A BLACK BEARD AND HE WAS NOT NAMED SANDYMAN
THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS NOW ISSUED IN A NEW EDITION AND THE OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN TAKEN OF REVISING IT A NUMBER OF ERRORS AND INCONSISTENCIES THAT STILL REMAINED IN THE TEXT HAVE BEEN CORRECTED AND AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON A FEW POINTS WHICH ATTENTIVE READERS HAVE RAISED I HAVE CONSIDERED ALL THEIR COMMENTS AND ENQUIRIES AND IF SOME SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER THAT MAY BE BECAUSE I HAVE FAILED TO KEEP MY NOTES IN ORDER BUT MANY ENQUIRIES COULD ONLY BE ANSWERED BY ADDITIONAL APPENDICES OR INDEED BY THE PRODUCTION OF AN ACCESSORY VOLUME CONTAINING MUCH OF THE MATERIAL THAT I DID NOT INCLUDE IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION IN PARTICULAR MORE DETAILED LINGUISTIC INFORMATION IN THE MEANTIME THIS EDITION OFFERS THIS FOREWORD AN ADDITION TO THE PROLOGUE SOME NOTES AND AN INDEX OF THE NAMES OF PERSONS AND PLACES THIS INDEX IS IN INTENTION COMPLETE IN ITEMS BUT NOT IN REFERENCES SINCE FOR THE PRESENT PURPOSE IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY TO REDUCE ITS BULK A COMPLETE INDEX MAKING FULL USE OF THE MATERIAL PREPARED FOR ME BY MRS N SMITH BELONGS RATHER TO THE ACCESSORY VOLUME

1 CONCERNING HOBBITS

THIS BOOK IS LARGELY CONCERNED WITH HOBBITS AND FROM ITS PAGES A READER MAY DISCOVER MUCH OF THEIR CHARACTER AND A LITTLE OF THEIR HISTORY FURTHER INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE FOUND IN THE SELECTION FROM THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED UNDER THE TITLE OF THE HOBBIT THAT STORY WAS DERIVED FROM THE EARLIER CHAPTERS OF THE RED BOOK COMPOSED BY BILBO HIMSELF THE FIRST HOBBIT TO BECOME FAMOUS IN THE WORLD AT LARGE AND CALLED BY HIM THERE AND BACK AGAIN SINCE THEY TOLD OF HIS JOURNEY INTO THE EAST AND HIS RETURN AN ADVENTURE WHICH LATER INVOLVED ALL THE HOBBITS IN THE GREAT EVENTS OF THAT AGE THAT ARE HERE RELATED
MANY HOWEVER MAY WISH TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS REMARKABLE PEOPLE FROM THE OUTSET WHILE SOME MAY NOT POSSESS THE EARLIER BOOK FOR SUCH READERS A FEW NOTES ON THE MORE IMPORTANT POINTS ARE HERE COLLECTED FROM HOBBITLORE AND THE FIRST ADVENTURE IS BRIEFLY RECALLED
HOBBITS ARE AN UNOBTRUSIVE BUT VERY ANCIENT PEOPLE MORE NUMEROUS FORMERLY THAN THEY ARE TODAY FOR THEY LOVE PEACE AND QUIET AND GOOD TILLED EARTH A WELLORDERED AND WELLFARMED COUNTRYSIDE WAS THEIR FAVOURITE HAUNT THEY DO NOT AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND OR LIKE MACHINES MORE COMPLICATED THAN A FORGEBELLOWS A WATERMILL OR A HANDLOOM THOUGH THEY WERE SKILFUL WITH TOOLS EVEN IN ANCIENT DAYS THEY WERE AS A RULE SHY OF THE BIG FOLK AS THEY CALL US AND NOW THEY AVOID US WITH DISMAY AND ARE BECOMING HARD TO FIND THEY ARE QUICK OF HEARING AND SHARPEYED AND THOUGH THEY ARE INCLINED TO BE FAT AND DO NOT HURRY UNNECESSARILY THEY ARE NONETHELESS NIMBLE AND DEFT IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THEY POSSESSED FROM THE FIRST THE ART OF DISAPPEARING SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY WHEN LARGE FOLK WHOM THEY DO NOT WISH TO MEET COME BLUNDERING BY AND THIS AN THEY HAVE DEVELOPED UNTIL TO MEN IT MAY SEEM MAGICAL BUT HOBBITS HAVE NEVER IN FACT STUDIED MAGIC OF ANY KIND AND THEIR ELUSIVENESS IS DUE SOLELY TO A PROFESSIONAL SKILL THAT HEREDITY AND PRACTICE AND A CLOSE FRIENDSHIP WITH THE EARTH HAVE RENDERED INIMITABLE BY BIGGER AND CLUMSIER RACES
FOR THEY ARE A LITTLE PEOPLE SMALLER THAN DWARVES LESS TOUT AND STOCKY THAT IS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY MUCH SHORTER THEIR HEIGHT IS VARIABLE RANGING BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR FEET OF OUR MEASURE THEY SELDOM NOW REACH THREE FEET BUT THEY HAVE DWINDLED THEY SAY AND IN ANCIENT DAYS THEY WERE TALLER ACCORDING TO THE RED BOOK BANDOBRAS TOOK BULLROARER SON OF ISENGRIM THE SECOND WAS FOUR FOOT FIVE AND ABLE TO RIDE A HORSE HE WAS SURPASSED IN ALL HOBBIT RECORDS ONLY BY TWO FAMOUS CHARACTERS OF OLD BUT THAT CURIOUS MATTER IS DEALT WITH IN THIS BOOK
AS FOR THE HOBBITS OF THE SHIRE WITH WHOM THESE TALES ARE CONCERNED IN THE DAYS OF THEIR PEACE AND PROSPERITY THEY WERE A MERRY FOLK THEY DRESSED IN BRIGHT COLOURS BEING NOTABLY FOND OF YELLOW AND GREEN BUT THEY SELDOM WORE SHOES SINCE THEIR FEET HAD TOUGH LEATHERY SOLES AND WERE CLAD IN A THICK CURLING HAIR MUCH LIKE THE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS WHICH WAS COMMONLY BROWN THUS THE ONLY CRAFT LITTLE PRACTISED AMONG THEM WAS SHOEMAKING BUT THEY HAD LONG AND SKILFUL FINGERS AND COULD MAKE MANY OTHER USEFUL AND COMELY THINGS THEIR FACES WERE AS A RULE GOODNATURED RATHER THAN BEAUTIFUL BROAD BRIGHTEYED REDCHEEKED WITH MOUTHS APT TO LAUGHTER AND TO EATING AND DRINKING AND LAUGH THEY DID AND EAT AND DRINK OFTEN AND HEARTILY BEING FOND OF SIMPLE JESTS AT ALL TIMES AND OF SIX MEALS A DAY WHEN THEY COULD GET THEM THEY WERE HOSPITABLE AND DELIGHTED IN PARTIES AND IN PRESENTS WHICH THEY GAVE AWAY FREELY AND EAGERLY ACCEPTED
IT IS PLAIN INDEED THAT IN SPITE OF LATER ESTRANGEMENT HOBBITS ARE RELATIVES OF OURS FAR NEARER TO US THAN ELVES OR EVEN THAN DWARVES OF OLD THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGES OF MEN AFTER THEIR OWN FASHION AND LIKED AND DISLIKED MUCH THE SAME THINGS AS MEN DID BUT WHAT EXACTLY OUR RELATIONSHIP IS CAN NO LONGER BE DISCOVERED THE BEGINNING OF HOBBITS LIES FAR BACK IN THE ELDER DAYS THAT ARE NOW LOST AND FORGOTTEN ONLY THE ELVES STILL PRESERVE ANY RECORDS OF THAT VANISHED TIME AND THEIR TRADITIONS ARE CONCERNED ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH THEIR OWN HISTORY IN WHICH MEN APPEAR SELDOM AND HOBBITS ARE NOT MENTIONED AT ALL YET IT IS CLEAR THAT HOBBITS HAD IN FACT LIVED QUIETLY IN MIDDLEEARTH FOR MANY LONG YEARS BEFORE OTHER FOLK BECAME EVEN AWARE OF THEM AND THE WORLD BEING AFTER ALL FULL OF STRANGE CREATURES BEYOND COUNT THESE LITTLE PEOPLE SEEMED OF VERY LITTLE IMPORTANCE BUT IN THE DAYS OF BILBO AND OF FRODO HIS HEIR THEY SUDDENLY BECAME BY NO WISH OF THEIR OWN BOTH IMPORTANT AND RENOWNED AND TROUBLED THE COUNSELS OF THE WISE AND THE GREAT
THOSE DAYS THE THIRD AGE OF MIDDLEEARTH ARE NOW LONG PAST AND THE SHAPE OF ALL LANDS HAS BEEN CHANGED BUT THE REGIONS IN WHICH HOBBITS THEN LIVED WERE DOUBTLESS THE SAME AS THOSE IN WHICH THEY STILL LINGER THE NORTHWEST OF THE OLD WORLD EAST OF THE SEA OF THEIR ORIGINAL HOME THE HOBBITS IN BILBOS TIME PRESERVED NO KNOWLEDGE A LOVE OF LEARNING OTHER THAN GENEALOGICAL LORE WAS FAR FROM GENERAL AMONG THEM BUT THERE REMAINED STILL A FEW IN THE OLDER FAMILIES WHO STUDIED THEIR OWN BOOKS AND EVEN GATHERED REPORTS OF OLD TIMES AND DISTANT LANDS FROM ELVES DWARVES AND MEN THEIR OWN RECORDS BEGAN ONLY AFTER THE SETTLEMENT OF THE SHIRE AND THEIR MOST ANCIENT LEGENDS HARDLY LOOKED FURTHER BACK THAN THEIR WANDERING DAYS IT IS CLEAR NONETHELESS FROM THESE LEGENDS AND FROM THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR PECULIAR WORDS AND CUSTOMS THAT LIKE MANY OTHER FOLK HOBBITS HAD IN THE DISTANT PAST MOVED WESTWARD THEIR EARLIEST TALES SEEM TO GLIMPSE A TIME WHEN THEY DWELT IN THE UPPER VALES OF ANDUIN BETWEEN THE EAVES OF GREENWOOD THE GREAT AND THE MISTY MOUNTAINS WHY THEY LATER UNDERTOOK THE HARD AND PERILOUS CROSSING OF THE MOUNTAINS INTO ERIADOR IS NO LONGER CERTAIN THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS SPEAK OF THE MULTIPLYING OF MEN IN THE LAND AND OF A SHADOW THAT FELL ON THE FOREST SO THAT IT BECAME DARKENED AND ITS NEW NAME WAS MIRKWOOD
BEFORE THE CROSSING OF THE MOUNTAINS THE HOBBITS HAD ALREADY BECOME DIVIDED INTO THREE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT BREEDS HARFOOTS STOORS AND FALLOHIDES THE HARFOOTS WERE BROWNER OF SKIN SMALLER AND SHORTER AND THEY WERE BEARDLESS AND BOOTLESS THEIR HANDS AND FEET WERE NEAT AND NIMBLE AND THEY PREFERRED HIGHLANDS AND HILLSIDES THE STOORS WERE BROADER HEAVIER IN BUILD THEIR FEET AND HANDS WERE LARGER AND THEY PREFERRED FLAT LANDS AND RIVERSIDES THE FALLOHIDES WERE FAIRER OF SKIN AND ALSO OF HAIR AND THEY WERE TALLER AND SLIMMER THAN THE OTHERS THEY WERE LOVERS OF TREES AND OF WOODLANDS
THE HARFOOTS HAD MUCH TO DO WITH DWARVES IN ANCIENT TIMES AND LONG LIVED IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAINS THEY MOVED WESTWARD EARLY AND ROAMED OVER ERIADOR AS FAR AS WEATHERTOP WHILE THE OTHERS WERE STILL IN THE WILDERLAND THEY WERE THE MOST NORMAL AND REPRESENTATIVE VARIETY OF HOBBIT AND FAR THE MOST NUMEROUS THEY WERE THE MOST INCLINED TO SETTLE IN ONE PLACE AND LONGEST PRESERVED THEIR ANCESTRAL HABIT OF LIVING IN TUNNELS AND HOLES
THE STOORS LINGERED LONG BY THE BANKS OF THE GREAT RIVER ANDUIN AND WERE LESS SHY OF MEN THEY CAME WEST AFTER THE HARFOOTS AND FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF THE LOUDWATER SOUTHWARDS AND THERE MANY OF THEM LONG DWELT BETWEEN THARBAD AND THE BORDERS OF DUNLAND BEFORE THEY MOVED NORTH AGAIN
THE FALLOHIDES THE LEAST NUMEROUS WERE A NORTHERLY BRANCH THEY WERE MORE FRIENDLY WITH ELVES THAN THE OTHER HOBBITS WERE AND HAD MORE SKILL IN LANGUAGE AND SONG THAN IN HANDICRAFTS AND OF OLD THEY PREFERRED HUNTING TO TILLING THEY CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF RIVENDELL AND CAME DOWN THE RIVER HOARWELL IN ERIADOR THEY SOON MINGLED WITH THE OTHER KINDS THAT HAD PRECEDED THEM BUT BEING SOMEWHAT BOLDER AND MORE ADVENTUROUS THEY WERE OFTEN FOUND AS LEADERS OR CHIEFTAINS AMONG CLANS OF HARFOOTS OR STOORS EVEN IN BILBOS TIME THE STRONG FALLOHIDISH STRAIN COULD STILL BE NOTED AMONG THE GREATER FAMILIES SUCH AS THE TOOKS AND THE MASTERS OF BUCKLAND
IN THE WESTLANDS OF ERIADOR BETWEEN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND THE MOUNTAINS OF LUNE THE HOBBITS FOUND BOTH MEN AND ELVES INDEED A REMNANT STILL DWELT THERE OF THE DUNEDAIN THE KINGS OF MEN THAT CAME OVER THE SEA OUT OF WESTERNESSE BUT THEY WERE DWINDLING FAST AND THE LANDS OF THEIR NORTH KINGDOM WERE FALLING FAR AND WIDE INTO WASTE THERE WAS ROOM AND TO SPARE FOR INCOMERS AND ERE LONG THE HOBBITS BEGAN TO SETTLE IN ORDERED COMMUNITIES MOST OF THEIR EARLIER SETTLEMENTS HAD LONG DISAPPEARED AND BEEN FORGOTTEN IN BILBOS TIME BUT ONE OF THE FIRST TO BECOME IMPORTANT STILL ENDURED THOUGH REDUCED IN SIZE THIS WAS AT BREE AND IN THE CHETWOOD THAT LAY ROUND ABOUT SOME FORTY MILES EAST OF THE SHIRE
IT WAS IN THESE EARLY DAYS DOUBTLESS THAT THE HOBBITS LEARNED THEIR LETTERS AND BEGAN TO WRITE AFTER THE MANNER OF THE DUNEDAIN WHO HAD IN THEIR TURN LONG BEFORE LEARNED THE ART FROM THE ELVES AND IN THOSE DAYS ALSO THEY FORGOT WHATEVER LANGUAGES THEY HAD USED BEFORE AND SPOKE EVER AFTER THE COMMON SPEECH THE WESTRON AS IT WAS NAMED THAT WAS CURRENT THROUGH ALL THE LANDS OF THE KINGS FROM ARNOR TO GONDOR AND ABOUT ALL THE COASTS OF THE SEA FROM BELFALAS TO LUNE YET THEY KEPT A FEW WORDS OF THEIR OWN AS WELL AS THEIR OWN NAMES OF MONTHS AND DAYS AND A GREAT STORE OF PERSONAL NAMES OUT OF THE PAST
ABOUT THIS TIME LEGEND AMONG THE HOBBITS FIRST BECOMES HISTORY WITH A RECKONING OF YEARS FOR IT WAS IN THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIRST YEAR OF THE THIRD AGE THAT THE FALLOHIDE BROTHERS MARCHO AND BLANCO SET OUT FROM BREE AND HAVING OBTAINED PERMISSION FROM THE HIGH KING AT FORNOST1 THEY CROSSED THE BROWN RIVER BARANDUIN WITH A GREAT FOLLOWING OF HOBBITS THEY PASSED OVER THE BRIDGE OF STONEBOWS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT IN THE DAYS OF THE POWER OF THE NORTH KINGDOM AND THEY TOOK ALL THE LAND BEYOND TO DWELL IN BETWEEN THE RIVER AND THE FAR DOWNS ALL THAT WAS DEMANDED OF THEM WAS THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP THE GREAT BRIDGE IN REPAIR AND ALL OTHER BRIDGES AND ROADS SPEED THE KINGS MESSENGERS AND ACKNOWLEDGE HIS LORDSHIP
THUS BEGAN THE SHIRERECKONING FOR THE YEAR OF THE CROSSING OF THE BRANDYWINE AS THE HOBBITS TURNED THE NAME BECAME YEAR ONE OF THE SHIRE AND ALL LATER DATES WERE RECKONED FROM IT2AT ONCE THE WESTERN HOBBITS FELL IN LOVE WITH THEIR NEW LAND AND THEY REMAINED THERE AND SOON PASSED ONCE MORE OUT OF THE HISTORY OF MEN AND OF ELVES WHILE THERE WAS STILL A KING THEY WERE IN NAME HIS SUBJECTS BUT THEY WERE IN FACT RULED BY THEIR OWN CHIEFTAINS AND MEDDLED NOT AT ALL WITH EVENTS IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE TO THE LAST BATTLE AT FORNOST WITH THE WITCHLORD OF ANGMAR THEY SENT SOME BOWMEN TO THE AID OF THE KING OR SO THEY MAINTAINED THOUGH NO TALES OF MEN RECORD IT BUT IN THAT WAR THE NORTH KINGDOM ENDED AND THEN THE HOBBITS TOOK THE LAND FOR THEIR OWN AND THEY CHOSE FROM THEIR OWN CHIEFS A THAIN TO HOLD THE AUTHORITY OF THE KING THAT WAS GONE THERE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS THEY WERE LITTLE TROUBLED BY WARS AND THEY PROSPERED AND MULTIPLIED AFTER THE DARK PLAGUE SR 37 UNTIL THE DISASTER OF THE LONG WINTER AND THE FAMINE THAT FOLLOWED IT MANY THOUSANDS THEN PERISHED BUT THE DAYS OF DEARTH 115860 WERE AT THE TIME OF THIS TALE LONG PAST AND THE HOBBITS HAD AGAIN BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO PLENTY THE LAND WAS RICH AND KINDLY AND THOUGH IT HAD LONG BEEN DESERTED WHEN THEY ENTERED IT IT HAD BEFORE BEEN WELL TILLED AND THERE THE KING HAD ONCE HAD MANY FARMS CORNLANDS VINEYARDS AND WOODS
FORTY LEAGUES IT STRETCHED FROM THE FAR DOWNS TO THE BRANDYWINE BRIDGE AND FIFTY FROM THE NORTHERN MOORS TO THE MARSHES IN THE SOUTH THE HOBBITS NAMED IT THE SHIRE AS THE REGION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR THAIN AND A DISTRICT OF WELLORDERED BUSINESS AND THERE IN THAT PLEASANT CORNER OF THE WORLD THEY PLIED THEIR WELLORDERED BUSINESS OF LIVING AND THEY HEEDED LESS AND LESS THE WORLD OUTSIDE WHERE DARK THINGS MOVED UNTIL THEY CAME TO THINK THAT PEACE AND PLENTY WERE THE RULE IN MIDDLEEARTH AND THE RIGHT OF ALL SENSIBLE FOLK THEY FORGOT OR IGNORED WHAT LITTLE THEY HAD EVER KNOWN OF THE GUARDIANS AND OF THE LABOURS OF THOSE THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE LONG PEACE OF THE SHIRE THEY WERE IN FACT SHELTERED BUT THEY HAD CEASED TO REMEMBER IT
AT NO TIME HAD HOBBITS OF ANY KIND BEEN WARLIKE AND THEY HAD NEVER FOUGHT AMONG THEMSELVES IN OLDEN DAYS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN OFTEN OBLIGED TO FIGHT TO MAINTAIN THEMSELVES IN A HARD WORLD BUT IN BILBOS TIME THAT WAS VERY ANCIENT HISTORY THE LAST BATTLE BEFORE THIS STORY OPENS AND INDEED THE ONLY ONE THAT HAD EVER BEEN FOUGHT WITHIN THE BORDERS OF THE SHIRE WAS BEYOND LIVING MEMORY THE BATTLE OF GREENFIELDS SR 1147 IN WHICH BANDOBRAS TOOK ROUTED AN INVASION OF ORCS EVEN THE WEATHERS HAD GROWN MILDER AND THE WOLVES THAT HAD ONCE COME RAVENING OUT OF THE NORTH IN BITTER WHITE WINTERS WERE NOW ONLY A GRANDFATHERS TALE SO THOUGH THERE WAS STILL SOME STORE OF WEAPONS IN THE SHIRE THESE WERE USED MOSTLY AS TROPHIES HANGING ABOVE HEARTHS OR ON WALLS OR GATHERED INTO THE MUSEUM AT MICHEL DELVING THE MATHOMHOUSE IT WAS CALLED FOR ANYTHING THAT HOBBITS HAD NO IMMEDIATE USE FOR BUT WERE UNWILLING TO THROW AWAY THEY CALLED A MATHOM THEIR DWELLINGS WERE APT TO BECOME RATHER CROWDED WITH MATHOMS AND MANY OF THE PRESENTS THAT PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND WERE OF THAT SORT
NONETHELESS EASE AND PEACE HAD LEFT THIS PEOPLE STILL CURIOUSLY TOUGH THEY WERE IF IT CAME TO IT DIFFICULT TO DAUNT OR TO KILL AND THEY WERE PERHAPS SO UNWEARYINGLY FOND OF GOOD THINGS NOT LEAST BECAUSE THEY COULD WHEN PUT TO IT DO WITHOUT THEM AND COULD SURVIVE ROUGH HANDLING BY GRIEF FOE OR WEATHER IN A WAY THAT ASTONISHED THOSE WHO DID NOT KNOW THEM WELL AND LOOKED NO FURTHER THAN THEIR BELLIES AND THEIR WELLFED FACES THOUGH SLOW TO QUARREL AND FOR SPORT KILLING NOTHING THAT LIVED THEY WERE DOUGHTY AT BAY AND AT NEED COULD STILL HANDLE ARMS THEY SHOT WELL WITH THE BOW FOR THEY WERE KEENEYED AND SURE AT THE MARK NOT ONLY WITH BOWS AND ARROWS IF ANY HOBBIT STOOPED FOR A STONE IT WAS WELL TO GET QUICKLY UNDER COVER AS ALL TRESPASSING BEASTS KNEW VERY WELL
ALL HOBBITS HAD ORIGINALLY LIVED IN HOLES IN THE GROUND OR SO THEY BELIEVED AND IN SUCH DWELLINGS THEY STILL FELT MOST AT HOME BUT IN THE COURSE OF TIME THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ADOPT OTHER FORMS OF ABODE ACTUALLY IN THE SHIRE IN BILBOS DAYS IT WAS AS A RULE ONLY THE RICHEST AND THE POOREST HOBBITS THAT MAINTAINED THE OLD CUSTOM THE POOREST WENT ON LIVING IN BURROWS OF THE MOST PRIMITIVE KIND MERE HOLES INDEED WITH ONLY ONE WINDOW OR NONE WHILE THE WELLTODO STILL CONSTRUCTED MORE LUXURIOUS VERSIONS OF THE SIMPLE DIGGINGS OF OLD BUT SUITABLE SITES FOR THESE LARGE AND RAMIFYING TUNNELS OR SMIALS AS THEY CALLED THEM WERE NOT EVERYWHERE TO BE FOUND AND IN THE FLATS AND THE LOWLYING DISTRICTS THE HOBBITS AS THEY MULTIPLIED BEGAN TO BUILD ABOVE GROUND INDEED EVEN IN THE HILLY REGIONS AND THE OLDER VILLAGES SUCH AS HOBBITON OR TUCKBOROUGH OR IN THE CHIEF TOWNSHIP OF THE SHIRE MICHEL DELVING ON THE WHITE DOWNS THERE WERE NOW MANY HOUSES OF WOOD BRICK OR STONE THESE WERE SPECIALLY FAVOURED BY MILLERS SMITHS ROPERS AND CARTWRIGHTS AND OTHERS OF THAT SORT FOR EVEN WHEN THEY HAD HOLES TO LIVE IN HOBBITS HAD LONG BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BUILD SHEDS AND WORKSHOPS
THE HABIT OF BUILDING FARMHOUSES AND BARNS WAS SAID TO HAVE BEGUN AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE MARISH DOWN BY THE BRANDYWINE THE HOBBITS OF THAT QUARTER THE EASTFARTHING WERE RATHER LARGE AND HEAVYLEGGED AND THEY WORE DWARFBOOTS IN MUDDY WEATHER BUT THEY WERE WELL KNOWN TO BE STOORS IN A LARGE PART OF THEIR BLOOD AS INDEED WAS SHOWN BY THE DOWN THAT MANY GREW ON THEIR CHINS NO HARFOOT OR FALLOHIDE HAD ANY TRACE OF A BEARD INDEED THE FOLK OF THE MARISH AND OF BUCKLAND EAST OF THE RIVER WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS OCCUPIED CAME FOR THE MOST PART LATER INTO THE SHIRE UP FROM SOUTHAWAY AND THEY STILL HAD MANY PECULIAR NAMES AND STRANGE WORDS NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THE SHIRE
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CRAFT OF BUILDING AS MANY OTHER CRAFTS BESIDE WAS DERIVED FROM THE DUNEDAIN BUT THE HOBBITS MAY HAVE LEARNED IT DIRECT FROM THE ELVES THE TEACHERS OF MEN IN THEIR YOUTH FOR THE ELVES OF THE HIGH KINDRED HAD NOT YET FORSAKEN MIDDLEEARTH AND THEY DWELT STILL AT THAT TIME AT THE GREY HAVENS AWAY TO THE WEST AND IN OTHER PLACES WITHIN REACH OF THE SHIRE THREE ELFTOWERS OF IMMEMORIAL AGE WERE STILL TO BE SEEN ON THE TOWER HILLS BEYOND THE WESTERN MARCHES THEY SHONE FAR OFF IN THE MOONLIGHT THE TALLEST WAS FURTHEST AWAY STANDING ALONE UPON A GREEN MOUND THE HOBBITS OF THE WESTFARTHING SAID THAT ONE COULD SEE THE SEA FROM THE LOP OF THAT TOWER BUT NO HOBBIT HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO CLIMB IT INDEED FEW HOBBITS HAD EVER SEEN OR SAILED UPON THE SEA AND FEWER STILL HAD EVER RETURNED TO REPORT IT MOST HOBBITS REGARDED EVEN RIVERS AND SMALL BOATS WITH DEEP MISGIVINGS AND NOT MANY OF THEM COULD SWIM AND AS THE DAYS OF THE SHIRE LENGTHENED THEY SPOKE LESS AND LESS WITH THE ELVES AND GREW AFRAID OF THEM AND DISTRUSTFUL OF THOSE THAT HAD DEALINGS WITH THEM AND THE SEA BECAME A WORD OF FEAR AMONG THEM AND A TOKEN OF DEATH AND THEY TURNED THEIR FACES AWAY FROM THE HILLS IN THE WEST
THE CRAFT OF BUILDING MAY HAVE COME FROM ELVES OR MEN BUT THE HOBBITS USED IT IN THEIR OWN FASHION THEY DID NOT GO IN FOR TOWERS THEIR HOUSES WERE USUALLY LONG LOW AND COMFORTABLE THE OLDEST KIND WERE INDEED NO MORE THAN BUILT IMITATIONS OF SMIALS THATCHED WITH DRY GRASS OR STRAW OR ROOFED WITH TURVES AND HAVING WALLS SOMEWHAT BULGED THAT STAGE HOWEVER BELONGED TO THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SHIRE AND HOBBITBUILDING HAD LONG SINCE BEEN ALTERED IMPROVED BY DEVICES LEARNED FROM DWARVES OR DISCOVERED BY THEMSELVES A PREFERENCE FOR ROUND WINDOWS AND EVEN ROUND DOORS WAS THE CHIEF REMAINING PECULIARITY OF HOBBITARCHITECTURE
THE HOUSES AND THE HOLES OF SHIREHOBBITS WERE OFTEN LARGE AND INHABITED BY LARGE FAMILIES BILBO AND FRODO BAGGINS WERE AS BACHELORS VERY EXCEPTIONAL AS THEY WERE ALSO IN MANY OTHER WAYS SUCH AS THEIR FRIENDSHIP WITH THE ELVES SOMETIMES AS IN THE CASE OF THE TOOKS OF GREAT SMIALS OR THE BRANDYBUCKS OF BRANDY HALL MANY GENERATIONS OF RELATIVES LIVED IN COMPARATIVE PEACE TOGETHER IN ONE ANCESTRAL AND MANYTUNNELLED MANSION ALL HOBBITS WERE IN ANY CASE CLANNISH AND RECKONED UP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH GREAT CARE THEY DREW LONG AND ELABORATE FAMILYTREES WITH INNUMERABLE BRANCHES IN DEALING WITH HOBBITS IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHO IS RELATED TO WHOM AND IN WHAT DEGREE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS BOOK TO SET OUT A FAMILYTREE THAT INCLUDED EVEN THE MORE IMPORTANT MEMBERS OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FAMILIES AT THE TIME WHICH THESE TALES TELL OF THE GENEALOGICAL TREES AT THE END OF THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH ARE A SMALL BOOK IN THEMSELVES AND ALL BUT HOBBITS WOULD FIND THEM EXCEEDINGLY DULL HOBBITS DELIGHTED IN SUCH THINGS IF THEY WERE ACCURATE THEY LIKED TO HAVE BOOKS FILLED WITH THINGS THAT THEY ALREADY KNEW SET OUT FAIR AND SQUARE WITH NO CONTRADICTIONS



2 CONCERNING PIPEWEED

THERE IS ANOTHER ASTONISHING THING ABOUT HOBBITS OF OLD THAT MUST BE MENTIONED AN ASTONISHING HABIT THEY IMBIBED OR INHALED THROUGH PIPES OF CLAY OR WOOD THE SMOKE OF THE BURNING LEAVES OF A HERB WHICH THEY CALLED PIPEWEED OR LEAF A VARIETY PROBABLY OF NICOTIANA A GREAT DEAL OF MYSTERY SURROUNDS THE ORIGIN OF THIS PECULIAR CUSTOM OR ART AS THE HOBBITS PREFERRED TO CALL IT ALL THAT COULD BE DISCOVERED ABOUT IT IN ANTIQUITY WAS PUT TOGETHER BY MERIADOC BRANDYBUCK LATER MASTER OF BUCKLAND AND SINCE HE AND THE TOBACCO OF THE SOUTHFARTHING PLAY A PART IN THE HISTORY THAT FOLLOWS HIS REMARKS IN THE INTRODUCTION TO HIS HERBLORE OF THE SHIRE MAY BE QUOTED
THIS HE SAYS IS THE ONE ART THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY CLAIM TO BE OUR OWN INVENTION WHEN HOBBITS FIRST BEGAN TO SMOKE IS NOT KNOWN ALL THE LEGENDS AND FAMILY HISTORIES TAKE IT FOR GRANTED FOR AGES FOLK IN THE SHIRE SMOKED VARIOUS HERBS SOME FOULER SOME SWEETER BUT ALL ACCOUNTS AGREE THAT TOBOLD HORNBLOWER OF LONGBOTTOM IN THE SOUTHFARTHING FIRST GREW THE TRUE PIPEWEED IN HIS GARDENS IN THE DAYS OF ISENGRIM THE SECOND ABOUT THE YEAR 1070 OF SHIRERECKONING THE BEST HOMEGROWN STILL COMES FROM THAT DISTRICT ESPECIALLY THE VARIETIES NOW KNOWN AS LONGBOTTOM LEAF OLD TOBY AND SOUTHERN STAR
HOW OLD TOBY CAME BY THE PLANT IS NOT RECORDED FOR TO HIS DYING DAY HE WOULD NOT TELL HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT HERBS BUT HE WAS NO TRAVELLER IT IS SAID THAT IN HIS YOUTH HE WENT OFTEN TO BREE THOUGH HE CERTAINLY NEVER WENT FURTHER FROM THE SHIRE THAN THAT IT IS THUS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT HE LEARNED OF THIS PLANT IN BREE WHERE NOW AT ANY RATE IT GROWS WELL ON THE SOUTH SLOPES OF THE HILL THE BREEHOBBITS CLAIM TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ACTUAL SMOKERS OF THE PIPEWEED THEY CLAIM OF COURSE TO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF THE SHIRE WHOM THEY REFER TO AS COLONISTS BUT IN THIS CASE THEIR CLAIM IS I THINK LIKELY TO BE TRUE AND CERTAINLY IT WAS FROM BREE THAT THE ART OF SMOKING THE GENUINE WEED SPREAD IN THE RECENT CENTURIES AMONG DWARVES AND SUCH OTHER FOLK RANGERS WIZARDS OR WANDERERS AS STILL PASSED TO AND FRO THROUGH THAT ANCIENT ROADMEETING THE HOME AND CENTRE OF THE AN IS THUS TO BE FOUND IN THE OLD INN OF BREE THE PRANCING PONY THAT HAS BEEN KEPT BY THE FAMILY OF BUTTERBUR FROM TIME BEYOND RECORD
ALL THE SAME OBSERVATIONS THAT I HAVE MADE ON MY OWN MANY JOURNEYS SOUTH HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT THE WEED ITSELF IS NOT NATIVE TO OUR PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT CAME NORTHWARD FROM THE LOWER ANDUIN WHITHER IT WAS I SUSPECT ORIGINALLY BROUGHT OVER SEA BY THE MEN OF WESTERNESSE IT GROWS ABUNDANTLY IN GONDOR AND THERE IS RICHER AND LARGER THAN IN THE NORTH WHERE IT IS NEVER FOUND WILD AND FLOURISHES ONLY IN WARM SHELTERED PLACES LIKE LONGBOTTOM THE MEN OF GONDOR CALL IT SWEET GALENAS AND ESTEEM IT ONLY FOR THE FRAGRANCE OF ITS FLOWERS FROM THAT LAND IT MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED UP THE GREENWAY DURING THE LONG CENTURIES BETWEEN THE COMING OF ELENDIL AND OUR OWN DAY BUT EVEN THE DUNEDAIN OF GONDOR ALLOW US THIS CREDIT HOBBITS FIRST PUT IT INTO PIPES NOT EVEN THE WIZARDS FIRST THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE WE DID THOUGH ONE WIZARD THAT I KNEW TOOK UP THE ART LONG AGO AND BECAME AS SKILFUL IN IT AS IN ALL OTHER THINGS THAT HE PUT HIS MIND TO



3 OF THE ORDERING OF THE SHIRE

THE SHIRE WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR QUARTERS THE FARTHINGS ALREADY REFERRED TO NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST AND THESE AGAIN EACH INTO A NUMBER OF FOLKLANDS WHICH STILL BORE THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE OLD LEADING FAMILIES ALTHOUGH BY THE TIME OF THIS HISTORY THESE NAMES WERE NO LONGER FOUND ONLY IN THEIR PROPER FOLKLANDS NEARLY ALL TOOKS STILL LIVED IN THE TOOKLAND BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE OF MANY OTHER FAMILIES SUCH AS THE BAGGINSES OR THE BOFFINS OUTSIDE THE FARTHINGS WERE THE EAST AND WEST MARCHES THE BUCKLAND SEE BEGINNING OF CHAPTER V BOOK I AND THE WESTMARCH ADDED TO THE SHIRE IN SR 1462
THE SHIRE AT THIS TIME HAD HARDLY ANY GOVERNMENT FAMILIES FOR THE MOST PART MANAGED THEIR OWN AFFAIRS GROWING FOOD AND EATING IT OCCUPIED MOST OF THEIR TIME IN OTHER MATTERS THEY WERE AS A RULE GENEROUS AND NOT GREEDY BUT CONTENTED AND MODERATE SO THAT ESTATES FARMS WORKSHOPS AND SMALL TRADES TENDED TO REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR GENERATIONS
THERE REMAINED OF COURSE THE ANCIENT TRADITION CONCERNING THE HIGH KING AT FORNOST OR NORBURY AS THEY CALLED IT AWAY NORTH OF THE SHIRE BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO KING FOR NEARLY A THOUSAND YEARS AND EVEN THE RUINS OF KINGS NORBURY WERE COVERED WITH GRASS YET THE HOBBITS STILL SAID OF WILD FOLK AND WICKED THINGS SUCH AS TROLLS THAT THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF THE KING FOR THEY ATTRIBUTED TO THE KING OF OLD ALL THEIR ESSENTIAL LAWS AND USUALLY THEY KEPT THE LAWS OF FREE WILL BECAUSE THEY WERE THE RULES AS THEY SAID BOTH ANCIENT AND JUST
IT IS TRUE THAT THE TOOK FAMILY HAD LONG BEEN PREEMINENT FOR THE OFFICE OF THAIN HAD PASSED TO THEM FROM THE OLDBUCKS SOME CENTURIES BEFORE AND THE CHIEF TOOK HAD BORNE THAT TITLE EVER SINCE THE THAIN WAS THE MASTER OF THE SHIREMOOT AND CAPTAIN OF THE SHIREMUSTER AND THE HOBBITRYINARMS BUT AS MUSTER AND MOOT WERE ONLY HELD IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY WHICH NO LONGER OCCURRED THE THAINSHIP HAD CEASED TO BE MORE THAN A NOMINAL DIGNITY THE TOOK FAMILY WAS STILL INDEED ACCORDED A SPECIAL RESPECT FOR IT REMAINED BOTH NUMEROUS AND EXCEEDINGLY WEALTHY AND WAS LIABLE TO PRODUCE IN EVERY GENERATION STRONG CHARACTERS OF PECULIAR HABITS AND EVEN ADVENTUROUS TEMPERAMENT THE LATTER QUALITIES HOWEVER WERE NOW RATHER TOLERATED IN THE RICH THAN GENERALLY APPROVED THE CUSTOM ENDURED NONETHELESS OF REFERRING TO THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AS THE TOOK AND OF ADDING TO HIS NAME IF REQUIRED A NUMBER SUCH AS ISENGRIM THE SECOND FOR INSTANCE
THE ONLY REAL OFFICIAL IN THE SHIRE AT THIS DATE WAS THE MAYOR OF MICHEL DELVING OR OF THE SHIRE WHO WAS ELECTED EVERY SEVEN YEARS AT THE FREE FAIR ON THE WHITE DOWNS AT THE LITHE THAT IS AT MIDSUMMER AS MAYOR ALMOST HIS ONLY DUTY WAS TO PRESIDE AT BANQUETS GIVEN ON THE SHIREHOLIDAYS WHICH OCCURRED AT FREQUENT INTERVALS BUT THE OFFICES OF POSTMASTER AND FIRST SHIRRIFF WERE ATTACHED TO THE MAYORALTY SO THAT HE MANAGED BOTH THE MESSENGER SERVICE AND THE WATCH THESE WERE THE ONLY SHIRESERVICES AND THE MESSENGERS WERE THE MOST NUMEROUS AND MUCH THE BUSIER OF THE TWO BY NO MEANS ALL HOBBITS WERE LETTERED BUT THOSE WHO WERE WROTE CONSTANTLY TO ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND A SELECTION OF THEIR RELATIONS WHO LIVED FURTHER OFF THAN AN AFTERNOONS WALK
THE SHIRRIFFS WAS THE NAME THAT THE HOBBITS GAVE TO THEIR POLICE OR THE NEAREST EQUIVALENT THAT THEY POSSESSED THEY HAD OF COURSE NO UNIFORMS SUCH THINGS BEING QUITE UNKNOWN ONLY A FEATHER IN THEIR CAPS AND THEY WERE IN PRACTICE RATHER HAYWARDS THAN POLICEMEN MORE CONCERNED WITH THE STRAYINGS OF BEASTS THAN OF PEOPLE THERE WERE IN ALL THE SHIRE ONLY TWELVE OF THEM THREE IN EACH FARTHING FOR INSIDE WORK A RATHER LARGER BODY VARYING AT NEED WAS EMPLOYED TO BEAT THE BOUNDS AND TO SEE THAT OUTSIDERS OF ANY KIND GREAT OR SMALL DID NOT MAKE THEMSELVES A NUISANCE
AT THE TIME WHEN THIS STORY BEGINS THE BOUNDERS AS THEY WERE CALLED HAD BEEN GREATLY INCREASED THERE WERE MANY REPORTS AND COMPLAINTS OF STRANGE PERSONS AND CREATURES PROWLING ABOUT THE BORDERS OR OVER THEM THE FIRST SIGN THAT ALL WAS NOT QUITE AS IT SHOULD BE AND ALWAYS HAD BEEN EXCEPT IN TALES AND LEGENDS OF LONG AGO FEW HEEDED THE SIGN AND NOT EVEN BILBO YET HAD ANY NOTION OF WHAT IT PORTENDED SIXTY YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE HE SET OUT ON HIS MEMORABLE JOURNEY AND HE WAS OLD EVEN FOR HOBBITS WHO REACHED A HUNDRED AS OFTEN AS NOT BUT MUCH EVIDENTLY STILL REMAINED OF THE CONSIDERABLE WEALTH THAT HE HAD BROUGHT BACK HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE HE REVEALED TO NO ONE NOT EVEN TO FRODO HIS FAVOURITE NEPHEW AND HE STILL KEPT SECRET THE RING THAT HE HAD FOUND



4 OF THE FINDING OF THE RING

AS IS TOLD IN THE HOBBIT THERE CAME ONE DAY TO BILBOS DOOR THE GREAT WIZARD GANDALF THE GREY AND THIRTEEN DWARVES WITH HIM NONE OTHER INDEED THAN THORIN OAKENSHIELD DESCENDANT OF KINGS AND HIS TWELVE COMPANIONS IN EXILE WITH THEM HE SET OUT TO HIS OWN LASTING ASTONISHMENT ON A MORNING OF APRIL IT BEING THEN THE YEAR 1341 SHIRERECKONING ON A QUEST OF GREAT TREASURE THE DWARFHOARDS OF THE KINGS UNDER THE MOUNTAIN BENEATH EREBOR IN DALE FAR OFF IN THE EAST THE QUEST WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THE DRAGON THAT GUARDED THE HOARD WAS DESTROYED YET THOUGH BEFORE ALL WAS WON THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES WAS FOUGHT AND THORIN WAS SLAIN AND MANY DEEDS OF RENOWN WERE DONE THE MATTER WOULD SCARCELY HAVE CONCERNED LATER HISTORY OR EARNED MORE THAN A NOTE IN THE LONG ANNALS OF THE THIRD AGE BUT FOR AN ACCIDENT BY THE WAY THE PARTY WAS ASSAILED BY ORCS IN A HIGH PASS OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AS THEY WENT TOWARDS WILDERLAND AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT BILBO WAS LOST FOR A WHILE IN THE BLACK ORCMINES DEEP UNDER THE MOUNTAINS AND THERE AS HE GROPED IN VAIN IN THE DARK HE PUT HIS HAND ON A RING LYING ON THE FLOOR OF A TUNNEL HE PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IT SEEMED THEN LIKE MERE LUCK
TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY OUT BILBO WENT ON DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL HE COULD GO NO FURTHER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL LAY A COLD LAKE FAR FROM THE LIGHT AND ON AN ISLAND OF ROCK IN THE WATER LIVED GOLLUM HE WAS A LOATHSOME LITTLE CREATURE HE PADDLED A SMALL BOAT WITH HIS LARGE FLAT FEET PEERING WITH PALE LUMINOUS EYES AND CATCHING BLIND FISH WITH HIS LONG FINGERS AND EATING THEM RAW HE ATE ANY LIVING THING EVEN ORC IF HE COULD CATCH IT AND STRANGLE IT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE HE POSSESSED A SECRET TREASURE THAT HAD COME TO HIM LONG AGES AGO WHEN HE STILL LIVED IN THE LIGHT A RING OF GOLD THAT MADE ITS WEARER INVISIBLE IT WAS THE ONE THING HE LOVED HIS PRECIOUS AND HE TALKED TO IT EVEN WHEN IT WAS NOT WITH HIM FOR HE KEPT IT HIDDEN SAFE IN A HOLE ON HIS ISLAND EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS HUNTING OR SPYING ON THE ORCS OF THE MINES
MAYBE HE WOULD HAVE ATTACKED BILBO AT ONCE IF THE RING HAD BEEN ON HIM WHEN THEY MET BUT IT WAS NOT AND THE HOBBIT HELD IN HIS HAND AN ELVISH KNIFE WHICH SERVED HIM AS A SWORD SO TO GAIN TIME GOLLUM CHALLENGED BILBO TO THE RIDDLEGAME SAYING THAT IF HE ASKED A RIDDLE WHICH BILBO COULD NOT GUESS THEN HE WOULD KILL HIM AND EAT HIM BUT IF BILBO DEFEATED HIM THEN HE WOULD DO AS BILBO WISHED HE WOULD LEAD HIM TO A WAY OUT OF THE TUNNELS
SINCE HE WAS LOST IN THE DARK WITHOUT HOPE AND COULD NEITHER GO ON NOR BACK BILBO ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE AND THEY ASKED ONE ANOTHER MANY RIDDLES IN THE END BILBO WON THE GAME MORE BY LUCK AS IT SEEMED THAN BY WITS FOR HE WAS STUMPED AT LAST FOR A RIDDLE TO ASK AND CRIED OUT AS HIS HAND CAME UPON THE RING HE LAD PICKED UP AND FORGOTTEN WHAT HAVE I GOT IN MY POCKET THIS GOLLUM FAILED TO ANSWER THOUGH HE DEMANDED THREE GUESSES
THE AUTHORITIES IT IS TRUE DIFFER WHETHER THIS LAST QUESTION WAS A MERE QUESTION AND NOT A RIDDLE ACCORDING TO THE STRICT RULES OF THE GAME BUT ALL AGREE THAT AFTER ACCEPTING IT AND TRYING TO GUESS THE ANSWER GOLLUM WAS BOUND BY HIS PROMISE AND BILBO PRESSED HIM TO KEEP HIS WORD FOR THE THOUGHT CAME TO HIM THAT THIS SLIMY CREATURE MIGHT PROVE FALSE EVEN THOUGH SUCH PROMISES WERE HELD SACRED AND OF OLD ALL BUT THE WICKEDEST THINGS FEARED TO BREAK THEM BUT AFTER AGES ALONE IN THE DARK GOLLUMS HEART WAS BLACK AND TREACHERY WAS IN IT HE SLIPPED AWAY AND RETURNED TO THE ISLAND OF WHICH BILBO KNEW NOTHING NOT FAR OFF IN THE DARK WATER THERE HE THOUGHT LAY HIS RING HE WAS HUNGRY NOW AND ANGRY AND ONCE HIS PRECIOUS WAS WITH HIM HE WOULD NOT FEAR ANY WEAPON AT ALL
BUT THE RING WAS NOT ON THE ISLAND HE HAD LOST IT IT WAS GONE HIS SCREECH SENT A SHIVER DOWN BILBOS BACK THOUGH HE DID NOT YET UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT GOLLUM HAD AT LAST LEAPED TO A GUESS TOO LATE WHAT HAS IT GOT IN ITS POCKETSES HE CRIED THE LIGHT IN HIS EYES WAS LIKE A GREEN FLAME AS HE SPED BACK TO MURDER THE HOBBIT AND RECOVER HIS PRECIOUS JUST IN TIME BILBO SAW HIS PERIL AND HE FLED BLINDLY UP THE PASSAGE AWAY FROM THE WATER AND ONCE MORE HE WAS SAVED BY HIS LUCK FOR JUST AS HE RAN HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND THE RING SLIPPED QUIETLY ON TO HIS FINGER SO IT WAS THAT GOLLUM PASSED HIM WITHOUT SEEING HIM AND WENT TO GUARD THE WAY OUT LEST THE THIEF SHOULD ESCAPE WARILY BILBO FOLLOWED HIM AS HE WENT ALONG CURSING AND TALKING TO HIMSELF ABOUT HIS PRECIOUS FROM WHICH TALK AT LAST EVEN BILBO GUESSED THE TRUTH AND HOPE CAME TO HIM IN THE DARKNESS HE HIMSELF HAD FOUND THE MARVELLOUS RING AND A CHANCE OF ESCAPE FROM THE ORCS AND FROM GOLLUM
AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO A HALT BEFORE AN UNSEEN OPENING THAT LED TO THE LOWER GATES OF THE MINES ON THE EASTWARD SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS THERE GOLLUM CROUCHED AT BAY SMELLING AND LISTENING AND BILBO WAS TEMPTED TO SLAY HIM WITH HIS SWORD BUT PITY STAYED HIM AND THOUGH HE KEPT THE RING IN WHICH HIS ONLY HOPE LAY HE WOULD NOT USE IT TO HELP HIM KILL THE WRETCHED CREATURE AT A DISADVANTAGE IN THE END GATHERING HIS COURAGE HE LEAPED OVER GOLLUM IN THE DARK AND FLED AWAY DOWN THE PASSAGE PURSUED BY HIS ENEMYS CRIES OF HATE AND DESPAIR THIEF THIEF BAGGINS WE HATES IT FOR EVER
NOW IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THIS IS NOT THE STORY AS BILBO FIRST TOLD IT TO HIS COMPANIONS TO THEM HIS ACCOUNT WAS THAT GOLLUM HAD PROMISED TO GIVE HIM A PRESENT IF HE WON THE GAME BUT WHEN GOLLUM WENT TO FETCH IT FROM HIS ISLAND HE FOUND THE TREASURE WAS GONE A MAGIC RING WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM LONG AGO ON HIS BIRTHDAY BILBO GUESSED THAT THIS WAS THE VERY RING THAT HE HAD FOUND AND AS HE HAD WON THE GAME IT WAS ALREADY HIS BY RIGHT BUT BEING IN A TIGHT PLACE HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT AND MADE GOLLUM SHOW HIM THE WAY OUT AS A REWARD INSTEAD OF A PRESENT THIS ACCOUNT BILBO SET DOWN IN HIS MEMOIRS AND HE SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE ALTERED IT HIMSELF NOT EVEN AFTER THE COUNCIL OF ELROND EVIDENTLY IT STILL APPEARED IN THE ORIGINAL RED BOOK AS IT DID IN SEVERAL OF THE COPIES AND ABSTRACTS BUT MANY COPIES CONTAIN THE TRUE ACCOUNT AS AN ALTERNATIVE DERIVED NO DOUBT FROM NOTES BY FRODO OR SAMWISE BOTH OF WHOM LEARNED THE TRUTH THOUGH THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO DELETE ANYTHING ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY THE OLD HOBBIT HIMSELF
GANDALF HOWEVER DISBELIEVED BILBOS FIRST STORY AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND HE CONTINUED TO BE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THE RING EVENTUALLY HE GOT THE TRUE TALE OUT OF BILBO AFTER MUCH QUESTIONING WHICH FOR A WHILE STRAINED THEIR FRIENDSHIP BUT THE WIZARD SEEMED TO THINK THE TRUTH IMPORTANT THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY SO TO BILBO HE ALSO THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT AND DISTURBING TO FIND THAT THE GOOD HOBBIT HAD NOT TOLD THE TRUTH FROM THE FIRST QUITE CONTRARY TO HIS HABIT THE IDEA OF A PRESENT WAS NOT MERE HOBBITLIKE INVENTION ALL THE SAME IT WAS SUGGESTED TO BILBO AS HE CONFESSED BY GOLLUMS TALK THAT HE OVERHEARD FOR GOLLUM DID IN FACT CALL THE RING HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT MANY TIMES THAT ALSO GANDALF THOUGHT STRANGE AND SUSPICIOUS BUT HE DID NOT DISCOVER THE TRUTH IN THIS POINT FOR MANY MORE YEARS AS WILL BE SEEN IN THIS BOOK
OF BILBOS LATER ADVENTURES LITTLE MORE NEED BE SAID HERE WITH THE HELP OF THE RING HE ESCAPED FROM THE ORCGUARDS AT THE GATE AND REJOINED HIS COMPANIONS HE USED THE RING MANY TIMES ON HIS QUEST CHIEFLY FOR THE HELP OF HIS FRIENDS BUT HE KEPT IT SECRET FROM THEM AS LONG AS HE COULD AFTER HIS RETURN TO HIS HOME HE NEVER SPOKE OF IT AGAIN TO ANYONE SAVE GANDALF AND FRODO AND NO ONE ELSE IN THE SHIRE KNEW OF ITS EXISTENCE OR SO HE BELIEVED ONLY TO FRODO DID HE SHOW THE ACCOUNT OF HIS JOURNEY THAT HE WAS WRITING
HIS SWORD STING BILBO HUNG OVER HIS FIREPLACE AND HIS COAT OF MARVELLOUS MAIL THE GIFT OF THE DWARVES FROM THE DRAGONHOARD HE LENT TO A MUSEUM TO THE MICHEL DELVING MATHOMHOUSE IN FACT BUT HE KEPT IN A DRAWER AT BAG END THE OLD CLOAK AND HOOD THAT HE HAD WORN ON HIS TRAVELS AND THE RING SECURED BY A FINE CHAIN REMAINED IN HIS POCKET
HE RETURNED TO HIS HOME AT BAG END ON JUNE THE 22ND IN HIS FIFTYSECOND YEAR SR 1342 AND NOTHING VERY NOTABLE OCCURRED IN THE SHIRE UNTIL MR BAGGINS BEGAN THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE CELEBRATION OF HIS HUNDREDANDELEVENTH BIRTHDAY SR 1401 AT THIS POINT THIS HISTORY BEGINS



NOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDS
AT THE END OF THE THIRD AGE THE PART PLAYED BY THE HOBBITS IN THE GREAT EVENTS THAT LED TO THE INCLUSION OF THE SHIRE IN THE REUNITED KINGDOM AWAKENED AMONG THEM A MORE WIDESPREAD INTEREST IN THEIR OWN HISTORY AND MANY OF THEIR TRADITIONS UP TO THAT TIME STILL MAINLY ORAL WERE COLLECTED AND WRITTEN DOWN THE GREATER FAMILIES WERE ALSO CONCERNED WITH EVENTS IN THE KINGDOM AT LARGE AND MANY OF THEIR MEMBERS STUDIED ITS ANCIENT HISTORIES AND LEGENDS BY THE END OF THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE FOURTH AGE THERE WERE ALREADY TO BE FOUND IN THE SHIRE SEVERAL LIBRARIES THAT CONTAINED MANY HISTORICAL BOOKS AND RECORDS
THE LARGEST OF THESE COLLECTIONS WERE PROBABLY AT UNDERTOWERS AT GREAT SMIALS AND AT BRANDY HALL THIS ACCOUNT OF THE END OF THE THIRD AGE IS DRAWN MAINLY FROM THE RED BOOK OF WESTMARCH THAT MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE FOR THE HISTORY OF THE WAR OF THE RING WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE IT WAS LONG PRESERVED AT UNDERTOWERS THE HOME OF THE FAIRBAIRNS WARDENS OF THE WESTMARCH3IT WAS IN ORIGIN BILBOS PRIVATE DIARY WHICH HE TOOK WITH HIM TO RIVENDELL FRODO BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE SHIRE TOGETHER WITH MANY LOOSE LEAVES OF NOTES AND DURING SR 14201 HE NEARLY FILLED ITS PAGES WITH HIS ACCOUNT OF THE WAR BUT ANNEXED TO IT AND PRESERVED WITH IT PROBABLYIN A SINGLE RED CASE WERE THE THREE LARGE VOLUMES BOUND IN RED LEATHER THAT BILBO GAVE TO HIM AS A PARTING GIFT TO THESE FOUR VOLUMES THERE WAS ADDED IN WESTMARCH A FIFTH CONTAINING COMMENTARIES GENEALOGIES AND VARIOUS OTHER MATTER CONCERNING THE HOBBIT MEMBERS OF THE FELLOWSHIP
THE ORIGINAL RED BOOK HAS NOT BEEN PRESERVED BUT MANY COPIES WERE MADE ESPECIALLY OF THE FIRST VOLUME FOR THE USE OF THE DESCENDANTS OF THE CHILDREN OF MASTER SAMWISE THE MOST IMPORTANT COPY HOWEVER HAS A DIFFERENT HISTORY IT WAS KEPT AT GREAT SMIALS BUT IT WAS WRITTEN IN CONDOR PROBABLY AT THE REQUEST OF THE GREATGRANDSON OF PEREGRIN AND COMPLETED IN SR 1592 FA 172 ITS SOUTHERN SCRIBE APPENDED THIS NOTE FINDEGIL KINGS WRITER FINISHED THIS WORK IN IV 172 IT IS AN EXACT COPY IN ALL DETAILS OF THE THAINS BOOKIN MINAS TIRITH THAT BOOK WAS A COPY MADE AT THE REQUEST OF KING ELESSAR OF THE RED BOOK OF THE PERIANNATH AND WAS BROUGHT TO HIM BY THE THAIN PEREGRIN WHEN HE RETIRED TO GONDOR IN IV 64
THE THAINS BOOK WAS THUS THE FIRST COPY MADE OF THE RED BOOK AND CONTAINED MUCH THAT WAS LATER OMITTED OR LOST IN MINAS TIRITH IT RECEIVED MUCH ANNOTATION AND MANY CORRECTIONS ESPECIALLY OF NAMES WORDS AND QUOTATIONS IN THE ELVISH LANGUAGES AND THERE WAS ADDED TO IT AN ABBREVIATED VERSION OF THOSE PARTS OF THE TALE OF ARAGORN AND ARWEN WHICH LIE OUTSIDE THE ACCOUNT OF THE WAR THE FULL TALE IS STATED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY BARAHIR GRANDSON OF THE STEWARD FARAMIR SOME TIME AFTER THE PASSING OF THE KING BUT THE CHIEF IMPORTANCE OF FINDEGILS COPY IS THAT IT ALONE CONTAINS THE WHOLE OF BILBOS TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ELVISH THESE THREE VOLUMES WERE FOUND TO BE A WORK OF GREAT SKILL AND LEARNING IN WHICH BETWEEN 1403 AND 1418 HE HAD USED ALL THE SOURCES AVAILABLE TO HIM IN RIVENDELL BOTH LIVING AND WRITTEN BUT SINCE THEY WERE LITTLE USED BY FRODO BEING ALMOST ENTIRELY CONCERNED WITH THE ELDER DAYS NO MORE IS SAID OF THEM HERE
SINCE MERIADOC AND PEREGRIN BECAME THE HEADS OF THEIR GREAT FAMILIES AND AT THE SAME TIME KEPT UP THEIR CONNEXIONS WITH ROHAN AND GONDOR THE LIBRARIES AT BUCKLEBURY AND TUCKBOROUGH CONTAINED MUCH THAT DID NOT APPEAR IN THE RED BOOK IN BRANDY HALL THERE WERE MANY WORKS DEALING WITH ERIADOR AND THE HISTORY OF ROHAN SOME OF THESE WERE COMPOSED OR BEGUN BY MERIADOC HIMSELF THOUGH IN THE SHIRE HE WAS CHIEFLY REMEMBERED FOR HIS HERBLORE OF THE SHIRE AND FOR HIS RECKONING OF YEARS M WHICH HE DISCUSSED THE RELATION OF THE CALENDARS OF THE SHIRE AND BREE TO THOSE OF RIVENDELL GONDOR AND ROHAN HE ALSO WROTE A SHORT TREATISE ON OLD WORDS AND NAMES IN THE SHIRE HAVING SPECIAL INTEREST IN DISCOVERING THE KINSHIP WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE ROHIRRIM OF SUCH SHIREWORDS AS MATHOM AND OLD ELEMENTS IN PLACE NAMES
AT GREAT SMIALS THE BOOKS WERE OF LESS INTEREST TO SHIREFOLK THOUGH MORE IMPORTANT FOR LARGER HISTORY NONE OF THEM WAS WRITTEN BY PEREGRIN BUT HE AND HIS SUCCESSORS COLLECTED MANY MANUSCRIPTS WRITTEN BY SCRIBES OF GONDOR MAINLY COPIES OR SUMMARIES OF HISTORIES OR LEGENDS RELATING TO ELENDIL AND HIS HEIRS ONLY HERE IN THE SHIRE WERE TO BE FOUND EXTENSIVE MATERIALS FOR THE HISTORY OF NUMENOR AND THE ARISING OF SAURON IT WAS PROBABLY AT GREAT SMIALS THAT THE TALE OF YEARS4WAS PUT TOGETHER WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MATERIAL COLLECTED BY MERIADOC THOUGH THE DATES GIVEN ARE OFTEN CONJECTURAL ESPECIALLY FOR THE SECOND AGE THEY DESERVE ATTENTION IT IS PROBABLE THAT MERIADOC OBTAINED ASSISTANCE AND INFORMATION FROM RIVENDELL WHICH HE VISITED MORE THAN ONCE THERE THOUGH ELROND HAD DEPARTED HIS SONS LONG REMAINED TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE HIGHELVEN FOLK IT IS SAID THAT CELEBORN WENT TO DWELL THERE AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF GALADRIEL BUT THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE DAY WHEN AT LAST HE SOUGHT THE GREY HAVENS AND WITH HIM WENT THE LAST LIVING MEMORY OF THE ELDER DAYS IN MIDDLEEARTH




BOOK I



CHAPTER 1
A LONGEXPECTED PARTY

WHEN MR BILBO BAGGINS OF BAG END ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD SHORTLY BE CELEBRATING HIS ELEVENTYFIRST BIRTHDAY WITH A PARTY OF SPECIAL MAGNIFICENCE THERE WAS MUCH TALK AND EXCITEMENT IN HOBBITON
BILBO WAS VERY RICH AND VERY PECULIAR AND HAD BEEN THE WONDER OF THE SHIRE FOR SIXTY YEARS EVER SINCE HIS REMARKABLE DISAPPEARANCE AND UNEXPECTED RETURN THE RICHES HE HAD BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS TRAVELS HAD NOW BECOME A LOCAL LEGEND AND IT WAS POPULARLY BELIEVED WHATEVER THE OLD FOLK MIGHT SAY THAT THE HILL AT BAG END WAS FULL OF TUNNELS STUFFED WITH TREASURE AND IF THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR FAME THERE WAS ALSO HIS PROLONGED VIGOUR TO MARVEL AT TIME WORE ON BUT IT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON MR BAGGINS AT NINETY HE WAS MUCH THE SAME AS AT FIFTY AT NINETYNINE THEY BEGAN TO CALL HIM WELLPRESERVED BUT UNCHANGED WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARER THE MARK THERE WERE SOME THAT SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND THOUGHT THIS WAS TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING IT SEEMED UNFAIR THAT ANYONE SHOULD POSSESS APPARENTLY PERPETUAL YOUTH AS WELL AS REPUTEDLY INEXHAUSTIBLE WEALTH
IT WILL HAVE TO BE PAID FOR THEY SAID IT ISNT NATURAL AND TROUBLE WILL COME OF IT
BUT SO FAR TROUBLE HAD NOT COME AND AS MR BAGGINS WAS GENEROUS WITH HIS MONEY MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO FORGIVE HIM HIS ODDITIES AND HIS GOOD FORTUNE HE REMAINED ON VISITING TERMS WITH HIS RELATIVES EXCEPT OF COURSE THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES AND HE HAD MANY DEVOTED ADMIRERS AMONG THE HOBBITS OF POOR AND UNIMPORTANT FAMILIES BUT HE HAD NO CLOSE FRIENDS UNTIL SOME OF HIS YOUNGER COUSINS BEGAN TO GROW UP
THE ELDEST OF THESE AND BILBOS FAVOURITE WAS YOUNG FRODO BAGGINS WHEN BILBO WAS NINETYNINE HE ADOPTED FRODO AS HIS HEIR AND BROUGHT HIM TO LIVE AT BAG END AND THE HOPES OF THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES WERE FINALLY DASHED BILBO AND FRODO HAPPENED TO HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY SEPTEMBER 22ND YOU HAD BETTER COME AND LIVE HERE FRODO MY LAD SAID BILBO ONE DAY AND THEN WE CAN CELEBRATE OUR BIRTHDAYPARTIES COMFORTABLY TOGETHER AT THAT TIME FRODO WAS STILL IN HIS TWEENS AS THE HOBBITS CALLED THE IRRESPONSIBLE TWENTIES BETWEEN CHILDHOOD AND COMING OF AGE AT THIRTYTHREE
TWELVE MORE YEARS PASSED EACH YEAR THE BAGGINSES HAD GIVEN VERY LIVELY COMBINED BIRTHDAYPARTIES AT BAG END BUT NOW IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT SOMETHING QUITE EXCEPTIONAL WAS BEING PLANNED FOR THAT AUTUMN BILBO WAS GOING TO BE ELEVENTYONE 111 A RATHER CURIOUS NUMBER AND A VERY RESPECTABLE AGE FOR A HOBBIT THE OLD TOOK HIMSELF HAD ONLY REACHED 130 AND FRODO WAS GOING TO BE THIRTYTHREE 33 AN IMPORTANT NUMBER THE DATE OF HIS COMING OF AGE
TONGUES BEGAN TO WAG IN HOBBITON AND BYWATER AND RUMOUR OF THE COMING EVENT TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE SHIRE THE HISTORY AND CHARACTER OF MR BILBO BAGGINS BECAME ONCE AGAIN THE CHIEF TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AND THE OLDER FOLK SUDDENLY FOUND THEIR REMINISCENCES IN WELCOME DEMAND
NO ONE HAD A MORE ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE THAN OLD HAM GAMGEE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE GAFFER HE HELD FORTH AT THE IVY BUSH A SMALL INN ON THE BYWATER ROAD AND HE SPOKE WITH SOME AUTHORITY FOR HE HAD TENDED THE GARDEN AT BAG END FOR FORTY YEARS AND HAD HELPED OLD HOLMAN IN THE SAME JOB BEFORE THAT NOW THAT HE WAS HIMSELF GROWING OLD AND STIFF IN THE JOINTS THE JOB WAS MAINLY CARRIED ON BY HIS YOUNGEST SON SAM GAMGEE BOTH FATHER AND SON WERE ON VERY FRIENDLY TERMS WITH BILBO AND FRODO THEY LIVED ON THE HILL ITSELF IN NUMBER 3 BAGSHOT ROW JUST BELOW BAG END
A VERY NICE WELLSPOKEN GENTLEHOBBIT IS MR BILBO AS IVE ALWAYS SAID THE GAFFER DECLARED WITH PERFECT TRUTH FOR BILBO WAS VERY POLITE TO HIM CALLING HIM MASTER HAMFAST AND CONSULTING HIM CONSTANTLY UPON THE GROWING OF VEGETABLES  IN THE MATTER OF ROOTS ESPECIALLY POTATOES THE GAFFER WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADING AUTHORITY BY ALL IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD INCLUDING HIMSELF
BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS FRODO THAT LIVES WITH HIM ASKED OLD NOAKES OF BYWATER BAGGINS IS HIS NAME BUT HES MORE THAN HALF A BRANDYBUCK THEY SAY IT BEATS ME WHY ANY BAGGINS OF HOBBITON SHOULD GO LOOKING FOR A WIFE AWAY THERE IN BUCKLAND WHERE FOLKS ARE SO QUEER
AND NO WONDER THEYRE QUEER PUT IN DADDY TWOFOOT THE GAFFERS NEXTDOOR NEIGHBOUR IF THEY LIVE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BRANDYWINE RIVER AND RIGHT AGIN THE OLD FOREST THATS A DARK BAD PLACE IF HALF THE TALES BE TRUE
YOURE RIGHT DAD SAID THE GAFFER NOT THAT THE BRANDYBUCKS OF BUCKLAND LIVE IN THE OLD FOREST BUT THEYRE A QUEER BREED SEEMINGLY THEY FOOL ABOUT WITH BOATS ON THAT BIG RIVER  AND THAT ISNT NATURAL SMALL WONDER THAT TROUBLE CAME OF IT I SAY BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY MR FRODO IS AS NICE A YOUNG HOBBIT AS YOU COULD WISH TO MEET VERY MUCH LIKE MR BILBO AND IN MORE THAN LOOKS AFTER ALL HIS FATHER WAS A BAGGINS A DECENT RESPECTABLE HOBBIT WAS MR DROGO BAGGINS THERE WAS NEVER MUCH TO TELL OF HIM TILL HE WAS DROWNDED
DROWNDED SAID SEVERAL VOICES THEY HAD HEARD THIS AND OTHER DARKER RUMOURS BEFORE OF COURSE BUT HOBBITS HAVE A PASSION FOR FAMILY HISTORY AND THEY WERE READY TO HEAR IT AGAIN WELL SO THEY SAY SAID THE GAFFER YOU SEE MR DROGO HE MARRIED POOR MISS PRIMULA BRANDYBUCK SHE WAS OUR MR BILBOS FIRST COUSIN ON THE MOTHERS SIDE HER MOTHER BEING THE YOUNGEST OF THE OLD TOOKS DAUGHTERS AND MR DROGO WAS HIS SECOND COUSIN SO MR FRODO IS HIS FIRST AND SECOND COUSIN ONCE REMOVED EITHER WAY AS THE SAYING IS IF YOU FOLLOW ME AND MR DROGO WAS STAYING AT BRANDY HALL WITH HIS FATHERINLAW OLD MASTER GORBADOC AS HE OFTEN DID AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HIM BEING PARTIAL TO HIS VITTLES AND OLD GORBADOC KEEPING A MIGHTY GENEROUS TABLE AND HE WENT OUT BOATING ON THE BRANDYWINE RIVER AND HE AND HIS WIFE WERE DROWNDED AND POOR MR FRODO ONLY A CHILD AND ALL 
IVE HEARD THEY WENT ON THE WATER AFTER DINNER IN THE MOONLIGHT SAID OLD NOAKES AND IT WAS DROGOS WEIGHT AS SUNK THE BOAT
AND I HEARD SHE PUSHED HIM IN AND HE PULLED HER IN AFTER HIM SAID SANDYMAN THE HOBBITON MILLER
YOU SHOULDNT LISTEN TO ALL YOU HEAR SANDYMAN SAID THE GAFFER WHO DID NOT MUCH LIKE THE MILLER THERE ISNT NO CALL TO GO TALKING OF PUSHING AND PULLING BOATS ARE QUITE TRICKY ENOUGH FOR THOSE THAT SIT STILL WITHOUT LOOKING FURTHER FOR THE CAUSE OF TROUBLE ANYWAY THERE WAS THIS MR FRODO LEFT AN ORPHAN AND STRANDED AS YOU MIGHT SAY AMONG THOSE QUEER BUCKLANDERS BEING BROUGHT UP ANYHOW IN BRANDY HALL A REGULAR WARREN BY ALL ACCOUNTS OLD MASTER GORBADOC NEVER HAD FEWER THAN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED RELATIONS IN THE PLACE MR BILBO NEVER DID A KINDER DEED THAN WHEN HE BROUGHT THE LAD BACK TO LIVE AMONG DECENT FOLK
BUT I RECKON IT WAS A NASTY SHOCK FOR THOSE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO GET BAG END THAT TIME WHEN HE WENT OFF AND WAS THOUGHT TO BE DEAD AND THEN HE COMES BACK AND ORDERS THEM OFF AND HE GOES ON LIVING AND LIVING AND NEVER LOOKING A DAY OLDER BLESS HIM AND SUDDENLY HE PRODUCES AN HEIR AND HAS ALL THE PAPERS MADE OUT PROPER THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES WONT NEVER SEE THE INSIDE OF BAG END NOW OR IT IS TO BE HOPED NOT

BUT THE GAFFER DID NOT CONVINCE HIS AUDIENCE THE LEGEND OF BILBOS WEALTH WAS NOW TOO FIRMLY FIXED IN THE MINDS OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF HOBBITS
AH BUT HE HAS LIKELY ENOUGH BEEN ADDING TO WHAT HE BROUGHT AT FIRST ARGUED THE MILLER VOICING COMMON OPINION HES OFTEN AWAY FROM HOME AND LOOK AT THE OUTLANDISH FOLK THAT VISIT HIM DWARVES COMING AT NIGHT AND THAT OLD WANDERING CONJUROR GANDALF AND ALL YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU LIKE GAFFER BUT BAG ENDS A QUEER PLACE AND ITS FOLK ARE QUEERER

THAT VERY MONTH WAS SEPTEMBER AND AS FINE AS YOU COULD ASK A DAY OR TWO LATER A RUMOUR PROBABLY STARTED BY THE KNOWLEDGEABLE SAM WAS SPREAD ABOUT THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE FIREWORKS  FIREWORKS WHAT IS MORE SUCH AS HAD NOT BEEN SEEN IN THE SHIRE FOR NIGH ON A CENTURY NOT INDEED SINCE THE OLD TOOK DIED
DAYS PASSED AND THE DAY DREW NEARER AN ODDLOOKING WAGGON LADEN WITH ODDLOOKING PACKAGES ROLLED INTO HOBBITON ONE EVENING AND TOILED UP THE HILL TO BAG END THE STARTLED HOBBITS PEERED OUT OF LAMPLIT DOORS TO GAPE AT IT IT WAS DRIVEN BY OUTLANDISH FOLK SINGING STRANGE SONGS DWARVES WITH LONG BEARDS AND DEEP HOODS A FEW OF THEM REMAINED AT BAG END AT THE END OF THE SECOND WEEK IN SEPTEMBER A CART CAME IN THROUGH BYWATER FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE BRANDYWINE BRIDGE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AN OLD MAN WAS DRIVING IT ALL ALONE HE WORE A TALL POINTED BLUE HAT A LONG GREY CLOAK AND A SILVER SCARF HE HAD A LONG WHITE BEARD AND BUSHY EYEBROWS THAT STUCK OUT BEYOND THE BRIM OF HIS HAT SMALL HOBBITCHILDREN RAN AFTER THE CART ALL THROUGH HOBBITON AND RIGHT UP THE HILL IT HAD A CARGO OF FIREWORKS AS THEY RIGHTLY GUESSED AT BILBOS FRONT DOOR THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO UNLOAD THERE WERE GREAT BUNDLES OF FIREWORKS OF ALL SORTS AND SHAPES EACH LABELLED WITH A LARGE RED G 
AND THE ELFRUNE 

THAT WAS GANDALFS MARK OF COURSE AND THE OLD MAN WAS GANDALF THE WIZARD WHOSE FAME IN THE SHIRE WAS DUE MAINLY TO HIS SKILL WITH FIRES SMOKES AND LIGHTS HIS REAL BUSINESS WAS FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS BUT THE SHIREFOLK KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT TO THEM HE WAS JUST ONE OF THE ATTRACTIONS AT THE PARTY HENCE THE EXCITEMENT OF THE HOBBITCHILDREN G FOR GRAND THEY SHOUTED AND THE OLD MAN SMILED THEY KNEW HIM BY SIGHT THOUGH HE ONLY APPEARED IN HOBBITON OCCASIONALLY AND NEVER STOPPED LONG BUT NEITHER THEY NOR ANY BUT THE OLDEST OF THEIR ELDERS HAD SEEN ONE OF HIS FIREWORK DISPLAYS  THEY NOW BELONGED TO THE LEGENDARY PAST
WHEN THE OLD MAN HELPED BY BILBO AND SOME DWARVES HAD FINISHED UNLOADING BILBO GAVE A FEW PENNIES AWAY BUT NOT A SINGLE SQUIB OR CRACKER WAS FORTHCOMING TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE ONLOOKERS
RUN AWAY NOW SAID GANDALF YOU WILL GET PLENTY WHEN THE TIME COMES THEN HE DISAPPEARED INSIDE WITH BILBO AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT THE YOUNG HOBBITS STARED AT THE DOOR IN VAIN FOR A WHILE AND THEN MADE OFF FEELING THAT THE DAY OF THE PARTY WOULD NEVER COME
INSIDE BAG END BILBO AND GANDALF WERE SITTING AT THE OPEN WINDOW OF A SMALL ROOM LOOKING OUT WEST ON TO THE GARDEN THE LATE AFTERNOON WAS BRIGHT AND PEACEFUL THE FLOWERS GLOWED RED AND GOLDEN SNAPDRAGONS AND SUNFLOWERS AND NASTURTIUMS TRAILING ALL OVER THE TURF WALLS AND PEEPING IN AT THE ROUND WINDOWS
HOW BRIGHT YOUR GARDEN LOOKS SAID GANDALF

WE SHALL SEE SAID BILBO
THE NEXT DAY MORE CARTS ROLLED UP THE HILL AND STILL MORE CARTS THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME GRUMBLING ABOUT DEALING LOCALLY BUT THAT VERY WEEK ORDERS BEGAN TO POUR OUT OF BAG END FOR EVERY KIND OF PROVISION COMMODITY OR LUXURY THAT COULD BE OBTAINED IN HOBBITON OR BYWATER OR ANYWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD PEOPLE BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC AND THEY BEGAN TO TICK OFF THE DAYS ON THE CALENDAR AND THEY WATCHED EAGERLY FOR THE POSTMAN HOPING FOR INVITATIONS
BEFORE LONG THE INVITATIONS BEGAN POURING OUT AND THE HOBBITON POSTOFFICE WAS BLOCKED AND THE BYWATER POSTOFFICE WAS SNOWED UNDER AND VOLUNTARY ASSISTANT POSTMEN WERE CALLED FOR THERE WAS A CONSTANT STREAM OF THEM GOING UP THE HILL CARRYING HUNDREDS OF POLITE VARIATIONS ON THANK YOU I SHALL CERTAINLY COME

ONE MORNING THE HOBBITS WOKE TO FIND THE LARGE FIELD SOUTH OF BILBOS FRONT DOOR COVERED WITH ROPES AND POLES FOR TENTS AND PAVILIONS A SPECIAL ENTRANCE WAS CUT INTO THE BANK LEADING TO THE ROAD AND WIDE STEPS AND A LARGE WHITE GATE WERE BUILT THERE THE THREE HOBBITFAMILIES OF BAGSHOT ROW ADJOINING THE FIELD WERE INTENSELY INTERESTED AND GENERALLY ENVIED OLD GAFFER GAMGEE STOPPED EVEN PRETENDING TO WORK IN HIS GARDEN
THE TENTS BEGAN TO GO UP THERE WAS A SPECIALLY LARGE PAVILION SO BIG THAT THE TREE THAT GREW IN THE FIELD WAS RIGHT INSIDE IT AND STOOD PROUDLY NEAR ONE END AT THE HEAD OF THE CHIEF TABLE LANTERNS WERE HUNG ON ALL ITS BRANCHES MORE PROMISING STILL TO THE HOBBITS MIND AN ENORMOUS OPENAIR KITCHEN WAS ERECTED IN THE NORTH CORNER OF THE FIELD A DRAUGHT OF COOKS FROM EVERY INN AND EATINGHOUSE FOR MILES AROUND ARRIVED TO SUPPLEMENT THE DWARVES AND OTHER ODD FOLK THAT WERE QUARTERED AT BAG END EXCITEMENT ROSE TO ITS HEIGHT
THEN THE WEATHER CLOUDED OVER THAT WAS ON WEDNESDAY THE EVE OF THE PARTY ANXIETY WAS INTENSE THEN THURSDAY SEPTEMBER THE 22ND ACTUALLY DAWNED THE SUN GOT UP THE CLOUDS VANISHED FLAGS WERE UNFURLED AND THE FUN BEGAN
BILBO BAGGINS CALLED IT A PARTY BUT IT WAS REALLY A VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENTS ROLLED INTO ONE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY LIVING NEAR WAS INVITED A VERY FEW WERE OVERLOOKED BY ACCIDENT BUT AS THEY TURNED UP ALL THE SAME THAT DID NOT MATTER MANY PEOPLE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE SHIRE WERE ALSO ASKED AND THERE WERE EVEN A FEW FROM OUTSIDE THE BORDERS BILBO MET THE GUESTS AND ADDITIONS AT THE NEW WHITE GATE IN PERSON HE GAVE AWAY PRESENTS TO ALL AND SUNDRY  THE LATTER WERE THOSE WHO WENT OUT AGAIN BY A BACK WAY AND CAME IN AGAIN BY THE GATE HOBBITS GIVE PRESENTS TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN BIRTHDAYS NOT VERY EXPENSIVE ONES AS A RULE AND NOT SO LAVISHLY AS ON THIS OCCASION BUT IT WAS NOT A BAD SYSTEM ACTUALLY IN HOBBITON AND BYWATER EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR IT WAS SOMEBODYS BIRTHDAY SO THAT EVERY HOBBIT IN THOSE PARTS HAD A FAIR CHANCE OF AT LEAST ONE PRESENT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK BUT THEY NEVER GOT TIRED OF THEM
ON THIS OCCASION THE PRESENTS WERE UNUSUALLY GOOD THE HOBBITCHILDREN WERE SO EXCITED THAT FOR A WHILE THEY ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT EATING THERE WERE TOYS THE LIKE OF WHICH THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE ALL BEAUTIFUL AND SOME OBVIOUSLY MAGICAL MANY OF THEM HAD INDEED BEEN ORDERED A YEAR BEFORE AND HAD COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND FROM DALE AND WERE OF REAL DWARFMAKE
WHEN EVERY GUEST HAD BEEN WELCOMED AND WAS FINALLY INSIDE THE GATE THERE WERE SONGS DANCES MUSIC GAMES AND OF COURSE FOOD AND DRINK THERE WERE THREE OFFICIAL MEALS LUNCH TEA AND DINNER OR SUPPER BUT LUNCH AND TEA WERE MARKED CHIEFLY BY THE FACT THAT AT THOSE TIMES ALL THE GUESTS WERE SITTING DOWN AND EATING TOGETHER AT OTHER TIMES THERE WERE MERELY LOTS OF PEOPLE EATING AND DRINKING  CONTINUOUSLY FROM ELEVENSES UNTIL SIXTHIRTY WHEN THE FIREWORKS STARTED
THE FIREWORKS WERE BY GANDALF THEY WERE NOT ONLY BROUGHT BY HIM BUT DESIGNED AND MADE BY HIM AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS SET PIECES AND FLIGHTS OF ROCKETS WERE LET OFF BY HIM BUT THERE WAS ALSO A GENEROUS DISTRIBUTION OF SQUIBS CRACKERS BACKARAPPERS SPARKLERS TORCHES DWARFCANDLES ELFFOUNTAINS GOBLINBARKERS AND THUNDERCLAPS THEY WERE ALL SUPERB THE ART OF GANDALF IMPROVED WITH AGE
THERE WERE ROCKETS LIKE A FLIGHT OF SCINTILLATING BIRDS SINGING WITH SWEET VOICES THERE WERE GREEN TREES WITH TRUNKS OF DARK SMOKE THEIR LEAVES OPENED LIKE A WHOLE SPRING UNFOLDING IN A MOMENT AND THEIR SHINING BRANCHES DROPPED GLOWING FLOWERS DOWN UPON THE ASTONISHED HOBBITS DISAPPEARING WITH A SWEET SCENT JUST BEFORE THEY TOUCHED THEIR UPTURNED FACES THERE WERE FOUNTAINS OF BUTTERFLIES THAT FLEW GLITTERING INTO THE TREES THERE WERE PILLARS OF COLOURED FIRES THAT ROSE AND TURNED INTO EAGLES OR SAILING SHIPS OR A PHALANX OF FLYING SWANS THERE WAS A RED THUNDERSTORM AND A SHOWER OF YELLOW RAIN THERE WAS A FOREST OF SILVER SPEARS THAT SPRANG SUDDENLY INTO THE AIR WITH A YELL LIKE AN EMBATTLED ARMY AND CAME DOWN AGAIN INTO THE WATER WITH A HISS LIKE A HUNDRED HOT SNAKES AND THERE WAS ALSO ONE LAST SURPRISE IN HONOUR OF BILBO AND IT STARTLED THE HOBBITS EXCEEDINGLY AS GANDALF INTENDED THE LIGHTS WENT OUT A GREAT SMOKE WENT UP IT SHAPED ITSELF LIKE A MOUNTAIN SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND BEGAN TO GLOW AT THE SUMMIT IT SPOUTED GREEN AND SCARLET FLAMES OUT FLEW A REDGOLDEN DRAGON  NOT LIFESIZE BUT TERRIBLY LIFELIKE FIRE CAME FROM HIS JAWS HIS EYES GLARED DOWN THERE WAS A ROAR AND HE WHIZZED THREE TIMES OVER THE HEADS OF THE CROWD THEY ALL DUCKED AND MANY FELL FLAT ON THEIR FACES THE DRAGON PASSED LIKE AN EXPRESS TRAIN TURNED A SOMERSAULT AND BURST OVER BYWATER WITH A DEAFENING EXPLOSION

THEY WENT OUT INTO THE HALL BILBO CHOSE HIS FAVOURITE STICK FROM THE STAND THEN HE WHISTLED THREE DWARVES CAME OUT OF DIFFERENT ROOMS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BUSY
IS EVERYTHING READY ASKED BILBO EVERYTHING PACKED AND LABELLED
EVERYTHING THEY ANSWERED
WELL LETS START THEN HE STEPPED OUT OF THE FRONTDOOR
IT WAS A FINE NIGHT AND THE BLACK SKY WAS DOTTED WITH STARS HE LOOKED UP SNIFFING THE AIR WHAT FUN WHAT FUN TO BE OFF AGAIN OFF ON THE ROAD WITH DWARVES THIS IS WHAT I HAVE REALLY BEEN LONGING FOR FOR YEARS GOODBYE  HE SAID LOOKING AT HIS OLD HOME AND BOWING TO THE DOOR GOODBYE GANDALF

TAKE CARE I DONT CARE DONT YOU WORRY ABOUT ME I AM AS HAPPY NOW AS I HAVE EVER BEEN AND THAT IS SAYING A GREAT DEAL BUT THE TIME HAS COME I AM BEING SWEPT OFF MY FEET AT LAST HE ADDED AND THEN IN A LOW VOICE AS IF TO HIMSELF HE SANG SOFTLY IN THE DARK
THE ROAD GOES EVER ON AND ON
DOWN FROM THE DOOR WHERE IT BEGAN
NOW FAR AHEAD THE ROAD HAS GONE
AND I MUST FOLLOW IF I CAN
PURSUING IT WITH EAGER FEET
UNTIL IT JOINS SOME LARGER WAY
WHERE MANY PATHS AND ERRANDS MEET
AND WHITHER THEN I CANNOT SAY

HE PAUSED SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE LIGHTS AND VOICES IN THE FIELDS AND TENTS AND FOLLOWED BY HIS THREE COMPANIONS WENT ROUND INTO HIS GARDEN AND TROTTED DOWN THE LONG SLOPING PATH HE JUMPED OVER A LOW PLACE IN THE HEDGE AT THE BOTTOM AND TOOK TO THE MEADOWS PASSING INTO THE NIGHT LIKE A RUSTLE OF WIND IN THE GRASS
GANDALF REMAINED FOR A WHILE STARING AFTER HIM INTO THE DARKNESS GOODBYE MY DEAR BILBO  UNTIL OUR NEXT MEETING HE SAID SOFTLY AND WENT BACK INDOORS
FRODO CAME IN SOON AFTERWARDS AND FOUND HIM SITTING IN THE DARK DEEP IN THOUGHT HAS HE GONE HE ASKED
YES ANSWERED GANDALF HE HAS GONE AT LAST
I WISH  I MEAN I HOPED UNTIL THIS EVENING THAT IT WAS ONLY A JOKE SAID FRODO BUT I KNEW IN MY HEART THAT HE REALLY MEANT TO GO HE ALWAYS USED TO JOKE ABOUT SERIOUS THINGS I WISH I HAD COME BACK SOONER JUST TO SEE HIM OFF
I THINK REALLY HE PREFERRED SLIPPING OFF QUIETLY IN THE END SAID GANDALF DONT BE TOO TROUBLED HELL BE ALL RIGHT  NOW HE LEFT A PACKET FOR YOU THERE IT IS
FRODO TOOK THE ENVELOPE FROM THE MANTELPIECE AND GLANCED AT IT BUT DID NOT OPEN IT

THE RING EXCLAIMED FRODO HAS HE LEFT ME THAT I WONDER WHY STILL IT MAY BE USEFUL
IT MAY AND IT MAY NOT SAID GANDALF I SHOULD NOT MAKE USE OF IT IF I WERE YOU BUT KEEP IT SECRET AND KEEP IT SAFE NOW I AM GOING TO BED
AS MASTER OF BAG END FRODO FELT IT HIS PAINFUL DUTY TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE GUESTS RUMOURS OF STRANGE EVENTS HAD BY NOW SPREAD ALL OVER THE FIELD BUT FRODO WOULD ONLY SAY NO DOUBT EVERYTHING WILL BE CLEARED UP IN THE MORNING ABOUT MIDNIGHT CARRIAGES CAME FOR THE IMPORTANT FOLK ONE BY ONE THEY ROLLED AWAY FILLED WITH FULL BUT VERY UNSATISFIED HOBBITS GARDENERS CAME BY ARRANGEMENT AND REMOVED IN WHEELBARROWS THOSE THAT HAD INADVERTENTLY REMAINED BEHIND
NIGHT SLOWLY PASSED THE SUN ROSE THE HOBBITS ROSE RATHER LATER MORNING WENT ON PEOPLE CAME AND BEGAN BY ORDERS TO CLEAR AWAY THE PAVILIONS AND THE TABLES AND THE CHAIRS AND THE SPOONS AND KNIVES AND BOTTLES AND PLATES AND THE LANTERNS AND THE FLOWERING SHRUBS IN BOXES AND THE CRUMBS AND CRACKERPAPER THE FORGOTTEN BAGS AND GLOVES AND HANDKERCHIEFS AND THE UNEATEN FOOD A VERY SMALL ITEM THEN A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE CAME WITHOUT ORDERS BAGGINSES AND BOFFINS AND BOLGERS AND TOOKS AND OTHER GUESTS THAT LIVED OR WERE STAYING NEAR BY MIDDAY WHEN EVEN THE BESTFED WERE OUT AND ABOUT AGAIN THERE WAS A LARGE CROWD AT BAG END UNINVITED BUT NOT UNEXPECTED
FRODO WAS WAITING ON THE STEP SMILING BUT LOOKING RATHER TIRED AND WORRIED HE WELCOMED ALL THE CALLERS BUT HE HAD NOT MUCH MORE TO SAY THAN BEFORE HIS REPLY TO ALL INQUIRIES WAS SIMPLY THIS MR BILBO BAGGINS HAS GONE AWAY AS FAR AS I KNOW FOR GOOD SOME OF THE VISITORS HE INVITED TO COME INSIDE AS BILBO HAD LEFT MESSAGES FOR THEM
INSIDE IN THE HALL THERE WAS PILED A LARGE ASSORTMENT OF PACKAGES AND PARCELS AND SMALL ARTICLES OF FURNITURE ON EVERY ITEM THERE WAS A LABEL TIED THERE WERE SEVERAL LABELS OF THIS SORT
FOR ADELARD TOOK FOR HIS VERY OWN FROM BILBO ON AN UMBRELLA ADELARD HAD CARRIED OFF MANY UNLABELLED ONES

THIS IS ONLY A SMALL SELECTION OF THE ASSEMBLED PRESENTS BILBOS RESIDENCE HAD GOT RATHER CLUTTERED UP WITH THINGS IN THE COURSE OF HIS LONG LIFE IT WAS A TENDENCY OF HOBBITHOLES TO GET CLUTTERED UP FOR WHICH THE CUSTOM OF GIVING SO MANY BIRTHDAYPRESENTS WAS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE NOT OF COURSE THAT THE BIRTHDAYPRESENTS WERE ALWAYS NEW THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OLD MATHOMS OF FORGOTTEN USES THAT HAD CIRCULATED ALL AROUND THE DISTRICT BUT BILBO HAD USUALLY GIVEN NEW PRESENTS AND KEPT THOSE THAT HE RECEIVED THE OLD HOLE WAS NOW BEING CLEARED A LITTLE
EVERY ONE OF THE VARIOUS PARTING GIFTS HAD LABELS WRITTEN OUT PERSONALLY BY BILBO AND SEVERAL HAD SOME POINT OR SOME JOKE BUT OF COURSE MOST OF THE THINGS WERE GIVEN WHERE THEY WOULD BE WANTED AND WELCOME THE POORER HOBBITS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE OF BAGSHOT ROW DID VERY WELL OLD GAFFER GAMGEE GOT TWO SACKS OF POTATOES A NEW SPADE A WOOLLEN WAISTCOAT AND A BOTTLE OF OINTMENT FOR CREAKING JOINTS OLD RORY BRANDYBUCK IN RETURN FOR MUCH HOSPITALITY GOT A DOZEN BOTTLES OF OLD WINYARDS A STRONG RED WINE FROM THE SOUTHFARTHING AND NOW QUITE MATURE AS IT HAD BEEN LAID DOWN BY BILBOS FATHER RORY QUITE FORGAVE BILBO AND VOTED HIM A CAPITAL FELLOW AFTER THE FIRST BOTTLE
THERE WAS PLENTY OF EVERYTHING LEFT FOR FRODO AND OF COURSE ALL THE CHIEF TREASURES AS WELL AS THE BOOKS PICTURES AND MORE THAN ENOUGH FURNITURE WERE LEFT IN HIS POSSESSION THERE WAS HOWEVER NO SIGN NOR MENTION OF MONEY OR JEWELLERY NOT A PENNYPIECE OR A GLASS BEAD WAS GIVEN AWAY
FRODO HAD A VERY TRYING TIME THAT AFTERNOON A FALSE RUMOUR THAT THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WAS BEING DISTRIBUTED FREE SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE AND BEFORE LONG THE PLACE WAS PACKED WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD NO BUSINESS THERE BUT COULD NOT BE KEPT OUT LABELS GOT TORN OFF AND MIXED AND QUARRELS BROKE OUT SOME PEOPLE TRIED TO DO SWAPS AND DEALS IN THE HALL AND OTHERS TRIED TO MAKE OFF WITH MINOR ITEMS NOT ADDRESSED TO THEM OR WITH ANYTHING THAT SEEMED UNWANTED OR UNWATCHED THE ROAD TO THE GATE WAS BLOCKED WITH BARROWS AND HANDCARTS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COMMOTION THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES ARRIVED FRODO HAD RETIRED FOR A WHILE AND LEFT HIS FRIEND MERRY BRANDYBUCK TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS WHEN OTHO LOUDLY DEMANDED TO SEE FRODO MERRY BOWED POLITELY
HE IS INDISPOSED HE SAID HE IS RESTING
HIDING YOU MEAN SAID LOBELIA ANYWAY WE WANT TO SEE HIM AND WE MEAN TO SEE HIM JUST GO AND TELL HIM SO
MERRY LEFT THEM A LONG WHILE IN THE HALL AND THEY HAD TIME TO DISCOVER THEIR PARTING GIFT OF SPOONS IT DID NOT IMPROVE THEIR TEMPERS EVENTUALLY THEY WERE SHOWN INTO THE STUDY FRODO WAS SITTING AT A TABLE WITH A LOT OF PAPERS IN FRONT OF HIM HE LOOKED INDISPOSED  TO SEE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES AT ANY RATE AND HE STOOD UP FIDGETING WITH SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET BUT HE SPOKE QUITE POLITELY
THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES WERE RATHER OFFENSIVE THEY BEGAN BY OFFERING HIM BAD BARGAINPRICES AS BETWEEN FRIENDS FOR VARIOUS VALUABLE AND UNLABELLED THINGS WHEN FRODO REPLIED THAT ONLY THE THINGS SPECIALLY DIRECTED BY BILBO WERE BEING GIVEN AWAY THEY SAID THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS VERY FISHY
ONLY ONE THING IS CLEAR TO ME SAID OTHO AND THAT IS THAT YOU ARE DOING EXCEEDINGLY WELL OUT OF IT I INSIST ON SEEING THE WILL
OTHO WOULD HAVE BEEN BILBOS HEIR BUT FOR THE ADOPTION OF FRODO HE READ THE WILL CAREFULLY AND SNORTED IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY VERY CLEAR AND CORRECT ACCORDING TO THE LEGAL CUSTOMS OF HOBBITS WHICH DEMAND AMONG OTHER THINGS SEVEN SIGNATURES OF WITNESSES IN RED INK
FOILED AGAIN HE SAID TO HIS WIFE AND AFTER WAITING SIXTY YEARS SPOONS FIDDLESTICKS HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS UNDER FRODOS NOSE AND SLUMPED OFF BUT LOBELIA WAS NOT SO EASILY GOT RID OF A LITTLE LATER FRODO CAME OUT OF THE STUDY TO SEE HOW THINGS WERE GOING ON AND FOUND HER STILL ABOUT THE PLACE INVESTIGATING NOOKS AND CORNERS AND TAPPING THE FLOORS HE ESCORTED HER FIRMLY OFF THE PREMISES AFTER HE HAD RELIEVED HER OF SEVERAL SMALL BUT RATHER VALUABLE ARTICLES THAT HAD SOMEHOW FALLEN INSIDE HER UMBRELLA HER FACE LOOKED AS IF SHE WAS IN THE THROES OF THINKING OUT A REALLY CRUSHING PARTING REMARK BUT ALL SHE FOUND TO SAY TURNING ROUND ON THE STEP WAS
YOULL LIVE TO REGRET IT YOUNG FELLOW WHY DIDNT YOU GO TOO YOU DONT BELONG HERE YOURE NO BAGGINS  YOU  YOURE A BRANDYBUCK
DID YOU HEAR THAT MERRY THAT WAS AN INSULT IF YOU LIKE SAID FRODO AS HE SHUT THE DOOR ON HER
IT WAS A COMPLIMENT SAID MERRY BRANDYBUCK AND SO OF COURSE NOT TRUE
THEN THEY WENT ROUND THE HOLE AND EVICTED THREE YOUNG HOBBITS TWO BOFFINS AND A BOLGER WHO WERE KNOCKING HOLES IN THE WALLS OF ONE OF THE CELLARS FRODO ALSO HAD A TUSSLE WITH YOUNG SANCHO PROUDFOOT OLD ODO PROUDFOOTS GRANDSON WHO HAD BEGUN AN EXCAVATION IN THE LARGER PANTRY WHERE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ECHO THE LEGEND OF BILBOS GOLD EXCITED BOTH CURIOSITY AND HOPE FOR LEGENDARY GOLD MYSTERIOUSLY OBTAINED IF NOT POSITIVELY ILLGOTTEN IS AS EVERY ONE KNOWS ANY ONES FOR THE FINDING  UNLESS THE SEARCH IS INTERRUPTED
WHEN HE HAD OVERCOME SANCHO AND PUSHED HIM OUT FRODO COLLAPSED ON A CHAIR IN THE HALL ITS TIME TO CLOSE THE SHOP MERRY HE SAID LOCK THE DOOR AND DONT OPEN IT TO ANYONE TODAY NOT EVEN IF THEY BRING A BATTERING RAM THEN HE WENT TO REVIVE HIMSELF WITH A BELATED CUP OF TEA
HE HAD HARDLY SAT DOWN WHEN THERE CAME A SOFT KNOCK AT THE FRONTDOOR LOBELIA AGAIN MOST LIKELY HE THOUGHT SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING REALLY NASTY AND HAVE COME BACK AGAIN TO SAY IT IT CAN WAIT
HE WENT ON WITH HIS TEA THE KNOCK WAS REPEATED MUCH LOUDER BUT HE TOOK NO NOTICE SUDDENLY THE WIZARDS HEAD APPEARED AT THE WINDOW
IF YOU DONT LET ME IN FRODO I SHALL BLOW YOUR DOOR RIGHT DOWN YOUR HOLE AND OUT THROUGH THE HILL HE SAID
MY DEAR GANDALF HALF A MINUTE CRIED FRODO RUNNING OUT OF THE ROOM TO THE DOOR COME IN COME IN I THOUGHT IT WAS LOBELIA
THEN I FORGIVE YOU BUT I SAW HER SOME TIME AGO DRIVING A PONYTRAP TOWARDS BYWATER WITH A FACE THAT WOULD HAVE CURDLED NEW MILK
SHE HAD ALREADY NEARLY CURDLED ME HONESTLY I NEARLY TRIED ON BILBOS RING I LONGED TO DISAPPEAR
DONT DO THAT SAID GANDALF SITTING DOWN DO BE CAREFUL OF THAT RING FRODO IN FACT IT IS PARTLY ABOUT THAT THAT I HAVE COME TO SAY A LAST WORD
WELL WHAT ABOUT IT
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ALREADY
ONLY WHAT BILBO TOLD ME I HAVE HEARD HIS STORY HOW HE FOUND IT AND HOW HE USED IT ON HIS JOURNEY I MEAN
WHICH STORY I WONDER SAID GANDALF
OH NOT WHAT HE TOLD THE DWARVES AND PUT IN HIS BOOK SAID FRODO HE TOLD ME THE TRUE STORY SOON AFTER I CAME TO LIVE HERE HE SAID YOU HAD PESTERED HIM TILL HE TOLD YOU SO I HAD BETTER KNOW TOO NO SECRETS BETWEEN US FRODO HE SAID BUT THEY ARE NOT TO GO ANY FURTHER ITS MINE ANYWAY
THATS INTERESTING SAID GANDALF WELL WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT ALL
IF YOU MEAN INVENTING ALL THAT ABOUT A PRESENT WELL I THOUGHT THE TRUE STORY MUCH MORE LIKELY AND I COULDNT SEE THE POINT OF ALTERING IT AT ALL IT WAS VERY UNLIKE BILBO TO DO SO ANYWAY AND I THOUGHT IT RATHER ODD
SO DID I BUT ODD THINGS MAY HAPPEN TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUCH TREASURES  IF THEY USE THEM LET IT BE A WARNING TO YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH IT IT MAY HAVE OTHER POWERS THAN JUST MAKING YOU VANISH WHEN YOU WISH TO
I DONT UNDERSTAND SAID FRODO
NEITHER DO I ANSWERED THE WIZARD I HAVE MERELY BEGUN TO WONDER ABOUT THE RING ESPECIALLY SINCE LAST NIGHT NO NEED TO WORRY BUT IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL USE IT VERY SELDOM OR NOT AT ALL AT LEAST I BEG YOU NOT TO USE IT IN ANY WAY THAT WILL CAUSE TALK OR ROUSE SUSPICION I SAY AGAIN KEEP IT SAFE AND KEEP IT SECRET
YOU ARE VERY MYSTERIOUS WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF
I AM NOT CERTAIN SO I WILL SAY NO MORE I MAY BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING WHEN I COME BACK I AM GOING OFF AT ONCE SO THIS IS GOODBYE FOR THE PRESENT HE GOT UP
AT ONCE CRIED FRODO WHY I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAYING ON FOR AT LEAST A WEEK I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR HELP
I DID MEAN TO  BUT I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY MIND I MAY BE AWAY FOR A GOOD WHILE BUT ILL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN AS SOON AS I CAN EXPECT ME WHEN YOU SEE ME I SHALL SLIP IN QUIETLY I SHANT OFTEN BE VISITING THE SHIRE OPENLY AGAIN I FIND THAT I HAVE BECOME RATHER UNPOPULAR THEY SAY I AM A NUISANCE AND A DISTURBER OF THE PEACE SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ACCUSING ME OF SPIRITING BILBO AWAY OR WORSE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PLOT BETWEEN YOU AND ME TO GET HOLD OF HIS WEALTH
SOME PEOPLE EXCLAIMED FRODO YOU MEAN OTHO AND LOBELIA HOW ABOMINABLE I WOULD GIVE THEM BAG END AND EVERYTHING ELSE IF I COULD GET BILBO BACK AND GO OFF TRAMPING IN THE COUNTRY WITH HIM I LOVE THE SHIRE BUT I BEGIN TO WISH SOMEHOW THAT I HAD GONE TOO I WONDER IF I SHALL EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
SO DO I SAID GANDALF AND I WONDER MANY OTHER THINGS GOODBYE NOW TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF LOOK OUT FOR ME ESPECIALLY AT UNLIKELY TIMES GOODBYE
FRODO SAW HIM TO THE DOOR HE GAVE A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND AND WALKED OFF AT A SURPRISING PACE BUT FRODO THOUGHT THE OLD WIZARD LOOKED UNUSUALLY BENT ALMOST AS IF HE WAS CARRYING A GREAT WEIGHT THE EVENING WAS CLOSING IN AND HIS CLOAKED FIGURE QUICKLY VANISHED INTO THE TWILIGHT FRODO DID NOT SEE HIM AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME



CHAPTER 2
THE SHADOW OF THE PAST

THE TALK DID NOT DIE DOWN IN NINE OR EVEN NINETYNINE DAYS THE SECOND DISAPPEARANCE OF MR BILBO BAGGINS WAS DISCUSSED IN HOBBITON AND INDEED ALL OVER THE SHIRE FOR A YEAR AND A DAY AND WAS REMEMBERED MUCH LONGER THAN THAT IT BECAME A FIRESIDESTORY FOR YOUNG HOBBITS AND EVENTUALLY MAD BAGGINS WHO USED TO VANISH WITH A BANG AND A FLASH AND REAPPEAR WITH BAGS OF JEWELS AND GOLD BECAME A FAVOURITE CHARACTER OF LEGEND AND LIVED ON LONG AFTER ALL THE TRUE EVENTS WERE FORGOTTEN
BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE GENERAL OPINION IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS THAT BILBO WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN RATHER CRACKED HAD AT LAST GONE QUITE MAD AND HAD RUN OFF INTO THE BLUE THERE HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FALLEN INTO A POOL OR A RIVER AND COME TO A TRAGIC BUT HARDLY AN UNTIMELY END THE BLAME WAS MOSTLY LAID ON GANDALF
IF ONLY THAT DRATTED WIZARD WILL LEAVE YOUNG FRODO ALONE PERHAPS HELL SETTLE DOWN AND GROW SOME HOBBITSENSE THEY SAID AND TO ALL APPEARANCE THE WIZARD DID LEAVE FRODO ALONE AND HE DID SETTLE DOWN BUT THE GROWTH OF HOBBITSENSE WAS NOT VERY NOTICEABLE INDEED HE AT ONCE BEGAN TO CARRY ON BILBOS REPUTATION FOR ODDITY HE REFUSED TO GO INTO MOURNING AND THE NEXT YEAR HE GAVE A PARTY IN HONOUR OF BILBOS HUNDREDANDTWELFTH BIRTHDAY WHICH HE CALLED HUNDREDWEIGHT FEAST BUT THAT WAS SHORT OF THE MARK FOR TWENTY GUESTS WERE INVITED AND THERE WERE SEVERAL MEALS AT WHICH IT SNOWED FOOD AND RAINED DRINK AS HOBBITS SAY
SOME PEOPLE WERE RATHER SHOCKED BUT FRODO KEPT UP THE CUSTOM OF GIVING BILBOS BIRTHDAY PARTY YEAR AFTER YEAR UNTIL THEY GOT USED TO IT HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK BILBO WAS DEAD WHEN THEY ASKED WHERE IS HE THEN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
HE LIVED ALONE AS BILBO HAD DONE BUT HE HAD A GOOD MANY FRIENDS ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNGER HOBBITS MOSTLY DESCENDANTS OF THE OLD TOOK WHO HAD AS CHILDREN BEEN FOND OF BILBO AND OFTEN IN AND OUT OF BAG END FOLCO BOFFIN AND FREDEGAR BOLGER WERE TWO OF THESE BUT HIS CLOSEST FRIENDS WERE PEREGRIN TOOK USUALLY CALLED PIPPIN AND MERRY BRANDYBUCK HIS REAL NAME WAS MERIADOC BUT THAT WAS SELDOM REMEMBERED FRODO WENT TRAMPING ALL OVER THE SHIRE WITH THEM BUT MORE OFTEN HE WANDERED BY HIMSELF AND TO THE AMAZEMENT OF SENSIBLE FOLK HE WAS SOMETIMES SEEN FAR FROM HOME WALKING IN THE HILLS AND WOODS UNDER THE STARLIGHT MERRY AND PIPPIN SUSPECTED THAT HE VISITED THE ELVES AT TIMES AS BILBO HAD DONE
AS TIME WENT ON PEOPLE BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT FRODO ALSO SHOWED SIGNS OF GOOD PRESERVATION OUTWARDLY HE RETAINED THE APPEARANCE OF A ROBUST AND ENERGETIC HOBBIT JUST OUT OF HIS TWEENS SOME FOLK HAVE ALL THE LUCK THEY SAID BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL FRODO APPROACHED THE USUALLY MORE SOBER AGE OF FIFTY THAT THEY BEGAN TO THINK IT QUEER
FRODO HIMSELF AFTER THE FIRST SHOCK FOUND THAT BEING HIS OWN MASTER AND THE MR BAGGINS OF BAG END WAS RATHER PLEASANT FOR SOME YEARS HE WAS QUITE HAPPY AND DID NOT WORRY MUCH ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT HALF UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF THE REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT GONE WITH BILBO WAS STEADILY GROWING HE FOUND HIMSELF WONDERING AT TIMES ESPECIALLY IN THE AUTUMN ABOUT THE WILD LANDS AND STRANGE VISIONS OF MOUNTAINS THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN CAME INTO HIS DREAMS HE BEGAN TO SAY TO HIMSELF PERHAPS I SHALL CROSS THE RIVER MYSELF ONE DAY TO WHICH THE OTHER HALF OF HIS MIND ALWAYS REPLIED NOT YET
SO IT WENT ON UNTIL HIS FORTIES WERE RUNNING OUT AND HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY WAS DRAWING NEAR FIFTY WAS A NUMBER THAT HE FELT WAS SOMEHOW SIGNIFICANT OR OMINOUS IT WAS AT ANY RATE AT THAT AGE THAT ADVENTURE HAD SUDDENLY BEFALLEN BILBO FRODO BEGAN TO FEEL RESTLESS AND THE OLD PATHS SEEMED TOO WELLTRODDEN HE LOOKED AT MAPS AND WONDERED WHAT LAY BEYOND THEIR EDGES MAPS MADE IN THE SHIRE SHOWED MOSTLY WHITE SPACES BEYOND ITS BORDERS HE TOOK TO WANDERING FURTHER AFIELD AND MORE OFTEN BY HIMSELF AND MERRY AND HIS OTHER FRIENDS WATCHED HIM ANXIOUSLY OFTEN HE WAS SEEN WALKING AND TALKING WITH THE STRANGE WAYFARERS THAT BEGAN AT THIS TIME TO APPEAR IN THE SHIRE
THERE WERE RUMOURS OF STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE AND AS GANDALF HAD NOT AT THAT TIME APPEARED OR SENT ANY MESSAGE FOR SEVERAL YEARS FRODO GATHERED ALL THE NEWS HE COULD ELVES WHO SELDOM WALKED IN THE SHIRE COULD NOW BE SEEN PASSING WESTWARD THROUGH THE WOODS IN THE EVENING PASSING AND NOT RETURNING BUT THEY WERE LEAVING MIDDLEEARTH AND WERE NO LONGER CONCERNED WITH ITS TROUBLES THERE WERE HOWEVER DWARVES ON THE ROAD IN UNUSUAL NUMBERS THE ANCIENT EASTWEST ROAD RAN THROUGH THE SHIRE TO ITS END AT THE GREY HAVENS AND DWARVES HAD ALWAYS USED IT ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR MINES IN THE BLUE MOUNTAINS THEY WERE THE HOBBITS CHIEF SOURCE OF NEWS FROM DISTANT PARTS  IF THEY WANTED ANY AS A RULE DWARVES SAID LITTLE AND HOBBITS ASKED NO MORE BUT NOW FRODO OFTEN MET STRANGE DWARVES OF FAR COUNTRIES SEEKING REFUGE IN THE WEST THEY WERE TROUBLED AND SOME SPOKE IN WHISPERS OF THE ENEMY AND OF THE LAND OF MORDOR
THAT NAME THE HOBBITS ONLY KNEW IN LEGENDS OF THE DARK PAST LIKE A SHADOW IN THE BACKGROUND OF THEIR MEMORIES BUT IT WAS OMINOUS AND DISQUIETING IT SEEMED THAT THE EVIL POWER IN MIRKWOOD HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT BY THE WHITE COUNCIL ONLY TO REAPPEAR IN GREATER STRENGTH IN THE OLD STRONGHOLDS OF MORDOR THE DARK TOWER HAD BEEN REBUILT IT WAS SAID FROM THERE THE POWER WAS SPREADING FAR AND WIDE AND AWAY FAR EAST AND SOUTH THERE WERE WARS AND GROWING FEAR ORCS WERE MULTIPLYING AGAIN IN THE MOUNTAINS TROLLS WERE ABROAD NO LONGER DULLWITTED BUT CUNNING AND ARMED WITH DREADFUL WEAPONS AND THERE WERE MURMURED HINTS OF CREATURES MORE TERRIBLE THAN ALL THESE BUT THEY HAD NO NAME
LITTLE OF ALL THIS OF COURSE REACHED THE EARS OF ORDINARY HOBBITS BUT EVEN THE DEAFEST AND MOST STAYATHOME BEGAN TO HEAR QUEER TALES AND THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS TOOK THEM TO THE BORDERS SAW STRANGE THINGS THE CONVERSATION IN THE GREEN DRAGON AT BYWATER ONE EVENING IN THE SPRING OF FRODOS FIFTIETH YEAR SHOWED THAT EVEN IN THE COMFORTABLE HEART OF THE SHIRE RUMOURS HAD BEEN HEARD THOUGH MOST HOBBITS STILL LAUGHED AT THEM
SAM GAMGEE WAS SITTING IN ONE CORNER NEAR THE FIRE AND OPPOSITE HIM WAS TED SANDYMAN THE MILLERS SON AND THERE WERE VARIOUS OTHER RUSTIC HOBBITS LISTENING TO THEIR TALK
QUEER THINGS YOU DO HEAR THESE DAYS TO BE SURE SAID SAM
AH SAID TED YOU DO IF YOU LISTEN BUT I CAN HEAR FIRESIDETALES AND CHILDRENS STORIES AT HOME IF I WANT TO
NO DOUBT YOU CAN RETORTED SAM AND I DARESAY THERES MORE TRUTH IN SOME OF THEM THAN YOU RECKON WHO INVENTED THE STORIES ANYWAY TAKE DRAGONS NOW
NO THANK EE SAID TED I WONT I HEARD TELL OF THEM WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER BUT THERES NO CALL TO BELIEVE IN THEM NOW THERES ONLY ONE DRAGON IN BYWATER AND THATS GREEN HE SAID GETTING A GENERAL LAUGH
ALL RIGHT SAID SAM LAUGHING WITH THE REST BUT WHAT ABOUT THESE TREEMEN THESE GIANTS AS YOU MIGHT CALL THEM THEY DO SAY THAT ONE BIGGER THAN A TREE WAS SEEN UP AWAY BEYOND THE NORTH MOORS NOT LONG BACK
WHOS THEY 
MY COUSIN HAL FOR ONE HE WORKS FOR MR BOFFIN AT OVERHILL AND GOES UP TO THE NORTHFARTHING FOR THE HUNTING HE SAW ONE
SAYS HE DID PERHAPS YOUR HALS ALWAYS SAYING HES SEEN THINGS AND MAYBE HE SEES THINGS THAT AINT THERE
BUT THIS ONE WAS AS BIG AS AN ELM TREE AND WALKING  WALKING SEVEN YARDS TO A STRIDE IF IT WAS AN INCH
THEN I BET IT WASNT AN INCH WHAT HE SAW WAS AN ELM TREE AS LIKE AS NOT
BUT THIS ONE WAS WALKING I TELL YOU AND THERE AINT NO ELM TREE ON THE NORTH MOORS
THEN HAL CANT HAVE SEEN ONE SAID TED THERE WAS SOME LAUGHING AND CLAPPING THE AUDIENCE SEEMED TO THINK THAT TED HAD SCORED A POINT
ALL THE SAME SAID SAM YOU CANT DENY THAT OTHERS BESIDES OUR HALFAST HAVE SEEN QUEER FOLK CROSSING THE SHIRE  CROSSING IT MIND YOU THERE ARE MORE THAT ARE TURNED BACK AT THE BORDERS THE BOUNDERS HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BUSY BEFORE
AND IVE HEARD TELL THAT ELVES ARE MOVING WEST THEY DO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO THE HARBOURS OUT AWAY BEYOND THE WHITE TOWERS SAM WAVED HIS ARM VAGUELY NEITHER HE NOR ANY OF THEM KNEW HOW FAR IT WAS TO THE SEA PAST THE OLD TOWERS BEYOND THE WESTERN BORDERS OF THE SHIRE BUT IT WAS AN OLD TRADITION THAT AWAY OVER THERE STOOD THE GREY HAVENS FROM WHICH AT TIMES ELVENSHIPS SET SAIL NEVER TO RETURN
THEY ARE SAILING SAILING SAILING OVER THE SEA THEY ARE GOING INTO THE WEST AND LEAVING US SAID SAM HALF CHANTING THE WORDS SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY AND SOLEMNLY BUT TED LAUGHED
WELL THAT ISNT ANYTHING NEW IF YOU BELIEVE THE OLD TALES AND I DONT SEE WHAT IT MATTERS TO ME OR YOU LET THEM SAIL BUT I WARRANT YOU HAVENT SEEN THEM DOING IT NOR ANY ONE ELSE IN THE SHIRE
WELL I DONT KNOW SAID SAM THOUGHTFULLY HE BELIEVED HE HAD ONCE SEEN AN ELF IN THE WOODS AND STILL HOPED TO SEE MORE ONE DAY OF ALL THE LEGENDS THAT HE HAD HEARD IN HIS EARLY YEARS SUCH FRAGMENTS OF TALES AND HALFREMEMBERED STORIES ABOUT THE ELVES AS THE HOBBITS KNEW HAD ALWAYS MOVED HIM MOST DEEPLY THERE ARE SOME EVEN IN THESE PARTS AS KNOW THE FAIR FOLK AND GET NEWS OF THEM HE SAID THERES MR BAGGINS NOW THAT I WORK FOR HE TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE SAILING AND HE KNOWS A BIT ABOUT ELVES AND OLD MR BILBO KNEW MORE MANYS THE TALK I HAD WITH HIM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE LAD
OH THEYRE BOTH CRACKED SAID TED LEASTWAYS OLD BILBO WAS CRACKED AND FRODOS CRACKING IF THATS WHERE YOU GET YOUR NEWS FROM YOULL NEVER WANT FOR MOONSHINE WELL FRIENDS IM OFF HOME YOUR GOOD HEALTH HE DRAINED HIS MUG AND WENT OUT NOISILY
SAM SAT SILENT AND SAID NO MORE HE HAD A GOOD DEAL TO THINK ABOUT FOR ONE THING THERE WAS A LOT TO DO UP IN THE BAG END GARDEN AND HE WOULD HAVE A BUSY DAY TOMORROW IF THE WEATHER CLEARED THE GRASS WAS GROWING FAST BUT SAM HAD MORE ON HIS MIND THAN GARDENING AFTER A WHILE HE SIGHED AND GOT UP AND WENT OUT
IT WAS EARLY APRIL AND THE SKY WAS NOW CLEARING AFTER HEAVY RAIN THE SUN WAS DOWN AND A COOL PALE EVENING WAS QUIETLY FADING INTO NIGHT HE WALKED HOME UNDER THE EARLY STARS THROUGH HOBBITON AND UP THE HILL WHISTLING SOFTLY AND THOUGHTFULLY
IT WAS JUST AT THIS TIME THAT GANDALF REAPPEARED AFTER HIS LONG ABSENCE FOR THREE YEARS AFTER THE PARTY HE HAD BEEN AWAY THEN HE PAID FRODO A BRIEF VISIT AND AFTER TAKING A GOOD LOOK AT HIM HE WENT OFF AGAIN DURING THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO HE HAD TURNED UP FAIRLY OFTEN COMING UNEXPECTEDLY AFTER DUSK AND GOING OFF WITHOUT WARNING BEFORE SUNRISE HE WOULD NOT DISCUSS HIS OWN BUSINESS AND JOURNEYS AND SEEMED CHIEFLY INTERESTED IN SMALL NEWS ABOUT FRODOS HEALTH AND DOINGS
THEN SUDDENLY HIS VISITS HAD CEASED IT WAS OVER NINE YEARS SINCE FRODO HAD SEEN OR HEARD OF HIM AND HE HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT THE WIZARD WOULD NEVER RETURN AND HAD GIVEN UP ALL INTEREST IN HOBBITS BUT THAT EVENING AS SAM WAS WALKING HOME AND TWILIGHT WAS FADING THERE CAME THE ONCE FAMILIAR TAP ON THE STUDY WINDOW
FRODO WELCOMED HIS OLD FRIEND WITH SURPRISE AND GREAT DELIGHT THEY LOOKED HARD AT ONE ANOTHER
AH WELL EH SAID GANDALF YOU LOOK THE SAME AS EVER FRODO
SO DO YOU FRODO REPLIED BUT SECRETLY HE THOUGHT THAT GANDALF LOOKED OLDER AND MORE CAREWORN HE PRESSED HIM FOR NEWS OF HIMSELF AND OF THE WIDE WORLD AND SOON THEY WERE DEEP IN TALK AND THEY STAYED UP FAR INTO THE NIGHT
NEXT MORNING AFTER A LATE BREAKFAST THE WIZARD WAS SITTING WITH FRODO BY THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE STUDY A BRIGHT FIRE WAS ON THE HEARTH BUT THE SUN WAS WARM AND THE WIND WAS IN THE SOUTH EVERYTHING LOOKED FRESH AND THE NEW GREEN OF SPRING WAS SHIMMERING IN THE FIELDS AND ON THE TIPS OF THE TREES FINGERS
GANDALF WAS THINKING OF A SPRING NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS BEFORE WHEN BILBO HAD RUN OUT OF BAG END WITHOUT A HANDKERCHIEF HIS HAIR WAS PERHAPS WHITER THAN IT HAD BEEN THEN AND HIS BEARD AND EYEBROWS WERE PERHAPS LONGER AND HIS FACE MORE LINED WITH CARE AND WISDOM BUT HIS EYES WERE AS BRIGHT AS EVER AND HE SMOKED AND BLEW SMOKERINGS WITH THE SAME VIGOUR AND DELIGHT

HE WAS SMOKING NOW IN SILENCE FOR FRODO WAS SITTING STILL DEEP IN THOUGHT EVEN IN THE LIGHT OF MORNING HE FELT THE DARK SHADOW OF THE TIDINGS THAT GANDALF HAD BROUGHT AT LAST HE BROKE THE SILENCE
LAST NIGHT YOU BEGAN TO TELL ME STRANGE THINGS ABOUT MY RING GANDALF HE SAID AND THEN YOU STOPPED BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT SUCH MATTERS WERE BEST LEFT UNTIL DAYLIGHT DONT YOU THINK YOU HAD BETTER FINISH NOW YOU SAY THE RING IS DANGEROUS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN I GUESS IN WHAT WAY
IN MANY WAYS ANSWERED THE WIZARD IT IS FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN I EVER DARED TO THINK AT FIRST SO POWERFUL THAT IN THE END IT WOULD UTTERLY OVERCOME ANYONE OF MORTAL RACE WHO POSSESSED IT IT WOULD POSSESS HIM
IN EREGION LONG AGO MANY ELVENRINGS WERE MADE MAGIC RINGS AS YOU CALL THEM AND THEY WERE OF COURSE OF VARIOUS KINDS SOME MORE POTENT AND SOME LESS THE LESSER RINGS WERE ONLY ESSAYS IN THE CRAFT BEFORE IT WAS FULLGROWN AND TO THE ELVENSMITHS THEY WERE BUT TRIFLES  YET STILL TO MY MIND DANGEROUS FOR MORTALS BUT THE GREAT RINGS THE RINGS OF POWER THEY WERE PERILOUS
A MORTAL FRODO WHO KEEPS ONE OF THE GREAT RINGS DOES NOT DIE BUT HE DOES NOT GROW OR OBTAIN MORE LIFE HE MERELY CONTINUES UNTIL AT LAST EVERY MINUTE IS A WEARINESS AND IF HE OFTEN USES THE RING TO MAKE HIMSELF INVISIBLE HE FADES HE BECOMES IN THE END INVISIBLE PERMANENTLY AND WALKS IN THE TWILIGHT UNDER THE EYE OF THE DARK POWER THAT RULES THE RINGS YES SOONER OR LATER  LATER IF HE IS STRONG OR WELLMEANING TO BEGIN WITH BUT NEITHER STRENGTH NOR GOOD PURPOSE WILL LAST  SOONER OR LATER THE DARK POWER WILL DEVOUR HIM
HOW TERRIFYING SAID FRODO THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG SILENCE THE SOUND OF SAM GAMGEE CUTTING THE LAWN CAME IN FROM THE GARDEN
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN THIS ASKED FRODO AT LENGTH AND HOW MUCH DID BILBO KNOW
BILBO KNEW NO MORE THAN HE TOLD YOU I AM SURE SAID GANDALF HE WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER HAVE PASSED ON TO YOU ANYTHING THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE A DANGER EVEN THOUGH I PROMISED TO LOOK AFTER YOU HE THOUGHT THE RING WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY USEFUL AT NEED AND IF ANYTHING WAS WRONG OR QUEER IT WAS HIMSELF HE SAID THAT IT WAS GROWING ON HIS MIND AND HE WAS ALWAYS WORRYING ABOUT IT BUT HE DID NOT SUSPECT THAT THE RING ITSELF WAS TO BLAME THOUGH HE HAD FOUND OUT THAT THE THING NEEDED LOOKING AFTER IT DID NOT SEEM ALWAYS OF THE SAME SIZE OR WEIGHT IT SHRANK OR EXPANDED IN AN ODD WAY AND MIGHT SUDDENLY SLIP OFF A FINGER WHERE IT HAD BEEN TIGHT
YES HE WARNED ME OF THAT IN HIS LAST LETTER SAID FRODO SO I HAVE ALWAYS KEPT IT ON ITS CHAIN
VERY WISE SAID GANDALF BUT AS FOR HIS LONG LIFE BILBO NEVER CONNECTED IT WITH THE RING AT ALL HE TOOK ALL THE CREDIT FOR THAT TO HIMSELF AND HE WAS VERY PROUD OF IT THOUGH HE WAS GETTING RESTLESS AND UNEASY THIN AND STRETCHED HE SAID A SIGN THAT THE RING WAS GETTING CONTROL
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ALL THIS ASKED FRODO AGAIN
KNOWN SAID GANDALF I HAVE KNOWN MUCH THAT ONLY THE WISE KNOW FRODO BUT IF YOU MEAN KNOWN ABOUT THIS RING WELL I STILL DO NOT KNOW ONE MIGHT SAY THERE IS A LAST TEST TO MAKE BUT I NO LONGER DOUBT MY GUESS
WHEN DID I FIRST BEGIN TO GUESS HE MUSED SEARCHING BACK IN MEMORY LET ME SEE  IT WAS IN THE YEAR THAT THE WHITE COUNCIL DROVE THE DARK POWER FROM MIRKWOOD JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES THAT BILBO FOUND HIS RING A SHADOW FELL ON MY HEART THEN THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW YET WHAT I FEARED I WONDERED OFTEN HOW GOLLUM CAME BY A GREAT RING AS PLAINLY IT WAS  THAT AT LEAST WAS CLEAR FROM THE FIRST THEN I HEARD BILBOS STRANGE STORY OF HOW HE HAD WON IT AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WHEN I AT LAST GOT THE TRUTH OUT OF HIM I SAW AT ONCE THAT HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO PUT HIS CLAIM TO THE RING BEYOND DOUBT MUCH LIKE GOLLUM WITH HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT THE LIES WERE TOO MUCH ALIKE FOR MY COMFORT CLEARLY THE RING HAD AN UNWHOLESOME POWER THAT SET TO WORK ON ITS KEEPER AT ONCE THAT WAS THE FIRST REAL WARNING I HAD THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL I TOLD BILBO OFTEN THAT SUCH RINGS WERE BETTER LEFT UNUSED BUT HE RESENTED IT AND SOON GOT ANGRY THERE WAS LITTLE ELSE THAT I COULD DO I COULD NOT TAKE IT FROM HIM WITHOUT DOING GREATER HARM AND I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO ANYWAY I COULD ONLY WATCH AND WAIT I MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE CONSULTED SARUMAN THE WHITE BUT SOMETHING ALWAYS HELD ME BACK
WHO IS HE ASKED FRODO I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE
MAYBE NOT ANSWERED GANDALF HOBBITS ARE OR WERE NO CONCERN OF HIS YET HE IS GREAT AMONG THE WISE HE IS THE CHIEF OF MY ORDER AND THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL HIS KNOWLEDGE IS DEEP BUT HIS PRIDE HAS GROWN WITH IT AND HE TAKES ILL ANY MEDDLING THE LORE OF THE ELVENRINGS GREAT AND SMALL IS HIS PROVINCE HE HAS LONG STUDIED IT SEEKING THE LOST SECRETS OF THEIR MAKING BUT WHEN THE RINGS WERE DEBATED IN THE COUNCIL ALL THAT HE WOULD REVEAL TO US OF HIS RINGLORE TOLD AGAINST MY FEARS SO MY DOUBT SLEPT  BUT UNEASILY STILL I WATCHED AND I WAITED
AND ALL SEEMED WELL WITH BILBO AND THE YEARS PASSED YES THEY PASSED AND THEY SEEMED NOT TO TOUCH HIM HE SHOWED NO SIGNS OF AGE THE SHADOW FELL ON ME AGAIN BUT I SAID TO MYSELF AFTER ALL HE COMES OF A LONGLIVED FAMILY ON HIS MOTHERS SIDE THERE IS TIME YET WAIT
AND I WAITED UNTIL THAT NIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THIS HOUSE HE SAID AND DID THINGS THEN THAT FILLED ME WITH A FEAR THAT NO WORDS OF SARUMAN COULD ALLAY I KNEW AT LAST THAT SOMETHING DARK AND DEADLY WAS AT WORK AND I HAVE SPENT MOST OF THE YEARS SINCE THEN IN FINDING OUT THE TRUTH OF IT
THERE WASNT ANY PERMANENT HARM DONE WAS THERE ASKED FRODO ANXIOUSLY HE WOULD GET ALL RIGHT IN TIME WOULDNT HE BE ABLE TO REST IN PEACE I MEAN
HE FELT BETTER AT ONCE SAID GANDALF BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE POWER IN THIS WORLD THAT KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE RINGS AND THEIR EFFECTS AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE IS NO POWER IN THE WORLD THAT KNOWS ALL ABOUT HOBBITS AMONG THE WISE I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT GOES IN FOR HOBBITLORE AN OBSCURE BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE BUT FULL OF SURPRISES SOFT AS BUTTER THEY CAN BE AND YET SOMETIMES AS TOUGH AS OLD TREEROOTS I THINK IT LIKELY THAT SOME WOULD RESIST THE RINGS FAR LONGER THAN MOST OF THE WISE WOULD BELIEVE I DONT THINK YOU NEED WORRY ABOUT BILBO
OF COURSE HE POSSESSED THE RING FOR MANY YEARS AND USED IT SO IT MIGHT TAKE A LONG WHILE FOR THE INFLUENCE TO WEAR OFF  BEFORE IT WAS SAFE FOR HIM TO SEE IT AGAIN FOR INSTANCE OTHERWISE HE MIGHT LIVE ON FOR YEARS QUITE HAPPILY JUST STOP AS HE WAS WHEN HE PARTED WITH IT FOR HE GAVE IT UP IN THE END OF HIS OWN ACCORD AN IMPORTANT POINT NO I WAS NOT TROUBLED ABOUT DEAR BILBO ANY MORE ONCE HE HAD LET THE THING GO IT IS FOR YOU THAT I FEEL RESPONSIBLE
EVER SINCE BILBO LEFT I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT YOU AND ABOUT ALL THESE CHARMING ABSURD HELPLESS HOBBITS IT WOULD BE A GRIEVOUS BLOW TO THE WORLD IF THE DARK POWER OVERCAME THE SHIRE IF ALL YOUR KIND JOLLY STUPID BOLGERS HORNBLOWERS BOFFINS BRACEGIRDLES AND THE REST NOT TO MENTION THE RIDICULOUS BAGGINSES BECAME ENSLAVED
FRODO SHUDDERED BUT WHY SHOULD WE BE HE ASKED AND WHY SHOULD HE WANT SUCH SLAVES
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH REPLIED GANDALF I BELIEVE THAT HITHERTO  HITHERTO MARK YOU  HE HAS ENTIRELY OVERLOOKED THE EXISTENCE OF HOBBITS YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL BUT YOUR SAFETY HAS PASSED HE DOES NOT NEED YOU  HE HAS MANY MORE USEFUL SERVANTS  BUT HE WONT FORGET YOU AGAIN AND HOBBITS AS MISERABLE SLAVES WOULD PLEASE HIM FAR MORE THAN HOBBITS HAPPY AND FREE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS MALICE AND REVENGE
REVENGE SAID FRODO REVENGE FOR WHAT I STILL DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THIS HAS TO DO WITH BILBO AND MYSELF AND OUR RING
IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT SAID GANDALF YOU DO NOT KNOW THE REAL PERIL YET BUT YOU SHALL I WAS NOT SURE OF IT MYSELF WHEN I WAS LAST HERE BUT THE TIME HAS COME TO SPEAK GIVE ME THE RING FOR A MOMENT
FRODO TOOK IT FROM HIS BREECHESPOCKET WHERE IT WAS CLASPED TO A CHAIN THAT HUNG FROM HIS BELT HE UNFASTENED IT AND HANDED IT SLOWLY TO THE WIZARD IT FELT SUDDENLY VERY HEAVY AS IF EITHER IT OR FRODO HIMSELF WAS IN SOME WAY RELUCTANT FOR GANDALF TO TOUCH IT
GANDALF HELD IT UP IT LOOKED TO BE MADE OF PURE AND SOLID GOLD CAN YOU SEE ANY MARKINGS ON IT HE ASKED
NO SAID FRODO THERE ARE NONE IT IS QUITE PLAIN AND IT NEVER SHOWS A SCRATCH OR SIGN OF WEAR
WELL THEN LOOK TO FRODOS ASTONISHMENT AND DISTRESS THE WIZARD THREW IT SUDDENLY INTO THE MIDDLE OF A GLOWING CORNER OF THE FIRE FRODO GAVE A CRY AND GROPED FOR THE TONGS BUT GANDALF HELD HIM BACK
WAIT HE SAID IN A COMMANDING VOICE GIVING FRODO A QUICK LOOK FROM UNDER HIS BRISTLING BROWS
NO APPARENT CHANGE CAME OVER THE RING AFTER A WHILE GANDALF GOT UP CLOSED THE SHUTTERS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND DREW THE CURTAINS THE ROOM BECAME DARK AND SILENT THOUGH THE CLACK OF SAMS SHEARS NOW NEARER TO THE WINDOWS COULD STILL BE HEARD FAINTLY FROM THE GARDEN FOR A MOMENT THE WIZARD STOOD LOOKING AT THE FIRE THEN HE STOOPED AND REMOVED THE RING TO THE HEARTH WITH THE TONGS AND AT ONCE PICKED IT UP FRODO GASPED
IT IS QUITE COOL SAID GANDALF TAKE IT FRODO RECEIVED IT ON HIS SHRINKING PALM IT SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME THICKER AND HEAVIER THAN EVER
HOLD IT UP SAID GANDALF AND LOOK CLOSELY
AS FRODO DID SO HE NOW SAW FINE LINES FINER THAN THE FINEST PENSTROKES RUNNING ALONG THE RING OUTSIDE AND INSIDE LINES OF FIRE THAT SEEMED TO FORM THE LETTERS OF A FLOWING SCRIPT THEY SHONE PIERCINGLY BRIGHT AND YET REMOTE AS IF OUT OF A GREAT DEPTH
I CANNOT READ THE FIERY LETTERS SAID FRODO IN A QUAVERING VOICE
NO SAID GANDALF BUT I CAN THE LETTERS ARE ELVISH OF AN ANCIENT MODE BUT THE LANGUAGE IS THAT OF MORDOR WHICH I WILL NOT UTTER HERE BUT THIS IN THE COMMON TONGUE IS WHAT IS SAID CLOSE ENOUGH
ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL ONE RING TO FIND THEM
ONE RING TO BRING THEM ALL AND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM

IT IS ONLY TWO LINES OF A VERSE LONG KNOWN IN ELVENLORE
THREE RINGS FOR THE ELVENKINGS UNDER THE SKY
SEVEN FOR THE DWARFLORDS IN THEIR HALLS OF STONE
NINE FOR MORTAL MEN DOOMED TO DIE
ONE FOR THE DARK LORD ON HIS DARK THRONE
IN THE LAND OF MORDOR WHERE THE SHADOWS LIE
ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL ONE RING TO FIND THEM
ONE RING TO BRING THEM ALL AND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM
IN THE LAND OF MORDOR WHERE THE SHADOWS LIE

HE PAUSED AND THEN SAID SLOWLY IN A DEEP VOICE THIS IS THE MASTERRING THE ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL THIS IS THE ONE RING THAT HE LOST MANY AGES AGO TO THE GREAT WEAKENING OF HIS POWER HE GREATLY DESIRES IT  BUT HE MUST NOT GET IT
FRODO SAT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS FEAR SEEMED TO STRETCH OUT A VAST HAND LIKE A DARK CLOUD RISING IN THE EAST AND LOOMING UP TO ENGULF HIM THIS RING HE STAMMERED HOW HOW ON EARTH DID IT COME TO ME
AH SAID GANDALF THAT IS A VERY LONG STORY THE BEGINNINGS LIE BACK IN THE BLACK YEARS WHICH ONLY THE LOREMASTERS NOW REMEMBER IF I WERE TO TELL YOU ALL THAT TALE WE SHOULD STILL BE SITTING HERE WHEN SPRING HAD PASSED INTO WINTER
BUT LAST NIGHT I TOLD YOU OF SAURON THE GREAT THE DARK LORD THE RUMOURS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ARE TRUE HE HAS INDEED ARISEN AGAIN AND LEFT HIS HOLD IN MIRKWOOD AND RETURNED TO HIS ANCIENT FASTNESS IN THE DARK TOWER OF MORDOR THAT NAME EVEN YOU HOBBITS HAVE HEARD OF LIKE A SHADOW ON THE BORDERS OF OLD STORIES ALWAYS AFTER A DEFEAT AND A RESPITE THE SHADOW TAKES ANOTHER SHAPE AND GROWS AGAIN
I WISH IT NEED NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY TIME SAID FRODO
SO DO I SAID GANDALF AND SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO SEE SUCH TIMES BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME THAT IS GIVEN US AND ALREADY FRODO OUR TIME IS BEGINNING TO LOOK BLACK THE ENEMY IS FAST BECOMING VERY STRONG HIS PLANS ARE FAR FROM RIPE I THINK BUT THEY ARE RIPENING WE SHALL BE HARD PUT TO IT WE SHOULD BE VERY HARD PUT TO IT EVEN IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS DREADFUL CHANCE
THE ENEMY STILL LACKS ONE THING TO GIVE HIM STRENGTH AND KNOWLEDGE TO BEAT DOWN ALL RESISTANCE BREAK THE LAST DEFENCES AND COVER ALL THE LANDS IN A SECOND DARKNESS HE LACKS THE ONE RING
THE THREE FAIREST OF ALL THE ELFLORDS HID FROM HIM AND HIS HAND NEVER TOUCHED THEM OR SULLIED THEM SEVEN THE DWARFKINGS POSSESSED BUT THREE HE HAS RECOVERED AND THE OTHERS THE DRAGONS HAVE CONSUMED NINE HE GAVE TO MORTAL MEN PROUD AND GREAT AND SO ENSNARED THEM LONG AGO THEY FELL UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE ONE AND THEY BECAME RINGWRAITHS SHADOWS UNDER HIS GREAT SHADOW HIS MOST TERRIBLE SERVANTS LONG AGO IT IS MANY A YEAR SINCE THE NINE WALKED ABROAD YET WHO KNOWS AS THE SHADOW GROWS ONCE MORE THEY TOO MAY WALK AGAIN BUT COME WE WILL NOT SPEAK OF SUCH THINGS EVEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SHIRE
SO IT IS NOW THE NINE HE HAS GATHERED TO HIMSELF THE SEVEN ALSO OR ELSE THEY ARE DESTROYED THE THREE ARE HIDDEN STILL BUT THAT NO LONGER TROUBLES HIM HE ONLY NEEDS THE ONE FOR HE MADE THAT RING HIMSELF IT IS HIS AND HE LET A GREAT PART OF HIS OWN FORMER POWER PASS INTO IT SO THAT HE COULD RULE ALL THE OTHERS IF HE RECOVERS IT THEN HE WILL COMMAND THEM ALL AGAIN WHEREVER THEY BE EVEN THE THREE AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN WROUGHT WITH THEM WILL BE LAID BARE AND HE WILL BE STRONGER THAN EVER
AND THIS IS THE DREADFUL CHANCE FRODO HE BELIEVED THAT THE ONE HAD PERISHED THAT THE ELVES HAD DESTROYED IT AS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BUT HE KNOWS NOW THAT IT HAS NOT PERISHED THAT IT HAS BEEN FOUND SO HE IS SEEKING IT SEEKING IT AND ALL HIS THOUGHT IS BENT ON IT IT IS HIS GREAT HOPE AND OUR GREAT FEAR
WHY WHY WASNT IT DESTROYED CRIED FRODO AND HOW DID THE ENEMY EVER COME TO LOSE IT IF HE WAS SO STRONG AND IT WAS SO PRECIOUS TO HIM HE CLUTCHED THE RING IN HIS HAND AS IF HE SAW ALREADY DARK FINGERS STRETCHING OUT TO SEIZE IT
IT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM SAID GANDALF THE STRENGTH OF THE ELVES TO RESIST HIM WAS GREATER LONG AGO AND NOT ALL MEN WERE ESTRANGED FROM THEM THE MEN OF WESTERNESSE CAME TO THEIR AID THAT IS A CHAPTER OF ANCIENT HISTORY WHICH IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO RECALL FOR THERE WAS SORROW THEN TOO AND GATHERING DARK BUT GREAT VALOUR AND GREAT DEEDS THAT WERE NOT WHOLLY VAIN ONE DAY PERHAPS I WILL TELL YOU ALL THE TALE OR YOU SHALL HEAR IT TOLD IN FULL BY ONE WHO KNOWS IT BEST
BUT FOR THE MOMENT SINCE MOST OF ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW THIS THING CAME TO YOU AND THAT WILL BE TALE ENOUGH THIS IS ALL THAT I WILL SAY IT WAS GILGALAD ELVENKING AND ELENDIL OF WESTERNESSE WHO OVERTHREW SAURON THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES PERISHED IN THE DEED AND ISILDUR ELENDILS SON CUT THE RING FROM SAURONS HAND AND TOOK IT FOR HIS OWN THEN SAURON WAS VANQUISHED AND HIS SPIRIT FLED AND WAS HIDDEN FOR LONG YEARS UNTIL HIS SHADOW TOOK SHAPE AGAIN IN MIRKWOOD
BUT THE RING WAS LOST IT FELL INTO THE GREAT RIVER ANDUIN AND VANISHED FOR ISILDUR WAS MARCHING NORTH ALONG THE EAST BANKS OF THE RIVER AND NEAR THE GLADDEN FIELDS HE WAS WAYLAID BY THE ORCS OF THE MOUNTAINS AND ALMOST ALL HIS FOLK WERE SLAIN HE LEAPED INTO THE WATERS BUT THE RING SLIPPED FROM HIS FINGER AS HE SWAM AND THEN THE ORCS SAW HIM AND KILLED HIM WITH ARROWS
GANDALF PAUSED AND THERE IN THE DARK POOLS AMID THE GLADDEN FIELDS HE SAID THE RING PASSED OUT OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEGEND AND EVEN SO MUCH OF ITS HISTORY IS KNOWN NOW ONLY TO A FEW AND THE COUNCIL OF THE WISE COULD DISCOVER NO MORE BUT AT LAST I CAN CARRY ON THE STORY I THINK
LONG AFTER BUT STILL VERY LONG AGO THERE LIVED BY THE BANKS OF THE GREAT RIVER ON THE EDGE OF WILDERLAND A CLEVERHANDED AND QUIETFOOTED LITTLE PEOPLE I GUESS THEY WERE OF HOBBITKIND AKIN TO THE FATHERS OF THE FATHERS OF THE STOORS FOR THEY LOVED THE RIVER AND OFTEN SWAM IN IT OR MADE LITTLE BOATS OF REEDS THERE WAS AMONG THEM A FAMILY OF HIGH REPUTE FOR IT WAS LARGE AND WEALTHIER THAN MOST AND IT WAS RULED BY A GRANDMOTHER OF THE FOLK STERN AND WISE IN OLD LORE SUCH AS THEY HAD THE MOST INQUISITIVE AND CURIOUSMINDED OF THAT FAMILY WAS CALLED SMEAGOL HE WAS INTERESTED IN ROOTS AND BEGINNINGS HE DIVED INTO DEEP POOLS HE BURROWED UNDER TREES AND GROWING PLANTS HE TUNNELLED INTO GREEN MOUNDS AND HE CEASED TO LOOK UP AT THE HILLTOPS OR THE LEAVES ON TREES OR THE FLOWERS OPENING IN THE AIR HIS HEAD AND HIS EYES WERE DOWNWARD
HE HAD A FRIEND CALLED DEAGOL OF SIMILAR SORT SHARPEREYED BUT NOT SO QUICK AND STRONG ON A TIME THEY TOOK A BOAT AND WENT DOWN TO THE GLADDEN FIELDS WHERE THERE WERE GREAT BEDS OF IRIS AND FLOWERING REEDS THERE SMEAGOL GOT OUT AND WENT NOSING ABOUT THE BANKS BUT DEAGOL SAT IN THE BOAT AND FISHED SUDDENLY A GREAT FISH TOOK HIS HOOK AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS HE WAS DRAGGED OUT AND DOWN INTO THE WATER TO THE BOTTOM THEN HE LET GO OF HIS LINE FOR HE THOUGHT HE SAW SOMETHING SHINING IN THE RIVERBED AND HOLDING HIS BREATH HE GRABBED AT IT
THEN UP HE CAME SPLUTTERING WITH WEEDS IN HIS HAIR AND A HANDFUL OF MUD AND HE SWAM TO THE BANK AND BEHOLD WHEN HE WASHED THE MUD AWAY THERE IN HIS HAND LAY A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN RING AND IT SHONE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUN SO THAT HIS HEART WAS GLAD BUT SMEAGOL HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM FROM BEHIND A TREE AND AS DEAGOL GLOATED OVER THE RING SMEAGOL CAME SOFTLY UP BEHIND
GIVE US THAT DEAGOL MY LOVE SAID SMEAGOL OVER HIS FRIENDS SHOULDER
WHY SAID DEAGOL
BECAUSE ITS MY BIRTHDAY MY LOVE AND I WANTS IT SAID SMEAGOL
I DONT CARE SAID DEAGOL I HAVE GIVEN YOU A PRESENT ALREADY MORE THAN I COULD AFFORD I FOUND THIS AND IM GOING TO KEEP IT
OH ARE YOU INDEED MY LOVE SAID SMEAGOL AND HE CAUGHT DEAGOL BY THE THROAT AND STRANGLED HIM BECAUSE THE GOLD LOOKED SO BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL THEN HE PUT THE RING ON HIS FINGER
NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAD BECOME OF DEAGOL HE WAS MURDERED FAR FROM HOME AND HIS BODY WAS CUNNINGLY HIDDEN BUT SMEAGOL RETURNED ALONE AND HE FOUND THAT NONE OF HIS FAMILY COULD SEE HIM WHEN HE WAS WEARING THE RING HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS DISCOVERY AND HE CONCEALED IT AND HE USED IT TO FIND OUT SECRETS AND HE PUT HIS KNOWLEDGE TO CROOKED AND MALICIOUS USES HE BECAME SHARPEYED AND KEENEARED FOR ALL THAT WAS HURTFUL THE RING HAD GIVEN HIM POWER ACCORDING TO HIS STATURE IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT HE BECAME VERY UNPOPULAR AND WAS SHUNNED WHEN VISIBLE BY ALL HIS RELATIONS THEY KICKED HIM AND HE BIT THEIR FEET HE TOOK TO THIEVING AND GOING ABOUT MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND GURGLING IN HIS THROAT SO THEY CALLED HIM GOLLUM AND CURSED HIM AND TOLD HIM TO GO FAR AWAY AND HIS GRANDMOTHER DESIRING PEACE EXPELLED HIM FROM THE FAMILY AND TURNED HIM OUT OF HER HOLE
HE WANDERED IN LONELINESS WEEPING A LITTLE FOR THE HARDNESS OF THE WORLD AND HE JOURNEYED UP THE RIVER TILL HE CAME TO A STREAM THAT FLOWED DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND HE WENT THAT WAY HE CAUGHT FISH IN DEEP POOLS WITH INVISIBLE FINGERS AND ATE THEM RAW ONE DAY IT WAS VERY HOT AND AS HE WAS BENDING OVER A POOL HE FELT A BURNING ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND A DAZZLING LIGHT FROM THE WATER PAINED HIS WET EYES HE WONDERED AT IT FOR HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE SUN THEN FOR THE LAST TIME HE LOOKED UP AND SHOOK HIS FIST AT HER
BUT AS HE LOWERED HIS EYES HE SAW FAR ABOVE THE TOPS OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS OUT OF WHICH THE STREAM CAME AND HE THOUGHT SUDDENLY IT WOULD BE COOL AND SHADY UNDER THOSE MOUNTAINS THE SUN COULD NOT WATCH ME THERE THE ROOTS OF THOSE MOUNTAINS MUST BE ROOTS INDEED THERE MUST BE GREAT SECRETS BURIED THERE WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN DISCOVERED SINCE THE BEGINNING
SO HE JOURNEYED BY NIGHT UP INTO THE HIGHLANDS AND HE FOUND A LITTLE CAVE OUT OF WHICH THE DARK STREAM RAN AND HE WORMED HIS WAY LIKE A MAGGOT INTO THE HEART OF THE HILLS AND VANISHED OUT OF ALL KNOWLEDGE THE RING WENT INTO THE SHADOWS WITH HIM AND EVEN THE MAKER WHEN HIS POWER HAD BEGUN TO GROW AGAIN COULD LEARN NOTHING OF IT
GOLLUM CRIED FRODO GOLLUM DO YOU MEAN THAT THIS IS THE VERY GOLLUMCREATURE THAT BILBO MET HOW LOATHSOME
I THINK IT IS A SAD STORY SAID THE WIZARD AND IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO OTHERS EVEN TO SOME HOBBITS THAT I HAVE KNOWN
I CANT BELIEVE THAT GOLLUM WAS CONNECTED WITH HOBBITS HOWEVER DISTANTLY SAID FRODO WITH SOME HEAT WHAT AN ABOMINABLE NOTION
IT IS TRUE ALL THE SAME REPLIED GANDALF ABOUT THEIR ORIGINS AT ANY RATE I KNOW MORE THAN HOBBITS DO THEMSELVES AND EVEN BILBOS STORY SUGGESTS THE KINSHIP THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL IN THE BACKGROUND OF THEIR MINDS AND MEMORIES THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR THEY UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER REMARKABLY WELL VERY MUCH BETTER THAN A HOBBIT WOULD UNDERSTAND SAY A DWARF OR AN ORC OR EVEN AN ELF THINK OF THE RIDDLES THEY BOTH KNEW FOR ONE THING
YES SAID FRODO THOUGH OTHER FOLKS BESIDES HOBBITS ASK RIDDLES AND OF MUCH THE SAME SORT AND HOBBITS DONT CHEAT GOLLUM MEANT TO CHEAT ALL THE TIME HE WAS JUST TRYING TO PUT POOR BILBO OFF HIS GUARD AND I DARESAY IT AMUSED HIS WICKEDNESS TO START A GAME WHICH MIGHT END IN PROVIDING HIM WITH AN EASY VICTIM BUT IF HE LOST WOULD NOT HURT HIM
ONLY TOO TRUE I FEAR SAID GANDALF BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN IT I THINK WHICH YOU DONT SEE YET EVEN GOLLUM WAS NOT WHOLLY RUINED HE HAD PROVED TOUGHER THAN EVEN ONE OF THE WISE WOULD HAVE GUESSED AS A HOBBIT MIGHT THERE WAS A LITTLE CORNER OF HIS MIND THAT WAS STILL HIS OWN AND LIGHT CAME THROUGH IT AS THROUGH A CHINK IN THE DARK LIGHT OUT OF THE PAST IT WAS ACTUALLY PLEASANT I THINK TO HEAR A KINDLY VOICE AGAIN BRINGING UP MEMORIES OF WIND AND TREES AND SUN ON THE GRASS AND SUCH FORGOTTEN THINGS
BUT THAT OF COURSE WOULD ONLY MAKE THE EVIL PART OF HIM ANGRIER IN THE END  UNLESS IT COULD BE CONQUERED UNLESS IT COULD BE CURED GANDALF SIGHED ALAS THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF THAT FOR HIM YET NOT NO HOPE NO NOT THOUGH HE POSSESSED THE RING SO LONG ALMOST AS FAR BACK AS HE CAN REMEMBER FOR IT WAS LONG SINCE HE HAD WORN IT MUCH IN THE BLACK DARKNESS IT WAS SELDOM NEEDED CERTAINLY HE HAD NEVER FADED HE IS THIN AND TOUGH STILL BUT THE THING WAS EATING UP HIS MIND OF COURSE AND THE TORMENT HAD BECOME ALMOST UNBEARABLE
ALL THE GREAT SECRETS UNDER THE MOUNTAINS HAD TURNED OUT TO BE JUST EMPTY NIGHT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO FIND OUT NOTHING WORTH DOING ONLY NASTY FURTIVE EATING AND RESENTFUL REMEMBERING HE WAS ALTOGETHER WRETCHED HE HATED THE DARK AND HE HATED LIGHT MORE HE HATED EVERYTHING AND THE RING MOST OF ALL
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID FRODO SURELY THE RING WAS HIS PRECIOUS AND THE ONLY THING HE CARED FOR BUT IF HE HATED IT WHY DIDNT HE GET RID OF IT OR GO AWAY AND LEAVE IT
YOU OUGHT TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND FRODO AFTER ALL YOU HAVE HEARD SAID GANDALF HE HATED IT AND LOVED IT AS HE HATED AND LOVED HIMSELF HE COULD NOT GET RID OF IT HE HAD NO WILL LEFT IN THE MATTER
A RING OF POWER LOOKS AFTER ITSELF FRODO IT MAY SLIP OFF TREACHEROUSLY BUT ITS KEEPER NEVER ABANDONS IT AT MOST HE PLAYS WITH THE IDEA OF HANDING IT ON TO SOMEONE ELSES CARE  AND THAT ONLY AT AN EARLY STAGE WHEN IT FIRST BEGINS TO GRIP BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW BILBO ALONE IN HISTORY HAS EVER GONE BEYOND PLAYING AND REALLY DONE IT HE NEEDED ALL MY HELP TOO AND EVEN SO HE WOULD NEVER HAVE JUST FORSAKEN IT OR CAST IT ASIDE IT WAS NOT GOLLUM FRODO BUT THE RING ITSELF THAT DECIDED THINGS THE RING LEFT HIM
WHAT JUST IN TIME TO MEET BILBO SAID FRODO WOULDNT AN ORC HAVE SUITED IT BETTER
IT IS NO LAUGHING MATTER SAID GANDALF NOT FOR YOU IT WAS THE STRANGEST EVENT IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE RING SO FAR BILBOS ARRIVAL JUST AT THAT TIME AND PUTTING HIS HAND ON IT BLINDLY IN THE DARK
THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE POWER AT WORK FRODO THE RING WAS TRYING TO GET BACK TO ITS MASTER IT HAD SLIPPED FROM ISILDURS HAND AND BETRAYED HIM THEN WHEN A CHANCE CAME IT CAUGHT POOR DEAGOL AND HE WAS MURDERED AND AFTER THAT GOLLUM AND IT HAD DEVOURED HIM IT COULD MAKE NO FURTHER USE OF HIM HE WAS TOO SMALL AND MEAN AND AS LONG AS IT STAYED WITH HIM HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS DEEP POOL AGAIN SO NOW WHEN ITS MASTER WAS AWAKE ONCE MORE AND SENDING OUT HIS DARK THOUGHT FROM MIRKWOOD IT ABANDONED GOLLUM ONLY TO BE PICKED UP BY THE MOST UNLIKELY PERSON IMAGINABLE BILBO FROM THE SHIRE
BEHIND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE AT WORK BEYOND ANY DESIGN OF THE RINGMAKER I CAN PUT IT NO PLAINER THAN BY SAYING THAT BILBO WAS MEANT TO FIND THE RING AND NOT BY ITS MAKER IN WHICH CASE YOU ALSO WERE MEANT TO HAVE IT AND THAT MAYBE AN ENCOURAGING THOUGHT
IT IS NOT SAID FRODO THOUGH I AM NOT SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU BUT HOW HAVE YOU LEARNED ALL THIS ABOUT THE RING AND ABOUT GOLLUM DO YOU REALLY KNOW IT ALL OR ARE YOU JUST GUESSING STILL
GANDALF LOOKED AT FRODO AND HIS EYES GLINTED I KNEW MUCH AND I HAVE LEARNED MUCH HE ANSWERED BUT I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF ALL MY DOINGS TO YOU THE HISTORY OF ELENDIL AND ISILDUR AND THE ONE RING IS KNOWN TO ALL THE WISE YOUR RING IS SHOWN TO BE THAT ONE RING BY THE FIREWRITING ALONE APART FROM ANY OTHER EVIDENCE
AND WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER THAT ASKED FRODO INTERRUPTING
JUST NOW IN THIS ROOM OF COURSE ANSWERED THE WIZARD SHARPLY BUT I EXPECTED TO FIND IT I HAVE COME BACK FROM DARK JOURNEYS AND LONG SEARCH TO MAKE THAT FINAL TEST IT IS THE LAST PROOF AND ALL IS NOW ONLY TOO CLEAR MAKING OUT GOLLUMS PART AND FITTING IT INTO THE GAP IN THE HISTORY REQUIRED SOME THOUGHT I MAY HAVE STARTED WITH GUESSES ABOUT GOLLUM BUT I AM NOT GUESSING NOW I KNOW I HAVE SEEN HIM
YOU HAVE SEEN GOLLUM EXCLAIMED FRODO IN AMAZEMENT
YES THE OBVIOUS THING TO DO OF COURSE IF ONE COULD I TRIED LONG AGO BUT I HAVE MANAGED IT AT LAST
THEN WHAT HAPPENED AFTER BILBO ESCAPED FROM HIM DO YOU KNOW THAT
NOT SO CLEARLY WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU IS WHAT GOLLUM WAS WILLING TO TELL  THOUGH NOT OF COURSE IN THE WAY I HAVE REPORTED IT GOLLUM IS A LIAR AND YOU HAVE TO SIFT HIS WORDS FOR INSTANCE HE CALLED THE RING HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND HE STUCK TO THAT HE SAID IT CAME FROM HIS GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS OF THAT KIND A RIDICULOUS STORY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SMEAGOLS GRANDMOTHER WAS A MATRIARCH A GREAT PERSON IN HER WAY BUT TO TALK OF HER POSSESSING MANY ELVENRINGS WAS ABSURD AND AS FOR GIVING THEM AWAY IT WAS A LIE BUT A LIE WITH A GRAIN OF TRUTH
THE MURDER OF DEAGOL HAUNTED GOLLUM AND HE HAD MADE UP A DEFENCE REPEATING IT TO HIS PRECIOUS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS HE GNAWED BONES IN THE DARK UNTIL HE ALMOST BELIEVED IT IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY DEAGOL OUGHT TO HAVE GIVEN THE RING TO HIM IT HAD PREVIOUSLY TURNED UP JUST SO AS TO BE A PRESENT IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND SO ON AND ON
I ENDURED HIM AS LONG AS I COULD BUT THE TRUTH WAS DESPERATELY IMPORTANT AND IN THE END I HAD TO BE HARSH I PUT THE FEAR OF FIRE ON HIM AND WRUNG THE TRUE STORY OUT OF HIM BIT BY BIT TOGETHER WITH MUCH SNIVELLING AND SNARLING HE THOUGHT HE WAS MISUNDERSTOOD AND ILLUSED BUT WHEN HE HAD AT LAST TOLD ME HIS HISTORY AS FAR AS THE END OF THE RIDDLEGAME AND BILBOS ESCAPE HE WOULD NOT SAY ANY MORE EXCEPT IN DARK HINTS SOME OTHER FEAR WAS ON HIM GREATER THAN MINE HE MUTTERED THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET HIS OWN BACK PEOPLE WOULD SEE IF HE WOULD STAND BEING KICKED AND DRIVEN INTO A HOLE AND THEN ROBBED GOLLUM HAD GOOD FRIENDS NOW GOOD FRIENDS AND VERY STRONG THEY WOULD HELP HIM BAGGINS WOULD PAY FOR IT THAT WAS HIS CHIEF THOUGHT HE HATED BILBO AND CURSED HIS NAME WHAT IS MORE HE KNEW WHERE HE CAME FROM
BUT HOW DID HE FIND THAT OUT ASKED FRODO
WELL AS FOR THE NAME BILBO VERY FOOLISHLY TOLD GOLLUM HIMSELF AND AFTER THAT IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER HIS COUNTRY ONCE GOLLUM CAME OUT OH YES HE CAME OUT HIS LONGING FOR THE RING PROVED STRONGER THAN HIS FEAR OF THE ORCS OR EVEN OF THE LIGHT AFTER A YEAR OR TWO HE LEFT THE MOUNTAINS YOU SEE THOUGH STILL BOUND BY DESIRE OF IT THE RING WAS NO LONGER DEVOURING HIM HE BEGAN TO REVIVE A LITTLE HE FELT OLD TERRIBLY OLD YET LESS TIMID AND HE WAS MORTALLY HUNGRY
LIGHT LIGHT OF SUN AND MOON HE STILL FEARED AND HATED AND HE ALWAYS WILL I THINK BUT HE WAS CUNNING HE FOUND HE COULD HIDE FROM DAYLIGHT AND MOONSHINE AND MAKE HIS WAY SWIFTLY AND SOFTLY BY DEAD OF NIGHT WITH HIS PALE COLD EYES AND CATCH SMALL FRIGHTENED OR UNWARY THINGS HE GREW STRONGER AND BOLDER WITH NEW FOOD AND NEW AIR HE FOUND HIS WAY INTO MIRKWOOD AS ONE WOULD EXPECT
IS THAT WHERE YOU FOUND HIM ASKED FRODO
I SAW HIM THERE ANSWERED GANDALF BUT BEFORE THAT HE HAD WANDERED FAR FOLLOWING BILBOS TRAIL IT WAS DIFFICULT TO LEARN ANYTHING FROM HIM FOR CERTAIN FOR HIS TALK WAS CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED BY CURSES AND THREATS WHAT HAD IT GOT IN ITS POCKETSES HE SAID IT WOULDNT SAY NO PRECIOUS LITTLE CHEAT NOT A FAIR QUESTION IT CHEATED FIRST IT DID IT BROKE THE RULES WE OUGHT TO HAVE SQUEEZED IT YES PRECIOUS AND WE WILL PRECIOUS
THAT IS A SAMPLE OF HIS TALK I DONT SUPPOSE YOU WANT ANY MORE I HAD WEARY DAYS OF IT BUT FROM HINTS DROPPED AMONG THE SNARLS I EVEN GATHERED THAT HIS PADDING FEET HAD TAKEN HIM AT LAST TO ESGAROTH AND EVEN TO THE STREETS OF DALE LISTENING SECRETLY AND PEERING WELL THE NEWS OF THE GREAT EVENTS WENT FAR AND WIDE IN WILDERLAND AND MANY HAD HEARD BILBOS NAME AND KNEW WHERE HE CAME FROM WE HAD MADE NO SECRET OF OUR RETURN JOURNEY TO HIS HOME IN THE WEST GOLLUMS SHARP EARS WOULD SOON LEARN WHAT HE WANTED
THEN WHY DIDNT HE TRACK BILBO FURTHER ASKED FRODO WHY DIDNT HE COME TO THE SHIRE
AH SAID GANDALF NOW WE COME TO IT I THINK GOLLUM TRIED TO HE SET OUT AND CAME BACK WESTWARD AS FAR AS THE GREAT RIVER BUT THEN HE TURNED ASIDE HE WAS NOT DAUNTED BY THE DISTANCE I AM SURE NO SOMETHING ELSE DREW HIM AWAY SO MY FRIENDS THINK THOSE THAT HUNTED HIM FOR ME
THE WOODELVES TRACKED HIM FIRST AN EASY TASK FOR THEM FOR HIS TRAIL WAS STILL FRESH THEN THROUGH MIRKWOOD AND BACK AGAIN IT LED THEM THOUGH THEY NEVER CAUGHT HIM THE WOOD WAS FULL OF THE RUMOUR OF HIM DREADFUL TALES EVEN AMONG BEASTS AND BIRDS THE WOODMEN SAID THAT THERE WAS SOME NEW TERROR ABROAD A GHOST THAT DRANK BLOOD IT CLIMBED TREES TO FIND NESTS IT CREPT INTO HOLES TO FIND THE YOUNG IT SLIPPED THROUGH WINDOWS TO FIND CRADLES
BUT AT THE WESTERN EDGE OF MIRKWOOD THE TRAIL TURNED AWAY IT WANDERED OFF SOUTHWARDS AND PASSED OUT OF THE WOODELVES KEN AND WAS LOST AND THEN I MADE A GREAT MISTAKE YES FRODO AND NOT THE FIRST THOUGH I FEAR IT MAY PROVE THE WORST I LET THE MATTER BE I LET HIM GO FOR I HAD MUCH ELSE TO THINK OF AT THAT TIME AND I STILL TRUSTED THE LORE OF SARUMAN
WELL THAT WAS YEARS AGO I HAVE PAID FOR IT SINCE WITH MANY DARK AND DANGEROUS DAYS THE TRAIL WAS LONG COLD WHEN I TOOK IT UP AGAIN AFTER BILBO LEFT HERE AND MY SEARCH WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN BUT FOR THE HELP THAT I HAD FROM A FRIEND ARAGORN THE GREATEST TRAVELLER AND HUNTSMAN OF THIS AGE OF THE WORLD TOGETHER WE SOUGHT FOR GOLLUM DOWN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF WILDERLAND WITHOUT HOPE AND WITHOUT SUCCESS BUT AT LAST WHEN I HAD GIVEN UP THE CHASE AND TURNED TO OTHER PARTS GOLLUM WAS FOUND MY FRIEND RETURNED OUT OF THE GREAT PERILS BRINGING THE MISERABLE CREATURE WITH HIM
WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING HE WOULD NOT SAY HE ONLY WEPT AND CALLED US CRUEL WITH MANY A GOLLUM IN HIS THROAT AND WHEN WE PRESSED HIM HE WHINED AND CRINGED AND RUBBED HIS LONG HANDS LICKING HIS FINGERS AS IF THEY PAINED HIM AS IF HE REMEMBERED SOME OLD TORTURE BUT I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO POSSIBLE DOUBT HE HAD MADE HIS SLOW SNEAKING WAY STEP BY STEP MILE BY MILE SOUTH DOWN AT LAST TO THE LAND OF MORDOR
A HEAVY SILENCE FELL IN THE ROOM FRODO COULD HEAR HIS HEART BEATING EVEN OUTSIDE EVERYTHING SEEMED STILL NO SOUND OF SAMS SHEARS COULD NOW BE HEARD
YES TO MORDOR SAID GANDALF ALAS MORDOR DRAWS ALL WICKED THINGS AND THE DARK POWER WAS BENDING ALL ITS WILL TO GATHER THEM THERE THE RING OF THE ENEMY WOULD LEAVE ITS MARK TOO LEAVE HIM OPEN TO THE SUMMONS AND ALL FOLK WERE WHISPERING THEN OF THE NEW SHADOW IN THE SOUTH AND ITS HATRED OF THE WEST THERE WERE HIS FINE NEW FRIENDS WHO WOULD HELP HIM IN HIS REVENGE
WRETCHED FOOL IN THAT LAND HE WOULD LEARN MUCH TOO MUCH FOR HIS COMFORT AND SOONER OR LATER AS HE LURKED AND PRIED ON THE BORDERS HE WOULD BE CAUGHT AND TAKEN  FOR EXAMINATION THAT WAS THE WAY OF IT I FEAR WHEN HE WAS FOUND HE HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE LONG AND WAS ON HIS WAY BACK ON SOME ERRAND OF MISCHIEF BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER MUCH NOW HIS WORST MISCHIEF WAS DONE
YES ALAS THROUGH HIM THE ENEMY HAS LEARNED THAT THE ONE HAS BEEN FOUND AGAIN HE KNOWS WHERE ISILDUR FELL HE KNOWS WHERE GOLLUM FOUND HIS RING HE KNOWS THAT IT IS A GREAT RING FOR IT GAVE LONG LIFE HE KNOWS THAT IT IS NOT ONE OF THE THREE FOR THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN LOST AND THEY ENDURE NO EVIL HE KNOWS THAT IT IS NOT ONE OF THE SEVEN OR THE NINE FOR THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR HE KNOWS THAT IT IS THE ONE AND HE HAS AT LAST HEARD I THINK OF HOBBITS AND THE SHIRE
THE SHIRE  HE MAY BE SEEKING FOR IT NOW IF HE HAS NOT ALREADY FOUND OUT WHERE IT LIES INDEED FRODO I FEAR THAT HE MAY EVEN THINK THAT THE LONGUNNOTICED NAME OF BAGGINS HAS BECOME IMPORTANT
BUT THIS IS TERRIBLE CRIED FRODO FAR WORSE THAN THE WORST THAT I IMAGINED FROM YOUR HINTS AND WARNINGS O GANDALF BEST OF FRIENDS WHAT AM I TO DO FOR NOW I AM REALLY AFRAID WHAT AM I TO DO WHAT A PITY THAT BILBO DID NOT STAB THAT VILE CREATURE WHEN HE HAD A CHANCE
PITY IT WAS PITY THAT STAYED HIS HAND PITY AND MERCY NOT TO STRIKE WITHOUT NEED AND HE HAS BEEN WELL REWARDED FRODO BE SURE THAT HE TOOK SO LITTLE HURT FROM THE EVIL AND ESCAPED IN THE END BECAUSE HE BEGAN HIS OWNERSHIP OF THE RING SO WITH PITY
I AM SORRY SAID FRODO BUT I AM FRIGHTENED AND I DO NOT FEEL ANY PITY FOR GOLLUM
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM GANDALF BROKE IN
NO AND I DONT WANT TO SAID FRODO I CANT UNDERSTAND YOU DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU AND THE ELVES HAVE LET HIM LIVE ON AFTER ALL THOSE HORRIBLE DEEDS NOW AT ANY RATE HE IS AS BAD AS AN ORC AND JUST AN ENEMY HE DESERVES DEATH
DESERVES IT I DARESAY HE DOES MANY THAT LIVE DESERVE DEATH AND SOME THAT DIE DESERVE LIFE CAN YOU GIVE IT TO THEM THEN DO NOT BE TOO EAGER TO DEAL OUT DEATH IN JUDGEMENT FOR EVEN THE VERY WISE CANNOT SEE ALL ENDS I HAVE NOT MUCH HOPE THAT GOLLUM CAN BE CURED BEFORE HE DIES BUT THERE IS A CHANCE OF IT AND HE IS BOUND UP WITH THE FATE OF THE RING MY HEART TELLS ME THAT HE HAS SOME PART TO PLAY YET FOR GOOD OR ILL BEFORE THE END AND WHEN THAT COMES THE PITY OF BILBO MAY RULE THE FATE OF MANY  YOURS NOT LEAST IN ANY CASE WE DID NOT KILL HIM HE IS VERY OLD AND VERY WRETCHED THE WOODELVES HAVE HIM IN PRISON BUT THEY TREAT HIM WITH SUCH KINDNESS AS THEY CAN FIND IN THEIR WISE HEARTS
ALL THE SAME SAID FRODO EVEN IF BILBO COULD NOT KILL GOLLUM I WISH HE HAD NOT KEPT THE RING I WISH HE HAD NEVER FOUND IT AND THAT I HAD NOT GOT IT WHY DID YOU LET ME KEEP IT WHY DIDNT YOU MAKE ME THROW IT AWAY OR OR DESTROY IT
LET YOU MAKE YOU SAID THE WIZARD HAVENT YOU BEEN LISTENING TO ALL THAT I HAVE SAID YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BUT AS FOR THROWING IT AWAY THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG THESE RINGS HAVE A WAY OF BEING FOUND IN EVIL HANDS IT MIGHT HAVE DONE GREAT EVIL WORST OF ALL IT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY INDEED IT CERTAINLY WOULD FOR THIS IS THE ONE AND HE IS EXERTING ALL HIS POWER TO FIND IT OR DRAW IT TO HIMSELF
OF COURSE MY DEAR FRODO IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR YOU AND THAT HAS TROUBLED ME DEEPLY BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH AT STAKE THAT I HAD TO TAKE SOME RISK  THOUGH EVEN WHEN I WAS FAR AWAY THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A DAY WHEN THE SHIRE HAS NOT BEEN GUARDED BY WATCHFUL EYES AS LONG AS YOU NEVER USED IT I DID NOT THINK THAT THE RING WOULD HAVE ANY LASTING EFFECT ON YOU NOT FOR EVIL NOT AT ANY RATE FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT NINE YEARS AGO WHEN I LAST SAW YOU I STILL KNEW LITTLE FOR CERTAIN
BUT WHY NOT DESTROY IT AS YOU SAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE LONG AGO CRIED FRODO AGAIN IF YOU HAD WARNED ME OR EVEN SENT ME A MESSAGE I WOULD HAVE DONE AWAY WITH IT
WOULD YOU HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
NO BUT I SUPPOSE ONE COULD HAMMER IT OR MELT IT
TRY SAID GANDALF TRY NOW
FRODO DREW THE RING OUT OF HIS POCKET AGAIN AND LOOKED AT IT IT NOW APPEARED PLAIN AND SMOOTH WITHOUT MARK OR DEVICE THAT HE COULD SEE THE GOLD LOOKED VERY FAIR AND PURE AND FRODO THOUGHT HOW RICH AND BEAUTIFUL WAS ITS COLOUR HOW PERFECT WAS ITS ROUNDNESS IT WAS AN ADMIRABLE THING AND ALTOGETHER PRECIOUS WHEN HE TOOK IT OUT HE HAD INTENDED TO FLING IT FROM HIM INTO THE VERY HOTTEST PART OF THE FIRE BUT HE FOUND NOW THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO NOT WITHOUT A GREAT STRUGGLE HE WEIGHED THE RING IN HIS HAND HESITATING AND FORCING HIMSELF TO REMEMBER ALL THAT GANDALF HAD TOLD HIM AND THEN WITH AN EFFORT OF WILL HE MADE A MOVEMENT AS IF TO CAST IT AWAY  BUT HE FOUND THAT HE HAD PUT IT BACK IN HIS POCKET
GANDALF LAUGHED GRIMLY YOU SEE ALREADY YOU TOO FRODO CANNOT EASILY LET IT GO NOR WILL TO DAMAGE IT AND I COULD NOT MAKE YOU  EXCEPT BY FORCE WHICH WOULD BREAK YOUR MIND BUT AS FOR BREAKING THE RING FORCE IS USELESS EVEN IF YOU TOOK IT AND STRUCK IT WITH A HEAVY SLEDGEHAMMER IT WOULD MAKE NO DINT IN IT IT CANNOT BE UNMADE BY YOUR HANDS OR BY MINE
YOUR SMALL FIRE OF COURSE WOULD NOT MELT EVEN ORDINARY GOLD THIS RING HAS ALREADY PASSED THROUGH IT UNSCATHED AND EVEN UNHEATED BUT THERE IS NO SMITHS FORGE IN THIS SHIRE THAT COULD CHANGE IT AT ALL NOT EVEN THE ANVILS AND FURNACES OF THE DWARVES COULD DO THAT IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT DRAGONFIRE COULD MELT AND CONSUME THE RINGS OF POWER BUT THERE IS NOT NOW ANY DRAGON LEFT ON EARTH IN WHICH THE OLD FIRE IS HOT ENOUGH NOR WAS THERE EVER ANY DRAGON NOT EVEN ANCALAGON THE BLACK WHO COULD HAVE HARMED THE ONE RING THE RULING RING FOR THAT WAS MADE BY SAURON HIMSELF THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND THE CRACKS OF DOOM IN THE DEPTHS OF ORODRUIN THE FIREMOUNTAIN AND CAST THE RING IN THERE IF YOU REALLY WISH TO DESTROY IT TO PUT IT BEYOND THE GRASP OF THE ENEMY FOR EVER
I DO REALLY WISH TO DESTROY IT CRIED FRODO OR WELL TO HAVE IT DESTROYED I AM NOT MADE FOR PERILOUS QUESTS I WISH I HAD NEVER SEEN THE RING WHY DID IT COME TO ME WHY WAS I CHOSEN
SUCH QUESTIONS CANNOT BE ANSWERED SAID GANDALF YOU MAY BE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT FOR ANY MERIT THAT OTHERS DO NOT POSSESS NOT FOR POWER OR WISDOM AT ANY RATE BUT YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN AND YOU MUST THEREFORE USE SUCH STRENGTH AND HEART AND WITS AS YOU HAVE
BUT I HAVE SO LITTLE OF ANY OF THESE THINGS YOU ARE WISE AND POWERFUL WILL YOU NOT TAKE THE RING
NO CRIED GANDALF SPRINGING TO HIS FEET WITH THAT POWER I SHOULD HAVE POWER TOO GREAT AND TERRIBLE AND OVER ME THE RING WOULD GAIN A POWER STILL GREATER AND MORE DEADLY HIS EYES FLASHED AND HIS FACE WAS LIT AS BY A FIRE WITHIN DO NOT TEMPT ME FOR I DO NOT WISH TO BECOME LIKE THE DARK LORD HIMSELF YET THE WAY OF THE RING TO MY HEART IS BY PITY PITY FOR WEAKNESS AND THE DESIRE OF STRENGTH TO DO GOOD DO NOT TEMPT ME I DARE NOT TAKE IT NOT EVEN TO KEEP IT SAFE UNUSED THE WISH TO WIELD IT WOULD BE TOO GREAT FOR MY STRENGTH I SHALL HAVE SUCH NEED OF IT GREAT PERILS LIE BEFORE ME
HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND DREW ASIDE THE CURTAINS AND THE SHUTTERS SUNLIGHT STREAMED BACK AGAIN INTO THE ROOM SAM PASSED ALONG THE PATH OUTSIDE WHISTLING AND NOW SAID THE WIZARD TURNING BACK TO FRODO THE DECISION LIES WITH YOU BUT I WILL ALWAYS HELP YOU HE LAID HIS HAND ON FRODOS SHOULDER I WILL HELP YOU BEAR THIS BURDEN AS LONG AS IT IS YOURS TO BEAR BUT WE MUST DO SOMETHING SOON THE ENEMY IS MOVING
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE GANDALF SAT DOWN AGAIN AND PUFFED AT HIS PIPE AS IF LOST IN THOUGHT HIS EYES SEEMED CLOSED BUT UNDER THE LIDS HE WAS WATCHING FRODO INTENTLY FRODO GAZED FIXEDLY AT THE RED EMBERS ON THE HEARTH UNTIL THEY FILLED ALL HIS VISION AND HE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING DOWN INTO PROFOUND WELLS OF FIRE HE WAS THINKING OF THE FABLED CRACKS OF DOOM AND THE TERROR OF THE FIERY MOUNTAIN
WELL SAID GANDALF AT LAST WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT TO DO
NO ANSWERED FRODO COMING BACK TO HIMSELF OUT OF DARKNESS AND FINDING TO HIS SURPRISE THAT IT WAS NOT DARK AND THAT OUT OF THE WINDOW HE COULD SEE THE SUNLIT GARDEN OR PERHAPS YES AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID I SUPPOSE I MUST KEEP THE RING AND GUARD IT AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT WHATEVER IT MAY DO TO ME
WHATEVER IT MAY DO IT WILL BE SLOW SLOW TO EVIL IF YOU KEEP IT WITH THAT PURPOSE SAID GANDALF
I HOPE SO SAID FRODO BUT I HOPE THAT YOU MAY FIND SOME OTHER BETTER KEEPER SOON BUT IN THE MEANWHILE IT SEEMS THAT I AM A DANGER A DANGER TO ALL THAT LIVE NEAR ME I CANNOT KEEP THE RING AND STAY HERE I OUGHT TO LEAVE BAG END LEAVE THE SHIRE LEAVE EVERYTHING AND GO AWAY HE SIGHED
I SHOULD LIKE TO SAVE THE SHIRE IF I COULD  THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I THOUGHT THE INHABITANTS TOO STUPID AND DULL FOR WORDS AND HAVE FELT THAT AN EARTHQUAKE OR AN INVASION OF DRAGONS MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THEM BUT I DONT FEEL LIKE THAT NOW I FEEL THAT AS LONG AS THE SHIRE LIES BEHIND SAFE AND COMFORTABLE I SHALL FIND WANDERING MORE BEARABLE I SHALL KNOW THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A FIRM FOOTHOLD EVEN IF MY FEET CANNOT STAND THERE AGAIN
OF COURSE I HAVE SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF GOING AWAY BUT I IMAGINED THAT AS A KIND OF HOLIDAY A SERIES OF ADVENTURES LIKE BILBOS OR BETTER ENDING IN PEACE BUT THIS WOULD MEAN EXILE A FLIGHT FROM DANGER INTO DANGER DRAWING IT AFTER ME AND I SUPPOSE I MUST GO ALONE IF I AM TO DO THAT AND SAVE THE SHIRE BUT I FEEL VERY SMALL AND VERY UPROOTED AND WELL  DESPERATE THE ENEMY IS SO STRONG AND TERRIBLE
HE DID NOT TELL GANDALF BUT AS HE WAS SPEAKING A GREAT DESIRE TO FOLLOW BILBO FLAMED UP IN HIS HEART  TO FOLLOW BILBO AND EVEN PERHAPS TO FIND HIM AGAIN IT WAS SO STRONG THAT IT OVERCAME HIS FEAR HE COULD ALMOST HAVE RUN OUT THERE AND THEN DOWN THE ROAD WITHOUT HIS HAT AS BILBO HAD DONE ON A SIMILAR MORNING LONG AGO
MY DEAR FRODO EXCLAIMED GANDALF HOBBITS REALLY ARE AMAZING CREATURES AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE YOU CAN LEARN ALL THAT THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR WAYS IN A MONTH AND YET AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS THEY CAN STILL SURPRISE YOU AT A PINCH I HARDLY EXPECTED TO GET SUCH AN ANSWER NOT EVEN FROM YOU BUT BILBO MADE NO MISTAKE IN CHOOSING HIS HEIR THOUGH HE LITTLE THOUGHT HOW IMPORTANT IT WOULD PROVE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RIGHT THE RING WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAY HIDDEN IN THE SHIRE MUCH LONGER AND FOR YOUR OWN SAKE AS WELL AS FOR OTHERS YOU WILL HAVE TO GO AND LEAVE THE NAME OF BAGGINS BEHIND YOU THAT NAME WILL NOT BE SAFE TO HAVE OUTSIDE THE SHIRE OR IN THE WILD I WILL GIVE YOU A TRAVELLING NAME NOW WHEN YOU GO GO AS MR UNDERHILL
BUT I DONT THINK YOU NEED GO ALONE NOT IF YOU KNOW OF ANYONE YOU CAN TRUST AND WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO GO BY YOUR SIDE  AND THAT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE INTO UNKNOWN PERILS BUT IF YOU LOOK FOR A COMPANION BE CAREFUL IN CHOOSING AND BE CAREFUL OF WHAT YOU SAY EVEN TO YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS THE ENEMY HAS MANY SPIES AND MANY WAYS OF HEARING
SUDDENLY HE STOPPED AS IF LISTENING FRODO BECAME AWARE THAT ALL WAS VERY QUIET INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GANDALF CREPT TO ONE SIDE OF THE WINDOW THEN WITH A DART HE SPRANG TO THE SILL AND THRUST A LONG ARM OUT AND DOWNWARDS THERE WAS A SQUAWK AND UP CAME SAM GAMGEES CURLY HEAD HAULED BY ONE EAR
WELL WELL BLESS MY BEARD SAID GANDALF SAM GAMGEE IS IT NOW WHAT MAY YOU BE DOING
LOR BLESS YOU MR GANDALF SIR SAID SAM NOTHING LEASTWAYS I WAS JUST TRIMMING THE GRASSBORDER UNDER THE WINDOW IF YOU FOLLOW ME HE PICKED UP HIS SHEARS AND EXHIBITED THEM AS EVIDENCE
I DONT SAID GANDALF GRIMLY IT IS SOME TIME SINCE I LAST HEARD THE SOUND OF YOUR SHEARS HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN EAVESDROPPING

CHAPTER 3
THREE IS COMPANY

YOU OUGHT TO GO QUIETLY AND YOU OUGHT TO GO SOON SAID GANDALF TWO OR THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED AND STILL FRODO MADE NO SIGN OF GETTING READY TO GO
I KNOW BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DO BOTH HE OBJECTED IF I JUST VANISH LIKE BILBO THE TALE WILL BE ALL OVER THE SHIRE IN NO TIME
OF COURSE YOU MUSTNT VANISH SAID GANDALF THAT WOULDNT DO AT ALL I SAID SOON NOT INSTANTLY IF YOU CAN THINK OF ANY WAY OF SLIPPING OUT OF THE SHIRE WITHOUT ITS BEING GENERALLY KNOWN IT WILL BE WORTH A LITTLE DELAY BUT YOU MUST NOT DELAY TOO LONG
WHAT ABOUT THE AUTUMN ON OR AFTER OUR BIRTHDAY ASKED FRODO I THINK I COULD PROBABLY MAKE SOME ARRANGEMENTS BY THEN
TO TELL THE TRUTH HE WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO START NOW THAT IT HAD COME TO THE POINT BAG END SEEMED A MORE DESIRABLE RESIDENCE THAN IT HAD FOR YEARS AND HE WANTED TO SAVOUR AS MUCH AS HE COULD OF HIS LAST SUMMER IN THE SHIRE WHEN AUTUMN CAME HE KNEW THAT PART AT LEAST OF HIS HEART WOULD THINK MORE KINDLY OF JOURNEYING AS IT ALWAYS DID AT THAT SEASON HE HAD INDEED PRIVATELY MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE ON HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY BILBOS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYEIGHTH IT SEEMED SOMEHOW THE PROPER DAY ON WHICH TO SET OUT AND FOLLOW HIM FOLLOWING BILBO WAS UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND AND THE ONE THING THAT MADE THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING BEARABLE HE THOUGHT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE RING AND WHERE IT MIGHT LEAD HIM IN THE END BUT HE DID NOT TELL ALL HIS THOUGHTS TO GANDALF WHAT THE WIZARD GUESSED WAS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO TELL
HE LOOKED AT FRODO AND SMILED VERY WELL HE SAID I THINK THAT WILL DO  BUT IT MUST NOT BE ANY LATER I AM GETTING VERY ANXIOUS IN THE MEANWHILE DO TAKE CARE AND DONT LET OUT ANY HINT OF WHERE YOU ARE GOING AND SEE THAT SAM GAMGEE DOES NOT TALK IF HE DOES I REALLY SHALL TURN HIM INTO A TOAD
AS FOR WHERE I AM GOING SAID FRODO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO GIVE THAT AWAY FOR I HAVE NO CLEAR IDEA MYSELF YET
DONT BE ABSURD SAID GANDALF I AM NOT WARNING YOU AGAINST LEAVING AN ADDRESS AT THE POSTOFFICE BUT YOU ARE LEAVING THE SHIRE  AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL YOU ARE FAR AWAY AND YOU MUST GO OR AT LEAST SET OUT EITHER NORTH SOUTH WEST OR EAST  AND THE DIRECTION SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE KNOWN
I HAVE BEEN SO TAKEN UP WITH THE THOUGHTS OF LEAVING BAG END AND OF SAYING FAREWELL THAT I HAVE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED THE DIRECTION SAID FRODO FOR WHERE AM I TO GO AND BY WHAT SHALL I STEER WHAT IS TO BE MY QUEST BILBO WENT TO FIND A TREASURE THERE AND BACK AGAIN BUT I GO TO LOSE ONE AND NOT RETURN AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
BUT YOU CANNOT SEE VERY FAR SAID GANDALF NEITHER CAN I IT MAY BE YOUR TASK TO FIND THE CRACKS OF DOOM BUT THAT QUEST MAY BE FOR OTHERS I DO NOT KNOW AT ANY RATE YOU ARE NOT READY FOR THAT LONG ROAD YET
NO INDEED SAID FRODO BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT COURSE AM I TO LAKE
TOWARDS DANGER BUT NOT TOO RASHLY NOR TOO STRAIGHT ANSWERED THE WIZARD IF YOU WANT MY ADVICE MAKE FOR RIVENDELL THAT JOURNEY SHOULD NOT PROVE TOO PERILOUS THOUGH THE ROAD IS LESS EASY THAN IT WAS AND IT WILL GROW WORSE AS THE YEAR FAILS
RIVENDELL SAID FRODO VERY GOOD I WILL GO EAST AND I WILL MAKE FOR RIVENDELL I WILL TAKE SAM TO VISIT THE ELVES HE WILL BE DELIGHTED HE SPOKE LIGHTLY BUT HIS HEART WAS MOVED SUDDENLY WITH A DESIRE TO SEE THE HOUSE OF ELROND HALFELVEN AND BREATHE THE AIR OF THAT DEEP VALLEY WHERE MANY OF THE FAIR FOLK STILL DWELT IN PEACE
ONE SUMMERS EVENING AN ASTONISHING PIECE OF NEWS REACHED THE IVY BUSH AND GREEN DRAGON GIANTS AND OTHER PORTENTS ON THE BORDERS OF THE SHIRE WERE FORGOTTEN FOR MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS MR FRODO WAS SELLING BAG END INDEED HE HAD ALREADY SOLD IT  TO THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES
FOR A NICE BIT LOO SAID SOME AT A BARGAIN PRICE SAID OTHERS AND THATS MORE LIKELY WHEN MISTRESS LOBELIAS THE BUYER OTHO HAD DIED SOME YEARS BEFORE AT THE RIPE BUT DISAPPOINTED AGE OF 102
JUST WHY MR FRODO WAS SELLING HIS BEAUTIFUL HOLE WAS EVEN MORE DEBATABLE THAN THE PRICE A FEW HELD THE THEORY  SUPPORTED BY THE NODS AND HINTS OF MR BAGGINS HIMSELF  THAT FRODOS MONEY WAS RUNNING OUT HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE HOBBITON AND LIVE IN A QUIET WAY ON THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE DOWN IN BUCKLAND AMONG HIS BRANDYBUCK RELATIONS AS FAR FROM THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES AS MAY BE SOME ADDED BUT SO FIRMLY FIXED HAD THE NOTION OF THE IMMEASURABLE WEALTH OF THE BAGGINSES OF BAG END BECOME THAT MOST FOUND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE HARDER THAN ANY OTHER REASON OR UNREASON THAT THEIR FANCY COULD SUGGEST TO MOST IT SUGGESTED A DARK AND YET UNREVEALED PLOT BY GANDALF THOUGH HE KEPT HIMSELF VERY QUIET AND DID NOT GO ABOUT BY DAY IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT HE WAS HIDING UP IN THE BAG END BUT HOWEVER A REMOVAL MIGHT FIT IN WITH THE DESIGNS OF HIS WIZARDRY THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE FACT FRODO BAGGINS WAS GOING BACK TO BUCKLAND
YES I SHALL BE MOVING THIS AUTUMN HE SAID MERRY BRANDYBUCK IS LOOKING OUT FOR A NICE LITTLE HOLE FOR ME OR PERHAPS A SMALL HOUSE
AS A MATTER OF FACT WITH MERRYS HELP HE HAD ALREADY CHOSEN AND BOUGHT A LITTLE HOUSE AT CRICKHOLLOW IN THE COUNTRY BEYOND BUCKLEBURY TO ALL BUT SAM HE PRETENDED HE WAS GOING TO SETTLE DOWN THERE PERMANENTLY THE DECISION TO SET OUT EASTWARDS HAD SUGGESTED THE IDEA TO HIM FOR BUCKLAND WAS ON THE EASTERN BORDERS OF THE SHIRE AND AS HE HAD LIVED THERE IN CHILDHOOD HIS GOING BACK WOULD AT LEAST SEEM CREDIBLE
GANDALF STAYED IN THE SHIRE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS THEN ONE EVENING AT THE END OF JUNE SOON AFTER FRODOS PLAN HAD BEEN FINALLY ARRANGED HE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING ONLY FOR A SHORT WHILE I HOPE HE SAID BUT I AM GOING DOWN BEYOND THE SOUTHERN BORDERS TO GET SOME NEWS IF I CAN I HAVE BEEN IDLE LONGER THAN I SHOULD
HE SPOKE LIGHTLY BUT IT SEEMED TO FRODO THAT HE LOOKED RATHER WORRIED HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED HE ASKED
WELL NO BUT I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE ME ANXIOUS AND NEEDS LOOKING INTO IF I THINK IT NECESSARY AFTER ALL FOR YOU TO GET OFF AT ONCE I SHALL COME BACK IMMEDIATELY OR AT LEAST SEND WORD IN THE MEANWHILE STICK TO YOUR PLAN BUT BE MORE CAREFUL THAN EVER ESPECIALLY OF THE RING LET ME IMPRESS ON YOU ONCE MORE DONT USE IT
HE WENT OFF AT DAWN I MAY BE BACK ANY DAY HE SAID AT THE VERY LATEST I SHALL COME BACK FOR THE FAREWELL PARTY I THINK AFTER ALL YOU MAY NEED MY COMPANY ON THE ROAD
AT FIRST FRODO WAS A GOOD DEAL DISTURBED AND WONDERED OFTEN WHAT GANDALF COULD HAVE HEARD BUT HIS UNEASINESS WORE OFF AND IN THE FINE WEATHER HE FORGOT HIS TROUBLES FOR A WHILE THE SHIRE HAD SELDOM SEEN SO FAIR A SUMMER OR SO RICH AN AUTUMN THE TREES WERE LADEN WITH APPLES HONEY WAS DRIPPING IN THE COMBS AND THE CORN WAS TALL AND FULL
AUTUMN WAS WELL UNDER WAY BEFORE FRODO BEGAN TO WORRY ABOUT GANDALF AGAIN SEPTEMBER WAS PASSING AND THERE WAS STILL NO NEWS OF HIM THE BIRTHDAY AND THE REMOVAL DREW NEARER AND STILL HE DID NOT COME OR SEND WORD BAG END BEGAN TO BE BUSY SOME OF FRODOS FRIENDS CAME TO STAY AND HELP HIM WITH THE PACKING THERE WAS FREDEGAR BOLGER AND FOLCO BOFFIN AND OF COURSE HIS SPECIAL FRIENDS PIPPIN TOOK AND MERRY BRANDYBUCK BETWEEN THEM THEY TURNED THE WHOLE PLACE UPSIDEDOWN
ON SEPTEMBER 20TH TWO COVERED CARTS WENT OFF LADEN TO BUCKLAND CONVEYING THE FURNITURE AND GOODS THAT FRODO HAD NOT SOLD TO HIS NEW HOME BY WAY OF THE BRANDYWINE BRIDGE THE NEXT DAY FRODO BECAME REALLY ANXIOUS AND KEPT A CONSTANT LOOKOUT FOR GANDALF THURSDAY HIS BIRTHDAY MORNING DAWNED AS FAIR AND CLEAR AS IT HAD LONG AGO FOR BILBOS GREAT PARTY STILL GANDALF DID NOT APPEAR IN THE EVENING FRODO GAVE HIS FAREWELL FEAST IT WAS QUITE SMALL JUST A DINNER FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FOUR HELPERS BUT HE WAS TROUBLED AND FELL IN NO MOOD FOR IT THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD SO SOON HAVE TO PART WITH HIS YOUNG FRIENDS WEIGHED ON HIS HEART HE WONDERED HOW HE WOULD BREAK IT TO THEM
THE FOUR YOUNGER HOBBITS WERE HOWEVER IN HIGH SPIRITS AND THE PARTY SOON BECAME VERY CHEERFUL IN SPITE OF GANDALFS ABSENCE THE DININGROOM WAS BARE EXCEPT FOR A TABLE AND CHAIRS BUT THE FOOD WAS GOOD AND THERE WAS GOOD WINE FRODOS WINE HAD NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE SALE TO THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO THE REST OF MY STUFF WHEN THE SBS GET THEIR CLAWS ON IT AT ANY RATE I HAVE FOUND A GOOD HOME FOR THIS SAID FRODO AS HE DRAINED HIS GLASS IT WAS THE LAST DROP OF OLD WINYARDS
WHEN THEY HAD SUNG MANY SONGS AND TALKED OF MANY THINGS THEY HAD DONE TOGETHER THEY TOASTED BILBOS BIRTHDAY AND THEY DRANK HIS HEALTH AND FRODOS TOGETHER ACCORDING TO FRODOS CUSTOM THEN THEY WENT OUT FOR A SNIFF OF AIR AND GLIMPSE OF THE STARS AND THEN THEY WENT TO BED FRODOS PARTY WAS OVER AND GANDALF HAD NOT COME
THE NEXT MORNING THEY WERE BUSY PACKING ANOTHER CART WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE LUGGAGE MERRY TOOK CHARGE OF THIS AND DROVE OFF WITH FATTY THAT IS FREDEGAR BOLGER SOMEONE MUST GET THERE AND WARM THE HOUSE BEFORE YOU ARRIVE SAID MERRY WELL SEE YOU LATER  THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW IF YOU DONT GO TO SLEEP ON THE WAY
FOLCO WENT HOME AFTER LUNCH BUT PIPPIN REMAINED BEHIND FRODO WAS RESTLESS AND ANXIOUS LISTENING IN VAIN FOR A SOUND OF GANDALF HE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL NIGHTFALL AFTER THAT IF GANDALF WANTED HIM URGENTLY HE WOULD GO TO CRICKHOLLOW AND MIGHT EVEN GET THERE FIRST FOR FRODO WAS GOING ON FOOT HIS PLAN  FOR PLEASURE AND A LAST LOOK AT THE SHIRE AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER REASON  WAS TO WALK FROM HOBBITON TO BUCKLEBURY FERRY TAKING IT FAIRLY EASY
I SHALL GET MYSELF A BIT INTO TRAINING TOO HE SAID LOOKING AT HIMSELF IN A DUSTY MIRROR IN THE HALFEMPTY HALL HE HAD NOT DONE ANY STRENUOUS WALKING FOR A LONG TIME AND THE REFLECTION LOOKED RATHER FLABBY HE THOUGHT
AFTER LUNCH THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES LOBELIA AND HER SANDYHAIRED SON LOTHO TURNED UP MUCH TO FRODOS ANNOYANCE OURS AT LAST SAID LOBELIA AS SHE STEPPED INSIDE IT WAS NOT POLITE NOR STRICTLY TRUE FOR THE SALE OF BAG END DID NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT BUT LOBELIA CAN PERHAPS BE FORGIVEN SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO WAIT ABOUT SEVENTYSEVEN YEARS LONGER FOR BAG END THAN SHE ONCE HOPED AND SHE WAS NOW A HUNDRED YEARS OLD ANYWAY SHE HAD COME TO SEE THAT NOTHING SHE HAD PAID FOR HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AND SHE WANTED THE KEYS IT TOOK A LONG WHILE TO SATISFY HER AS SHE HAD BROUGHT A COMPLETE INVENTORY WITH HER AND WENT RIGHT THROUGH IT IN THE END SHE DEPARTED WITH LOTHO AND THE SPARE KEY AND THE PROMISE THAT THE OTHER KEY WOULD BE LEFT AT THE GAMGEES IN BAGSHOT ROW SHE SNORTED AND SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SHE THOUGHT THE GAMGEES CAPABLE OF PLUNDERING THE HOLE DURING THE NIGHT FRODO DID NOT OFFER HER ANY TEA
HE TOOK HIS OWN TEA WITH PIPPIN AND SAM GAMGEE IN THE KITCHEN IT HAD BEEN OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED THAT SAM WAS COMING TO BUCKLAND TO DO FOR MR FRODO AND LOOK AFTER HIS BIT OF GARDEN AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE GAFFER THOUGH IT DID NOT CONSOLE HIM FOR THE PROSPECT OF HAVING LOBELIA AS A NEIGHBOUR
OUR LAST MEAL AT BAG END SAID FRODO PUSHING BACK HIS CHAIR THEY LEFT THE WASHING UP FOR LOBELIA PIPPIN AND SAM STRAPPED UP THEIR THREE PACKS AND PILED THEM IN THE PORCH PIPPIN WENT OUT FOR A LAST STROLL IN THE GARDEN SAM DISAPPEARED
THE SUN WENT DOWN BAG END SEEMED SAD AND GLOOMY AND DISHEVELLED FRODO WANDERED ROUND THE FAMILIAR ROOMS AND SAW THE LIGHT OF THE SUNSET FADE ON THE WALLS AND SHADOWS CREEP OUT OF THE CORNERS IT GREW SLOWLY DARK INDOORS HE WENT OUT AND WALKED DOWN TO THE GATE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PATH AND THEN ON A SHORT WAY DOWN THE HILL ROAD HE HALF EXPECTED TO SEE GANDALF COME STRIDING UP THROUGH THE DUSK
THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE STARS WERE GROWING BRIGHT ITS GOING TO BE A FINE NIGHT HE SAID ALOUD THATS GOOD FOR A BEGINNING I FEEL LIKE WALKING I CANT BEAR ANY MORE HANGING ABOUT I AM GOING TO START AND GANDALF MUST FOLLOW ME HE TURNED TO GO BACK AND THEN SLOPPED FOR HE HEARD VOICES JUST ROUND THE CORNER BY THE END OF BAGSHOT ROW ONE VOICE WAS CERTAINLY THE OLD GAFFERS THE OTHER WAS STRANGE AND SOMEHOW UNPLEASANT HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT IT SAID BUT HE HEARD THE GAFFERS ANSWERS WHICH WERE RATHER SHRILL THE OLD MAN SEEMED PUT OUT

FOOTSTEPS WENT AWAY DOWN THE HILL FRODO WONDERED VAGUELY WHY THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT COME ON UP THE HILL SEEMED A GREAT RELIEF I AM SICK OF QUESTIONS AND CURIOSITY ABOUT MY DOINGS I SUPPOSE HE THOUGHT WHAT AN INQUISITIVE LOT THEY ALL ARE HE HAD HALF A MIND TO GO AND ASK THE GAFFER WHO THE INQUIRER WAS BUT HE THOUGHT BETTER OR WORSE OF IT AND TURNED AND WALKED QUICKLY BACK TO BAG END
PIPPIN WAS SITTING ON HIS PACK IN THE PORCH SAM WAS NOT THERE FRODO STEPPED INSIDE THE DARK DOOR SAM HE CALLED SAM TIME
COMING SIR CAME THE ANSWER FROM FAR WITHIN FOLLOWED SOON BY SAM HIMSELF WIPING HIS MOUTH HE HAD BEEN SAYING FAREWELL TO THE BEERBARREL IN THE CELLAR
ALL ABOARD SAM SAID FRODO
YES SIR ILL LAST FOR A BIT NOW SIR
FRODO SHUT AND LOCKED THE ROUND DOOR AND GAVE THE KEY TO SAM RUN DOWN WITH THIS TO YOUR HOME SAM HE SAID THEN CUT ALONG THE ROW AND MEET US AS QUICK AS YOU CAN AT THE GATE IN THE LANE BEYOND THE MEADOWS WE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THE VILLAGE TONIGHT TOO MANY EARS PRICKING AND EYES PRYING SAM RAN OFF AT FULL SPEED
WELL NOW WERE OFF AT LAST SAID FRODO THEY SHOULDERED THEIR PACKS AND TOOK UP THEIR STICKS AND WALKED ROUND THE CORNER TO THE WEST SIDE OF BAG END GOODBYE SAID FRODO LOOKING AT THE DARK BLANK WINDOWS HE WAVED HIS HAND AND THEN TURNED AND FOLLOWING BILBO IF HE HAD KNOWN IT HURRIED AFTER PEREGRIN DOWN THE GARDENPATH THEY JUMPED OVER THE LOW PLACE IN THE HEDGE AT THE BOTTOM AND TOOK TO THE FIELDS PASSING INTO THE DARKNESS LIKE A RUSTLE IN THE GRASSES
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL ON ITS WESTERN SIDE THEY CAME TO THE GATE OPENING ON TO A NARROW LANE THERE THEY HALTED AND ADJUSTED THE STRAPS OF THEIR PACKS PRESENTLY SAM APPEARED TROTTING QUICKLY AND BREATHING HARD HIS HEAVY PACK WAS HOISTED HIGH ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE HAD PUT ON HIS HEAD A TALL SHAPELESS FELL BAG WHICH HE CALLED A HAT IN THE GLOOM HE LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE A DWARF
I AM SURE YOU HAVE GIVEN ME ALL THE HEAVIEST STUFF SAID FRODO I PITY SNAILS AND ALL THAT CARRY THEIR HOMES ON THEIR BACKS
I COULD TAKE A LOT MORE YET SIR MY PACKET IS QUITE LIGHT SAID SAM STOUTLY AND UNTRUTHFULLY
NO YOU DONT SAM SAID PIPPIN IT IS GOOD FOR HIM HES GOT NOTHING EXCEPT WHAT HE ORDERED US TO PACK HES BEEN SLACK LATELY AND HELL FEEL THE WEIGHT LESS WHEN HES WALKED OFF SOME OF HIS OWN
BE KIND TO A POOR OLD HOBBIT LAUGHED FRODO I SHALL BE AS THIN AS A WILLOWWAND IM SURE BEFORE I GET TO BUCKLAND BUT I WAS TALKING NONSENSE I SUSPECT YOU HAVE TAKEN MORE THAN YOUR SHARE SAM AND I SHALL LOOK INTO IT AT OUR NEXT PACKING HE PICKED UP HIS STICK AGAIN WELL WE ALL LIKE WALKING IN THE DARK HE SAID SO LETS PUT SOME MILES BEHIND US BEFORE BED
FOR A SHORT WAY THEY FOLLOWED THE LANE WESTWARDS THEN LEAVING IT THEY TURNED LEFT AND TOOK QUIETLY TO THE FIELDS AGAIN THEY WENT IN SINGLE FILE ALONG HEDGEROWS AND THE BORDERS OF COPPICES AND NIGHT FELL DARK ABOUT THEM IN THEIR DARK CLOAKS THEY WERE AS INVISIBLE AS IF THEY ALL HAD MAGIC RINGS SINCE THEY WERE ALL HOBBITS AND WERE TRYING TO BE SILENT THEY MADE NO NOISE THAT EVEN HOBBITS WOULD HEAR EVEN THE WILD THINGS IN THE FIELDS AND WOODS HARDLY NOTICED THEIR PASSING
AFTER SOME TIME THEY CROSSED THE WATER WEST OF HOBBITON BY A NARROW PLANKBRIDGE THE STREAM WAS THERE NO MORE THAN A WINDING BLACK RIBBON BORDERED WITH LEANING ALDERTREES A MILE OR TWO FURTHER SOUTH THEY HASTILY CROSSED THE GREAT ROAD FROM THE BRANDYWINE BRIDGE THEY WERE NOW IN THE TOOKLAND AND BENDING SOUTHEASTWARDS THEY MADE FOR THE GREEN HILL COUNTRY AS THEY BEGAN TO CLIMB ITS FIRST SLOPES THEY LOOKED BACK AND SAW THE LAMPS IN HOBBITON FAR OFF TWINKLING IN THE GENTLE VALLEY OF THE WATER SOON IT DISAPPEARED IN THE FOLDS OF THE DARKENED LAND AND WAS FOLLOWED BY BYWATER BESIDE ITS GREY POOL WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE LAST FARM WAS FAR BEHIND PEEPING AMONG THE TREES FRODO TURNED AND WAVED A HAND IN FAREWELL
I WONDER IF I SHALL EVER LOOK DOWN INTO THAT VALLEY AGAIN HE SAID QUIETLY
WHEN THEY HAD WALKED FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS THEY RESTED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR COOL AND STARRY BUT SMOKELIKE WISPS OF MIST WERE CREEPING UP THE HILLSIDES FROM THE STREAMS AND DEEP MEADOWS THINCLAD BIRCHES SWAYING IN A LIGHT WIND ABOVE THEIR HEADS MADE A BLACK NET AGAINST THE PALE SKY THEY ATE A VERY FRUGAL SUPPER FOR HOBBITS AND THEN WENT ON AGAIN SOON THEY STRUCK A NARROW ROAD THAT WENT ROLLING UP AND DOWN FADING GREY INTO THE DARKNESS AHEAD THE ROAD TO WOODHALL AND STOCK AND THE BUCKLEBURY FERRY IT CLIMBED AWAY FROM THE MAIN ROAD IN THE WATERVALLEY AND WOUND OVER THE SKIRTS OF THE GREEN HILLS TOWARDS WOODYEND A WILD CORNER OF THE EASTFARTHING
AFTER A WHILE THEY PLUNGED INTO A DEEPLY CLOVEN TRACK BETWEEN TALL TREES THAT RUSTLED THEIR DRY LEAVES IN THE NIGHT IT WAS VERY DARK AT FIRST THEY TALKED OR HUMMED A TUNE SOFTLY TOGETHER BEING NOW FAR AWAY FROM INQUISITIVE EARS THEN THEY MARCHED ON IN SILENCE AND PIPPIN BEGAN TO LAG BEHIND AT LAST AS THEY BEGAN TO CLIMB A STEEP SLOPE HE STOPPED AND YAWNED
I AM SO SLEEPY HE SAID THAT SOON I SHALL FALL DOWN ON THE ROAD ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP ON YOUR LEGS IT IS NEARLY MIDNIGHT
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED WALKING IN THE DARK SAID FRODO BUT THERE IS NO GREAT HURRY MERRY EXPECTS US SOME TIME THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW BUT THAT LEAVES US NEARLY TWO DAYS MORE WELL HALT AT THE FIRST LIKELY SPOT
THE WINDS IN THE WEST SAID SAM IF WE GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS HILL WE SHALL FIND A SPOT THAT IS SHELTERED AND SNUG ENOUGH SIR THERE IS A DRY FIRWOOD JUST AHEAD IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY SAM KNEW THE LAND WELL WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF HOBBITON BUT THAT WAS THE LIMIT OF HIS GEOGRAPHY
JUST OVER THE TOP OF THE HILL THEY CAME ON THE PATCH OF FIRWOOD LEAVING THE ROAD THEY WENT INTO THE DEEP RESINSCENTED DARKNESS OF THE TREES AND GATHERED DEAD STICKS AND CONES TO MAKE A FIRE SOON THEY HAD A MERRY CRACKLE OF FLAME AT THE FOOT OF A LARGE FIRTREE AND THEY SAT ROUND IT FOR A WHILE UNTIL THEY BEGAN TO NOD THEN EACH IN AN ANGLE OF THE GREAT TREES ROOTS THEY CURLED UP IN THEIR CLOAKS AND BLANKETS AND WERE SOON FAST ASLEEP THEY SET NO WATCH EVEN FRODO FEARED NO DANGER YET FOR THEY WERE STILL IN THE HEART OF THE SHIRE A FEW CREATURES CAME AND LOOKED AT THEM WHEN THE FIRE HAD DIED AWAY A FOX PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD ON BUSINESS OF HIS OWN STOPPED SEVERAL MINUTES AND SNIFFED
HOBBITS HE THOUGHT WELL WHAT NEXT I HAVE HEARD OF STRANGE DOINGS IN THIS LAND BUT I HAVE SELDOM HEARD OF A HOBBIT SLEEPING OUT OF DOORS UNDER A TREE THREE OF THEM THERES SOMETHING MIGHTY QUEER BEHIND THIS HE WAS QUITE RIGHT BUT HE NEVER FOUND OUT ANY MORE ABOUT IT
THE MORNING CAME PALE AND CLAMMY FRODO WOKE UP FIRST AND FOUND THAT A TREEROOT HAD MADE A HOLE IN HIS BACK AND THAT HIS NECK WAS STIFF
WALKING FOR PLEASURE WHY DIDNT I DRIVE HE THOUGHT AS HE USUALLY DID AT THE BEGINNING OF AN EXPEDITION AND ALL MY BEAUTIFUL FEATHER BEDS ARE SOLD TO THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES THESE TREEROOTS WOULD DO THEM GOOD HE STRETCHED WAKE UP HOBBITS HE CRIED ITS A BEAUTIFUL MORNING
WHATS BEAUTIFUL ABOUT IT SAID PIPPIN PEERING OVER THE EDGE OF HIS BLANKET WITH ONE EYE SAM GEL BREAKFAST READY FOR HALFPAST NINE HAVE YOU GOT THE BATHWATER HOT
SAM JUMPED UP LOOKING RATHER BLEARY NO SIR I HAVENT SIR HE SAID
FRODO STRIPPED THE BLANKETS FROM PIPPIN AND ROLLED HIM OVER AND THEN WALKED OFF TO THE EDGE OF THE WOOD AWAY EASTWARD THE SUN WAS RISING RED OUT OF THE MISTS THAT LAY THICK ON THE WORLD TOUCHED WITH GOLD AND RED THE AUTUMN TREES SEEMED TO BE SAILING ROOTLESS IN A SHADOWY SEA A LITTLE BELOW HIM TO THE LEFT THE ROAD RAN DOWN STEEPLY INTO A HOLLOW AND DISAPPEARED
WHEN HE RETURNED SAM AND PIPPIN HAD GOT A GOOD FIRE GOING WATER SHOUTED PIPPIN WHERES THE WATER
I DONT KEEP WATER IN MY POCKETS SAID FRODO WE THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE TO FIND SOME SAID PIPPIN BUSY SETTING OUT THE FOOD AND CUPS YOU HAD BETTER GO NOW
YOU CAN COME TOO SAID FRODO AND BRING ALL THE WATERBOTTLES THERE WAS A STREAM AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL THEY FILLED THEIR BOTTLES AND THE SMALL CAMPING KETTLE AT A LITTLE FALL WHERE THE WATER FELL A FEW FEET OVER AN OUTCROP OF GREY STONE IT WAS ICY COLD AND THEY SPLUTTERED AND PUFFED AS THEY BATHED THEIR FACES AND HANDS
WHEN THEIR BREAKFAST WAS OVER AND THEIR PACKS ALL TRUSSED UP AGAIN IT WAS AFTER TEN OCLOCK AND THE DAY WAS BEGINNING TO TURN FINE AND HOT THEY WENT DOWN THE SLOPE AND ACROSS THE STREAM WHERE IT DIVED UNDER THE ROAD AND UP THE NEXT SLOPE AND UP AND DOWN ANOTHER SHOULDER OF THE HILLS AND BY THAT TIME THEIR CLOAKS BLANKETS WATER FOOD AND OTHER GEAR ALREADY SEEMED A HEAVY BURDEN
THE DAYS MARCH PROMISED TO BE WARM AND TIRING WORK AFTER SOME MILES HOWEVER THE ROAD CEASED TO ROLL UP AND DOWN IT CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A STEEP BANK IN A WEARY ZIGZAGGING SORT OF WAY AND THEN PREPARED TO GO DOWN FOR THE LAST TIME IN FRONT OF THEM THEY SAW THE LOWER LANDS DOTTED WITH SMALL CLUMPS OF TREES THAT MELTED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TO A BROWN WOODLAND HAZE THEY WERE LOOKING ACROSS THE WOODY END TOWARDS THE BRANDYWINE RIVER THE ROAD WOUND AWAY BEFORE THEM LIKE A PIECE OF STRING
THE ROAD GOES ON FOR EVER SAID PIPPIN BUT I CANT WITHOUT A REST IT IS HIGH TIME FOR LUNCH HE SAT DOWN ON THE BANK AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND LOOKED AWAY EAST INTO THE HAZE BEYOND WHICH LAY THE RIVER AND THE END OF THE SHIRE IN WHICH HE HAD SPENT ALL HIS LIFE SAM STOOD BY HIM HIS ROUND EYES WERE WIDE OPEN  FOR HE WAS LOOKING ACROSS LANDS HE HAD NEVER SEEN TO A NEW HORIZON
DO ELVES LIVE IN THOSE WOODS HE ASKED
NOT THAT I EVER HEARD SAID PIPPIN FRODO WAS SILENT HE TOO WAS GAZING EASTWARD ALONG THE ROAD AS IF HE HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE SUDDENLY HE SPOKE ALOUD BUT AS IF TO HIMSELF SAYING SLOWLY
THE ROAD GOES EVER ON AND ON
DOWN FROM THE DOOR WHERE IT BEGAN
NOW FAR AHEAD THE ROAD HAS GONE
AND I MUST FOLLOW IF I CAN
PURSUING IT WITH WEARY FEET
UNTIL IT JOINS SOME LARGER WAY
WHERE MANY PATHS AND ERRANDS MEET
AND WHITHER THEN I CANNOT SAY

THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF OLD BILBOS RHYMING SAID PIPPIN OR IS IT ONE OF YOUR IMITATIONS IT DOES NOT SOUND ALTOGETHER ENCOURAGING
I DONT KNOW SAID FRODO IT CAME TO ME THEN AS IF I WAS MAKING IT UP BUT I MAY HAVE HEARD IT LONG AGO CERTAINLY IT REMINDS ME VERY MUCH OF BILBO IN THE LAST YEARS BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE USED OFTEN TO SAY THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROAD THAT IT WAS LIKE A GREAT RIVER ITS SPRINGS WERE AT EVERY DOORSTEP AND EVERY PATH WAS ITS TRIBUTARY ITS A DANGEROUS BUSINESS FRODO GOING OUT OF YOUR DOOR HE USED TO SAY YOU STEP INTO THE ROAD AND IF YOU DONT KEEP YOUR FEET THERE IS NO KNOWING WHERE YOU MIGHT BE SWEPT OFF TO DO YOU REALIZE THAT THIS IS THE VERY PATH THAT GOES THROUGH MIRKWOOD AND THAT IF YOU LET IT IT MIGHT TAKE YOU TO THE LONELY MOUNTAIN OR EVEN FURTHER AND TO WORSE PLACES HE USED TO SAY THAT ON THE PATH OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR AT BAG END ESPECIALLY AFTER HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A LONG WALK
WELL THE ROAD WONT SWEEP ME ANYWHERE FOR AN HOUR AT LEAST SAID PIPPIN UNSLINGING HIS PACK THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE PUTTING THEIR PACKS AGAINST THE BANK AND THEIR LEGS OUT INTO THE ROAD AFTER A REST THEY HAD A GOOD LUNCH AND THEN MORE REST
THE SUN WAS BEGINNING TO GET LOW AND THE LIGHT OF AFTERNOON WAS ON THE LAND AS THEY WENT DOWN THE HILL SO FAR THEY HAD NOT MET A SOUL ON THE ROAD THIS WAY WAS NOT MUCH USED BEING HARDLY FIT FOR CARTS AND THERE WAS LITTLE TRAFFIC TO THE WOODY END THEY HAD BEEN JOGGING ALONG AGAIN FOR AN HOUR OR MORE WHEN SAM STOPPED A MOMENT AS IF LISTENING THEY WERE NOW ON LEVEL GROUND AND THE ROAD AFTER MUCH WINDING LAY STRAIGHT AHEAD THROUGH GRASSLAND SPRINKLED WITH TALL TREES OUTLIERS OF THE APPROACHING WOODS
I CAN HEAR A PONY OR A HORSE COMING ALONG THE ROAD BEHIND SAID SAM
THEY LOOKED BACK BUT THE TURN OF THE ROAD PREVENTED THEM FROM SEEING FAR I WONDER IF THAT IS GANDALF COMING AFTER US SAID FRODO BUT EVEN AS HE SAID IT HE HAD A FEELING THAT IT WAS NOT SO AND A SUDDEN DESIRE TO HIDE FROM THE VIEW OF THE RIDER CAME OVER HIM
IT MAY NOT MATTER MUCH HE SAID APOLOGETICALLY BUT I WOULD RATHER NOT BE SEEN ON THE ROAD  BY ANYONE I AM SICK OF MY DOINGS BEING NOTICED AND DISCUSSED AND IF IT IS GANDALF HE ADDED AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT WE CAN GIVE HIM A LITTLE SURPRISE TO PAY HIM OUT FOR BEING SO LATE LETS GET OUT OF SIGHT
THE OTHER TWO RAN QUICKLY TO THE LEFT AND DOWN INTO A LITTLE HOLLOW NOT FAR FROM THE ROAD THERE THEY LAY FLAT FRODO HESITATED FOR A SECOND CURIOSITY OR SOME OTHER FEELING WAS STRUGGLING WITH HIS DESIRE TO HIDE THE SOUND OF HOOFS DREW NEARER JUST IN TIME HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN IN A PATCH OF LONG GRASS BEHIND A TREE THAT OVERSHADOWED THE ROAD THEN HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND PEERED CAUTIOUSLY ABOVE ONE OF THE GREAT ROOTS
ROUND THE CORNER CAME A BLACK HORSE NO HOBBITPONY BUT A FULLSIZED HORSE AND ON IT SAT A LARGE MAN WHO SEEMED TO CROUCH IN THE SADDLE WRAPPED IN A GREAT BLACK CLOAK AND HOOD SO THAT ONLY HIS BOOTS IN THE HIGH STIRRUPS SHOWED BELOW HIS FACE WAS SHADOWED AND INVISIBLE
WHEN IT REACHED THE TREE AND WAS LEVEL WITH FRODO THE HORSE STOPPED THE RIDING FIGURE SAT QUITE STILL WITH ITS HEAD BOWED AS IF LISTENING FROM INSIDE THE HOOD CAME A NOISE AS OF SOMEONE SNIFFING TO CATCH AN ELUSIVE SCENT THE HEAD TURNED FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE ROAD
A SUDDEN UNREASONING FEAR OF DISCOVERY LAID HOLD OF FRODO AND HE THOUGHT OF HIS RING HE HARDLY DARED TO BREATHE AND YET THE DESIRE TO GET IT OUT OF HIS POCKET BECAME SO STRONG THAT HE BEGAN SLOWLY TO MOVE HIS HAND HE FELT THAT HE HAD ONLY TO SLIP IT ON AND THEN HE WOULD BE SAFE THE ADVICE OF GANDALF SEEMED ABSURD BILBO HAD USED THE RING AND I AM STILL IN THE SHIRE HE THOUGHT AS HIS HAND TOUCHED THE CHAIN ON WHICH IT HUNG AT THAT MOMENT THE RIDER SAT UP AND SHOOK THE REINS THE HORSE STEPPED FORWARD WALKING SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN BREAKING INTO A QUICK TROT
FRODO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE ROAD AND WATCHED THE RIDER UNTIL HE DWINDLED INTO THE DISTANCE HE COULD NOT BE QUITE SURE BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SUDDENLY BEFORE IT PASSED OUT OF SIGHT THE HORSE TURNED ASIDE AND WENT INTO THE TREES ON THE RIGHT
WELL I CALL THAT VERY QUEER AND INDEED DISTURBING SAID FRODO TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED TOWARDS HIS COMPANIONS PIPPIN AND SAM HAD REMAINED FLAT IN THE GRASS AND HAD SEEN NOTHING SO FRODO DESCRIBED THE RIDER AND HIS STRANGE BEHAVIOUR
I CANT SAY WHY BUT I FELT CERTAIN HE WAS LOOKING OR SMELLING FOR ME AND ALSO I FELT CERTAIN THAT I DID NOT WANT HIM TO DISCOVER ME IVE NEVER SEEN OR FELL ANYTHING LIKE IT IN THE SHIRE BEFORE
BUT WHAT HAS ONE OF THE BIG PEOPLE GOT TO DO WITH US SAID PIPPIN AND WHAT IS HE DOING IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
THERE ARE SOME MEN ABOUT SAID FRODO DOWN IN THE SOUTHFARTHING THEY HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH BIG PEOPLE I BELIEVE BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS RIDER I WONDER WHERE HE COMES FROM
BEGGING YOUR PARDON PUT IN SAM SUDDENLY I KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM ITS FROM HOBBITON THAT THIS HERE BLACK RIDER COMES UNLESS THERES MORE THAN ONE AND I KNOW WHERE HES GOING TO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID FRODO SHARPLY LOOKING AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT WHY DIDNT YOU SPEAK UP BEFORE
I HAVE ONLY JUST REMEMBERED SIR IT WAS LIKE THIS WHEN I GOT BACK TO OUR HOLE YESTERDAY EVENING WITH THE KEY MY DAD HE SAYS TO ME HELLO SAM HE SAYS I THOUGHT YOU WERE AWAY WITH MR FRODO THIS MORNING THERES BEEN A STRANGE CUSTOMER ASKING FOR MR BAGGINS OF BAG END AND HES ONLY JUST GONE IVE SENT HIM ON TO BUCKLEBURY NOT THAT I LIKED THE SOUND OF HIM HE SEEMED MIGHTY PUT OUT WHEN I TOLD HIM MR BAGGINS HAD LEFT HIS OLD HOME FOR GOOD HISSED AT ME HE DID IT GAVE ME QUITE A SHUDDER WHAT SORT OF A FELLOW WAS HE SAYS I TO THE GAFFER I DONT KNOW SAYS HE BUT HE WASNT A HOBBIT HE WAS TALL AND BLACKLIKE AND HE STOOPED OVER ME I RECKON IT WAS ONE OF THE BIG FOLK FROM FOREIGN PARTS HE SPOKE FUNNY
I COULDNT STAY TO HEAR MORE SIR SINCE YOU WERE WAITING AND I DIDNT GIVE MUCH HEED TO IT MYSELF THE GAFFER IS GETTING OLD AND MORE THAN A BIT BLIND AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEAR DARK WHEN THIS FELLOW COME UP THE HILL AND FOUND HIM TAKING THE AIR AT THE END OF OUR ROW I HOPE HE HASNT DONE NO HARM SIR NOR ME
THE GAFFER CANT BE BLAMED ANYWAY SAID FRODO AS A MATTER OF FACT I HEARD HIM TALKING TO A STRANGER WHO SEEMED TO BE INQUIRING FOR ME AND I NEARLY WENT AND ASKED HIM WHO IT WAS I WISH I HAD OR YOU HAD TOLD ME ABOUT IT BEFORE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL ON THE ROAD
STILL THERE MAY BE NO CONNEXION BETWEEN THIS RIDER AND THE GAFFERS STRANGER SAID PIPPIN WE LEFT HOBBITON SECRETLY ENOUGH AND I DONT SEE HOW HE COULD HAVE FOLLOWED US
WHAT ABOUT THE SMELLING SIR SAID SAM AND THE GAFFER SAID HE WAS A BLACK CHAP
I WISH I HAD WAITED FOR GANDALF FRODO MUTTERED BUT PERHAPS IT WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE MATTERS WORSE
THEN YOU KNOW OR GUESS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RIDER SAID PIPPIN WHO HAD CAUGHT THE MUTTERED WORDS
I DONT KNOW AND I WOULD RATHER NOT GUESS SAID FRODO
ALL RIGHT COUSIN FRODO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR SECRET FOR THE PRESENT IF YOU WANT TO BE MYSTERIOUS IN THE MEANWHILE WHAT ARE WE TO DO I SHOULD LIKE A BITE AND A SUP BUT SOMEHOW I THINK WE HAD BETTER MOVE ON FROM HERE YOUR TALK OF SNIFFING RIDERS WITH INVISIBLE NOSES HAS UNSETTLED ME
YES I THINK WE WILL MOVE ON NOW SAID FRODO BUT NOT ON THE ROAD IN CASE THAT RIDER COMES BACK OR ANOTHER FOLLOWS HIM WE OUGHT TO DO A GOOD STEP MORE TODAY BUCKLAND IS STILL MILES AWAY
THE SHADOWS OF THE TREES WERE LONG AND THIN ON THE GRASS AS THEY STARTED OFF AGAIN THEY NOW KEPT A STONES THROW TO THE LEFT OF THE ROAD AND KEPT OUT OF SIGHT OF IT AS MUCH AS THEY COULD BUT THIS HINDERED THEM FOR THE GRASS WAS THICK AND TUSSOCKY AND THE GROUND UNEVEN AND THE TREES BEGAN TO DRAW TOGETHER INTO THICKETS
THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN RED BEHIND THE HILLS AT THEIR BACKS AND EVENING WAS COMING ON BEFORE THEY CAME BACK TO THE ROAD AT THE END OF THE LONG LEVEL OVER WHICH IT HAD RUN STRAIGHT FOR SOME MILES AT THAT POINT IT BENT LEFT AND WENT DOWN INTO THE LOWLANDS OF THE YALE MAKING FOR STOCK BUT A LANE BRANCHED RIGHT WINDING THROUGH A WOOD OF ANCIENT OAKTREES ON ITS WAY TO WOODHALL THAT IS THE WAY FOR US SAID FRODO
NOT FAR FROM THE ROADMEETING THEY CAME ON THE HUGE HULK OF A TREE IT WAS STILL ALIVE AND HAD LEAVES ON THE SMALL BRANCHES THAT IT HAD PUT OUT ROUND THE BROKEN STUMPS OF ITS LONGFALLEN LIMBS BUT IT WAS HOLLOW AND COULD BE ENTERED BY A GREAT CRACK ON THE SIDE AWAY FROM THE ROAD THE HOBBITS CREPT INSIDE AND SAT THERE UPON A FLOOR OF OLD LEAVES AND DECAYED WOOD THEY RESTED AND HAD A LIGHT MEAL TALKING QUIETLY AND LISTENING FROM TIME TO TIME
TWILIGHT WAS ABOUT THEM AS THEY CREPT BACK TO THE LANE THE WEST WIND WAS SIGHING IN THE BRANCHES LEAVES WERE WHISPERING SOON THE ROAD BEGAN TO FALL GENTLY BUT STEADILY INTO THE DUSK A STAR CAME OUT ABOVE THE TREES IN THE DARKENING EAST BEFORE THEM THEY WENT ABREAST AND IN STEP TO KEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS AFTER A TIME AS THE STARS GREW THICKER AND BRIGHTER THE FEELING OF DISQUIET LEFT THEM AND THEY NO LONGER LISTENED FOR THE SOUND OF HOOFS THEY BEGAN TO HUM SOFTLY AS HOBBITS HAVE A WAY OF DOING AS THEY WALK ALONG ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE DRAWING NEAR TO HOME AT NIGHT WITH MOST HOBBITS IT IS A SUPPERSONG OR A BEDSONG BUT THESE HOBBITS HUMMED A WALKINGSONG THOUGH NOT OF COURSE WITHOUT ANY MENTION OF SUPPER AND BED BILBO BAGGINS HAD MADE THE WORDS TO A TUNE THAT WAS AS OLD AS THE HILLS AND TAUGHT IT TO FRODO AS THEY WALKED IN THE LANES OF THE WATERVALLEY AND TALKED ABOUT ADVENTURE
UPON THE HEARTH THE FIRE IS RED
BENEATH THE ROOF THERE IS A BED
BUT NOT YET WEARY ARE OUR FEET
STILL ROUND THE CORNER WE MAY MEET
A SUDDEN TREE OR STANDING STONE
THAT NONE HAVE SEEN BUT WE ALONE

TREE AND FLOWER AND LEAF AND GRASS
LET THEM PASS LET THEM PASS
HILL AND WATER UNDER SKY
PASS THEM BY PASS THEM BY

STILL ROUND THE CORNER THERE MAY WAIT
A NEW ROAD OR A SECRET GATE
AND THOUGH WE PASS THEM BY TODAY
TOMORROW WE MAY COME THIS WAY
AND TAKE THE HIDDEN PATHS THAT RUN
TOWARDS THE MOON OR TO THE SUN

APPLE THORN AND NUT AND SLOE
LET THEM GO LET THEM GO
SAND AND STONE AND POOL AND DELL
FARE YOU WELL FARE YOU WELL

HOME IS BEHIND THE WORLD AHEAD
AND THERE ARE MANY PATHS TO TREAD
THROUGH SHADOWS TO THE EDGE OF NIGHT
UNTIL THE STARS ARE ALL ALIGHT
THEN WORLD BEHIND AND HOME AHEAD
WELL WANDER BACK TO HOME AND BED

MIST AND TWILIGHT CLOUD AND SHADE
AWAY SHALL FADE AWAY SHALL FADE
FIRE AND LAMP AND MEAT AND BREAD
AND THEN TO BED AND THEN TO BED

THE SONG ENDED AND NOW TO BED AND NOW TO BED SANG PIPPIN IN A HIGH VOICE
HUSH SAID FRODO I THINK I HEAR HOOFS AGAIN
THEY SLOPPED SUDDENLY AND STOOD AS SILENT AS TREESHADOWS LISTENING THERE WAS A SOUND OF HOOFS IN THE LANE SOME WAY BEHIND BUT COMING SLOW AND CLEAR DOWN THE WIND QUICKLY AND QUIETLY THEY SLIPPED OFF THE PATH AND RAN INTO THE DEEPER SHADE UNDER THE OAKTREES
DONT LET US GO TOO FAR SAID FRODO I DONT WANT TO BE SEEN BUT I WANT TO SEE IF IT IS ANOTHER BLACK RIDER
VERY WELL SAID PIPPIN BUT DONT FORGET THE SNIFFING
THE HOOFS DREW NEARER THEY HAD NO TIME TO FIND ANY HIDINGPLACE BETTER THAN THE GENERAL DARKNESS UNDER THE TREES SAM AND PIPPIN CROUCHED BEHIND A LARGE TREEBOLE WHILE FRODO CREPT BACK A FEW YARDS TOWARDS THE LANE IT SHOWED GREY AND PALE A LINE OF FADING LIGHT THROUGH THE WOOD ABOVE IT THE STARS WERE THICK IN THE DIM SKY BUT THERE WAS NO MOON
THE SOUND OF HOOFS STOPPED AS FRODO WATCHED HE SAW SOMETHING DARK PASS ACROSS THE LIGHTER SPACE BETWEEN TWO TREES AND THEN HALT IT LOOKED LIKE THE BLACK SHADE OF A HORSE LED BY A SMALLER BLACK SHADOW THE BLACK SHADOW STOOD CLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THE PATH AND IT SWAYED FROM SIDE TO SIDE FRODO THOUGHT HE HEARD THE SOUND OF SNUFFLING THE SHADOW BENT TO THE GROUND AND THEN BEGAN TO CRAWL TOWARDS HIM
ONCE MORE THE DESIRE TO SLIP ON THE RING CAME OVER FRODO BUT THIS TIME IT WAS STRONGER THAN BEFORE SO STRONG THAT ALMOST BEFORE HE REALIZED WHAT HE WAS DOING HIS HAND WAS GROPING IN HIS POCKET BUT AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A SOUND LIKE MINGLED SONG AND LAUGHTER CLEAR VOICES ROSE AND FELL IN THE STARLIT AIR THE BLACK SHADOW STRAIGHTENED UP AND RETREATED IT CLIMBED ON TO THE SHADOWY HORSE AND SEEMED TO VANISH ACROSS THE LANE INTO THE DARKNESS ON THE OTHER SIDE FRODO BREATHED AGAIN
ELVES EXCLAIMED SAM IN A HOARSE WHISPER ELVES SIR HE WOULD HAVE BURST OUT OF THE TREES AND DASHED OFF TOWARDS THE VOICES IF THEY HAD NOT PULLED HIM BACK
YES IT IS ELVES SAID FRODO ONE CAN MEET THEM SOMETIMES IN THE WOODY END THEY DONT LIVE IN THE SHIRE BUT THEY WANDER INTO IT IN SPRING AND AUTUMN OUT OF THEIR OWN LANDS AWAY BEYOND THE TOWER HILLS I AM THANKFUL THAT THEY DO YOU DID NOT SEE BUT THAT BLACK RIDER STOPPED JUST HERE AND WAS ACTUALLY CRAWLING TOWARDS US WHEN THE SONG BEGAN AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE VOICES HE SLIPPED AWAY
WHAT ABOUT THE ELVES SAID SAM TOO EXCITED TO TROUBLE ABOUT THE RIDER CANT WE GO AND SEE THEM
LISTEN THEY ARE COMING THIS WAY SAID FRODO WE HAVE ONLY TO WAIT THE SINGING DREW NEARER ONE CLEAR VOICE ROSE NOW ABOVE THE OTHERS IT WAS SINGING IN THE FAIR ELVENTONGUE OF WHICH FRODO KNEW ONLY A LITTLE AND THE OTHERS KNEW NOTHING YET THE SOUND BLENDING WITH THE MELODY SEEMED TO SHAPE ITSELF IN THEIR THOUGHT INTO WORDS WHICH THEY ONLY PARTLY UNDERSTOOD THIS WAS THE SONG AS FRODO HEARD IT
SNOWWHITE SNOWWHITE O LADY CLEAR
O QUEEN BEYOND THE WESTERN SEAS
O LIGHT TO US THAT WANDER HERE
AMID THE WORLD OF WOVEN TREES

GILTHONIEL O ELBERETH
CLEAR ARE THY EYES AND BRIGHT THY BREATH
SNOWWHITE SNOWWHITE WE SING TO THEE
IN A FAR LAND BEYOND THE SEA

O STARS THAT IN THE SUNLESS YEAR
WITH SHINING HAND BY HER WERE SAWN
IN WINDY FIELDS NOW BRIGHT AND CLEAR
WE SEE YOUR SILVER BLOSSOM BLOWN

O ELBERETH GILTHONIEL
WE STILL REMEMBER WE WHO DWELL
IN THIS FAR LAND BENEATH THE TREES
THY STARLIGHT ON THE WESTERN SEAS

THE SONG ENDED THESE ARE HIGH ELVES THEY SPOKE THE NAME OF ELBERETH SAID FRODO IN AMAZEMENT FEW OF THAT FAIREST FOLK ARE EVER SEEN IN THE SHIRE NOT MANY NOW REMAIN IN MIDDLEEARTH EAST OF THE GREAT SEA THIS IS INDEED A STRANGE CHANCE
THE HOBBITS SAT IN SHADOW BY THE WAYSIDE BEFORE LONG THE ELVES CAME DOWN THE LANE TOWARDS THE VALLEY THEY PASSED SLOWLY AND THE HOBBITS COULD SEE THE STARLIGHT GLIMMERING ON THEIR HAIR AND IN THEIR EYES THEY BORE NO LIGHTS YET AS THEY WALKED A SHIMMER LIKE THE LIGHT OF THE MOON ABOVE THE RIM OF THE HILLS BEFORE IT RISES SEEMED TO FALL ABOUT THEIR FEET THEY WERE NOW SILENT AND AS THE LAST ELF PASSED HE TURNED AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE HOBBITS AND LAUGHED
HAIL FRODO HE CRIED YOU ARE ABROAD LATE OR ARE YOU PERHAPS LOST THEN HE CALLED ALOUD TO THE OTHERS AND ALL THE COMPANY STOPPED AND GATHERED ROUND
THIS IS INDEED WONDERFUL THEY SAID THREE HOBBITS IN A WOOD AT NIGHT WE HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH A THING SINCE BILBO WENT AWAY WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT
THE MEANING OF IT FAIR PEOPLE SAID FRODO IS SIMPLY THAT WE SEEM TO BE GOING THE SAME WAY AS YOU ARE I LIKE WALKING UNDER THE STARS BUT I WOULD WELCOME YOUR COMPANY
BUT WE HAVE NO NEED OF OTHER COMPANY AND HOBBITS ARE SO DULL THEY LAUGHED AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WE GO THE SAME WAY AS YOU FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHITHER WE ARE GOING
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME ASKED FRODO IN RETURN
WE KNOW MANY THINGS THEY SAID WE HAVE SEEN YOU OFTEN BEFORE WITH BILBO THOUGH YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN US
WHO ARE YOU AND WHO IS YOUR LORD ASKED FRODO
I AM GILDOR ANSWERED THEIR LEADER THE ELF WHO HAD FIRST HAILED HIM GILDOR INGLORION OF THE HOUSE OF FINROD WE ARE EXILES AND MOST OF OUR KINDRED HAVE LONG AGO DEPARTED AND WE TOO ARE NOW ONLY TARRYING HERE A WHILE ERE WE RETURN OVER THE GREAT SEA BUT SOME OF OUR KINSFOLK DWELL STILL IN PEACE IN RIVENDELL COME NOW FRODO TELL US WHAT YOU ARE DOING FOR WE SEE THAT THERE IS SOME SHADOW OF FEAR UPON YOU
O WISE PEOPLE INTERRUPTED PIPPIN EAGERLY TELL US ABOUT THE BLACK RIDERS
BLACK RIDERS THEY SAID IN LOW VOICES WHY DO YOU ASK ABOUT BLACK RIDERS
BECAUSE TWO BLACK RIDERS HAVE OVERTAKEN US TODAY OR ONE HAS DONE SO TWICE SAID PIPPIN ONLY A LITTLE WHILE AGO HE SLIPPED AWAY AS YOU DREW NEAR
THE ELVES DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE BUT SPOKE TOGETHER SOFTLY IN THEIR OWN TONGUE AT LENGTH GILDOR TURNED TO THE HOBBITS WE WILL NOT SPEAK OF THIS HERE HE SAID WE THINK YOU HAD BEST COME NOW WITH US IT IS NOT OUR CUSTOM BUT FOR THIS TIME WE WILL LAKE YOU ON OUR ROAD AND YOU SHALL LODGE WITH US TONIGHT IF YOU WILL
O FAIR FOLK THIS IS GOOD FORTUNE BEYOND MY HOPE SAID PIPPIN SAM WAS SPEECHLESS I THANK YOU INDEED GILDOR INGLORION SAID FRODO BOWING ELEN SILA LUMENN OMENTIELVO A STAR SHINES ON THE HOUR OF OUR MEETING HE ADDED IN THE HIGHELVEN SPEECH
BE CAREFUL FRIENDS CRIED GILDOR LAUGHING SPEAK NO SECRETS HERE IS A SCHOLAR IN THE ANCIENT TONGUE BILBO WAS A GOOD MASTER HAIL ELFFRIEND HE SAID BOWING TO FRODO COME NOW WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND JOIN OUR COMPANY YOU HAD BEST WALK IN THE MIDDLE SO THAT YOU MAY NOT STRAY YOU MAY BE WEARY BEFORE WE HALT
WHY WHERE ARE YOU GOING ASKED FRODO
FOR TONIGHT WE GO TO THE WOODS ON THE HILLS ABOVE WOODHALL IT IS SOME MILES BUT YOU SHALL HAVE REST AT THE END OF IT AND IT WILL SHORTEN YOUR JOURNEY TOMORROW
THEY NOW MARCHED ON AGAIN IN SILENCE AND PASSED LIKE SHADOWS AND FAINT LIGHTS FOR ELVES EVEN MORE THAN HOBBITS COULD WALK WHEN THEY WISHED WITHOUT SOUND OF FOOTFALL PIPPIN SOON BEGAN TO FEEL SLEEPY AND STAGGERED ONCE OR TWICE BUT EACH TIME A TALL ELF AT HIS SIDE PUT OUT HIS ARM AND SAVED HIM FROM A FALL SAM WALKED ALONG AT FRODOS SIDE AS IF IN A DREAM WITH AN EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE HALF OF FEAR AND HALF OF ASTONISHED JOY
THE WOODS ON EITHER SIDE BECAME DENSER THE TREES WERE NOW YOUNGER AND THICKER AND AS THE LANE WENT LOWER RUNNING DOWN INTO A FOLD OF THE HILLS THERE WERE MANY DEEP BRAKES OF HAZEL ON THE RISING SLOPES AT EITHER HAND AT LAST THE ELVES TURNED ASIDE FROM THE PATH A GREEN RIDE LAY ALMOST UNSEEN THROUGH THE THICKETS ON THE RIGHT AND THIS THEY FOLLOWED AS IT WOUND AWAY BACK UP THE WOODED SLOPES ON TO THE TOP OF A SHOULDER OF THE HILLS THAT STOOD OUT INTO THE LOWER LAND OF THE RIVERVALLEY SUDDENLY THEY CAME OUT OF THE SHADOW OF THE TREES AND BEFORE THEM LAY A WIDE SPACE OF GRASS GREY UNDER THE NIGHT ON THREE SIDES THE WOODS PRESSED UPON IT BUT EASTWARD THE GROUND FELL STEEPLY AND THE TOPS OF THE DARK TREES GROWING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE WERE BELOW THEIR FEET BEYOND THE LOW LANDS LAY DIM AND FLAT UNDER THE STARS NEARER AT HAND A FEW LIGHTS TWINKLED IN THE VILLAGE OF WOODHALL
THE ELVES SAT ON THE GRASS AND SPOKE TOGETHER IN SOFT VOICES THEY SEEMED TO TAKE NO FURTHER NOTICE OF THE HOBBITS FRODO AND HIS COMPANIONS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN CLOAKS AND BLANKETS AND DROWSINESS STOLE OVER THEM THE NIGHT GREW ON AND THE LIGHTS IN THE VALLEY WENT OUT PIPPIN FELL ASLEEP PILLOWED ON A GREEN HILLOCK
AWAY HIGH IN THE EAST SWUNG REMMIRATH THE NETTED STARS AND SLOWLY ABOVE THE MISTS RED BORGIL ROSE GLOWING LIKE A JEWEL OF FIRE THEN BY SOME SHIFT OF AIRS ALL THE MIST WAS DRAWN AWAY LIKE A VEIL AND THERE LEANED UP AS HE CLIMBED OVER THE RIM OF THE WORLD THE SWORDSMAN OF THE SKY MENELVAGOR WITH HIS SHINING BELT THE ELVES ALL BURST INTO SONG SUDDENLY UNDER THE TREES A FIRE SPRANG UP WITH A RED LIGHT
COME THE ELVES CALLED TO THE HOBBITS COME NOW IS THE TIME FOR SPEECH AND MERRIMENT
PIPPIN SAT UP AND RUBBED HIS EYES HE SHIVERED THERE IS A FIRE IN THE HALL AND FOOD FOR HUNGRY GUESTS SAID AN ELF STANDING BEFORE HIM
AT THE SOUTH END OF THE GREENSWARD THERE WAS AN OPENING THERE THE GREEN FLOOR RAN ON INTO THE WOOD AND FORMED A WIDE SPACE LIKE A HALL ROOFED BY THE BOUGHS OF TREES THEIR GREAT TRUNKS RAN LIKE PILLARS DOWN EACH SIDE IN THE MIDDLE THERE WAS A WOODFIRE BLAZING AND UPON THE TREEPILLARS TORCHES WITH LIGHTS OF GOLD AND SILVER WERE BURNING STEADILY THE ELVES SAT ROUND THE FIRE UPON THE GRASS OR UPON THE SAWN RINGS OF OLD TRUNKS SOME WENT TO AND FRO BEARING CUPS AND POURING DRINK OTHERS BROUGHT FOOD ON HEAPED PLATES AND DISHES

THIS IS POOR FARE THEY SAID TO THE HOBBITS FOR WE ARE LODGING IN THE GREENWOOD FAR FROM OUR HALLS IF EVER YOU ARE OUR GUESTS AT HOME WE WILL TREAT YOU BETTER
IT SEEMS TO ME GOOD ENOUGH FOR A BIRTHDAYPARTY SAID FRODO
PIPPIN AFTERWARDS RECALLED LITTLE OF EITHER FOOD OR DRINK FOR HIS MIND WAS FILLED WITH THE LIGHT UPON THE ELFFACES AND THE SOUND OF VOICES SO VARIOUS AND SO BEAUTIFUL THAT HE FELT IN A WAKING DREAM BUT HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS BREAD SURPASSING THE SAVOUR OF A FAIR WHITE LOAF TO ONE WHO IS STARVING AND FRUITS SWEET AS WILDBERRIES AND RICHER THAN THE TENDED FRUITS OF GARDENS HE DRAINED A CUP THAT WAS FILLED WITH A FRAGRANT DRAUGHT COOL AS A CLEAR FOUNTAIN GOLDEN AS A SUMMER AFTERNOON
SAM COULD NEVER DESCRIBE IN WORDS NOR PICTURE CLEARLY TO HIMSELF WHAT HE FELT OR THOUGHT THAT NIGHT THOUGH IT REMAINED IN HIS MEMORY AS ONE OF THE CHIEF EVENTS OF HIS LIFE THE NEAREST HE EVER GOT WAS TO SAY WELL SIR IF I COULD GROW APPLES LIKE THAT I WOULD CALL MYSELF A GARDENER BUT IT WAS THE SINGING THAT WENT TO MY HEART IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
FRODO SAT EATING DRINKING AND TALKING WITH DELIGHT BUT HIS MIND WAS CHIEFLY ON THE WORDS SPOKEN HE KNEW A LITTLE OF THE ELFSPEECH AND LISTENED EAGERLY NOW AND AGAIN HE SPOKE TO THOSE THAT SERVED HIM AND THANKED THEM IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE THEY SMILED AT HIM AND SAID LAUGHING HERE IS A JEWEL AMONG HOBBITS
AFTER A WHILE PIPPIN FELL FAST ASLEEP AND WAS LIFTED UP AND BORNE AWAY TO A BOWER UNDER THE TREES THERE HE WAS LAID UPON A SOFT BED AND SLEPT THE REST OF THE NIGHT AWAY SAM REFUSED TO LEAVE HIS MASTER WHEN PIPPIN HAD GONE HE CAME AND SAT CURLED UP AT FRODOS FEET WHERE AT LAST HE NODDED AND CLOSED HIS EYES FRODO REMAINED LONG AWAKE TALKING WITH GILDOR
THEY SPOKE OF MANY THINGS OLD AND NEW AND FRODO QUESTIONED GILDOR MUCH ABOUT HAPPENINGS IN THE WIDE WORLD OUTSIDE THE SHIRE THE TIDINGS WERE MOSTLY SAD AND OMINOUS OF GATHERING DARKNESS THE WARS OF MEN AND THE FLIGHT OF THE ELVES AT LAST FRODO ASKED THE QUESTION THAT WAS NEAREST TO HIS HEART
TELL ME GILDOR HAVE YOU EVER SEEN BILBO SINCE HE LEFT US
GILDOR SMILED YES HE ANSWERED TWICE HE SAID FAREWELL TO US ON THIS VERY SPOT BUT I SAW HIM ONCE AGAIN FAR FROM HERE HE WOULD SAY NO MORE ABOUT BILBO AND FRODO FELL SILENT
YOU DO NOT ASK ME OR TELL ME MUCH THAT CONCERNS YOURSELF FRODO SAID GILDOR BUT I ALREADY KNOW A LITTLE AND I CAN READ MORE IN YOUR FACE AND IN THE THOUGHT BEHIND YOUR QUESTIONS YOU ARE LEAVING THE SHIRE AND YET YOU DOUBT THAT YOU WILL FIND WHAT YOU SEEK OR ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU INTEND OR THAT YOU WILL EVER RETURN IS NOT THAT SO
IT IS SAID FRODO BUT I THOUGHT MY GOING WAS A SECRET KNOWN ONLY TO GANDALF AND MY FAITHFUL SAM HE LOOKED DOWN AT SAM WHO WAS SNORING GENTLY
THE SECRET WILL NOT REACH THE ENEMY FROM US SAID GILDOR
THE ENEMY SAID FRODO THEN YOU KNOW WHY I AM LEAVING THE SHIRE
I DO NOT KNOW FOR WHAT REASON THE ENEMY IS PURSUING YOU ANSWERED GILDOR BUT I PERCEIVE THAT HE IS  STRANGE INDEED THOUGH THAT SEEMS TO ME AND I WARN YOU THAT PERIL IS NOW BOTH BEFORE YOU AND BEHIND YOU AND UPON EITHER SIDE
YOU MEAN THE RIDERS I FEARED THAT THEY WERE SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY WHAT ARE THE BLACK RIDERS
HAS GANDALF TOLD YOU NOTHING
NOTHING ABOUT SUCH CREATURES
THEN I THINK IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY MORE  LEST TERROR SHOULD KEEP YOU FROM YOUR JOURNEY FOR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE SET OUT ONLY JUST IN TIME IF INDEED YOU ARE IN TIME YOU MUST NOW MAKE HASTE AND NEITHER STAY NOR TURN BACK FOR THE SHIRE IS NO LONGER ANY PROTECTION TO YOU
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT INFORMATION COULD BE MORE TERRIFYING THAN YOUR HINTS AND WARNINGS EXCLAIMED FRODO I KNEW THAT DANGER LAY AHEAD OF COURSE BUT I DID NOT EXPECT TO MEET IT IN OUR OWN SHIRE CANT A HOBBIT WALK FROM THE WATER TO THE RIVER IN PEACE
BUT IT IS NOT YOUR OWN SHIRE SAID GILDOR OTHERS DWELT HERE BEFORE HOBBITS WERE AND OTHERS WILL DWELL HERE AGAIN WHEN HOBBITS ARE NO MORE THE WIDE WORLD IS ALL ABOUT YOU YOU CAN FENCE YOURSELVES IN BUT YOU CANNOT FOR EVER FENCE IT OUT
I KNOW  AND YET IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED SO SAFE AND FAMILIAR WHAT CAN I DO NOW MY PLAN WAS TO LEAVE THE SHIRE SECRETLY AND MAKE MY WAY TO RIVENDELL BUT NOW MY FOOTSTEPS ARE DOGGED BEFORE EVER I GET TO BUCKLAND
I THINK YOU SHOULD STILL FOLLOW THAT PLAN SAID GILDOR I DO NOT THINK THE ROAD WILL PROVE TOO HARD FOR YOUR COURAGE BUT IF YOU DESIRE CLEARER COUNSEL YOU SHOULD ASK GANDALF I DO NOT KNOW THE REASON FOR YOUR FLIGHT AND THEREFORE I DO NOT KNOW BY WHAT MEANS YOUR PURSUERS WILL ASSAIL YOU THESE THINGS GANDALF MUST KNOW I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WILL SEE HIM BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE SHIRE
I HOPE SO BUT THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT MAKES ME ANXIOUS I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING GANDALF FOR MANY DAYS HE WAS TO HAVE COME TO HOBBITON AT THE LATEST TWO NIGHTS AGO BUT HE HAS NEVER APPEARED NOW I AM WONDERING WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED SHOULD I WAIT FOR HIM
GILDOR WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT I DO NOT LIKE THIS NEWS HE SAID AT LAST THAT GANDALF SHOULD BE LATE DOES NOT BODE WELL BUT IT IS SAID DO NOT MEDDLE IN THE AFFAIRS OF WIZARDS FOR THEY ARE SUBTLE AND QUICK TO ANGER THE CHOICE IS YOURS TO GO OR WAIT
AND IT IS ALSO SAID ANSWERED FRODO GO NOT TO THE ELVES FOR COUNSEL FOR THEY WILL SAY BOTH NO AND YES
IS IT INDEED LAUGHED GILDOR ELVES SELDOM GIVE UNGUARDED ADVICE FOR ADVICE IS A DANGEROUS GIFT EVEN FROM THE WISE TO THE WISE AND ALL COURSES MAY RUN ILL BUT WHAT WOULD YOU YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME ALL CONCERNING YOURSELF AND HOW THEN SHALL I CHOOSE BETTER THAN YOU BUT IF YOU DEMAND ADVICE I WILL FOR FRIENDSHIPS SAKE GIVE IT I THINK YOU SHOULD NOW GO AT ONCE WITHOUT DELAY AND IF GANDALF DOES NOT COME BEFORE YOU SET OUT THEN I ALSO ADVISE THIS DO NOT GO ALONE TAKE SUCH FRIENDS AS ARE TRUSTY AND WILLING NOW YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR I DO NOT GIVE THIS COUNSEL GLADLY THE ELVES HAVE THEIR OWN LABOURS AND THEIR OWN SORROWS AND THEY ARE LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THE WAYS OF HOBBITS OR OF ANY OTHER CREATURES UPON EARTH OUR PATHS CROSS THEIRS SELDOM BY CHANCE OR PURPOSE IN THIS MEETING THERE MAY BE MORE THAN CHANCE BUT THE PURPOSE IS NOT CLEAR TO ME AND I FEAR TO SAY TOO MUCH
I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL SAID FRODO BUT I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME PLAINLY WHAT THE BLACK RIDERS ARE IF I TAKE YOUR ADVICE I MAY NOT SEE GANDALF FOR A LONG WHILE AND I OUGHT TO KNOW WHAT IS THE DANGER THAT PURSUES ME
IS IT NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY ANSWERED GILDOR FLEE THEM SPEAK NO WORDS TO THEM THEY ARE DEADLY ASK NO MORE OF ME BUT MY HEART FORBODES THAT ERE ALL IS ENDED YOU FRODO SON OF DROGO WILL KNOW MORE OF THESE FELL THINGS THAN GILDOR INGLORION MAY ELBERETH PROTECT YOU
BUT WHERE SHALL I FIND COURAGE ASKED FRODO THAT IS WHAT I CHIEFLY NEED
COURAGE IS FOUND IN UNLIKELY PLACES SAID GILDOR BE OF GOOD HOPE SLEEP NOW IN THE MORNING WE SHALL HAVE GONE BUT WE WILL SEND OUR MESSAGES THROUGH THE LANDS THE WANDERING COMPANIES SHALL KNOW OF YOUR JOURNEY AND THOSE THAT HAVE POWER FOR GOOD SHALL BE ON THE WATCH I NAME YOU ELFFRIEND AND MAY THE STARS SHINE UPON THE END OF YOUR ROAD SELDOM HAVE WE HAD SUCH DELIGHT IN STRANGERS AND IT IS FAIR TO HEAR WORDS OF THE ANCIENT SPEECH FROM THE LIPS OF OTHER WANDERERS IN THE WORLD
FRODO FELT SLEEP COMING UPON HIM EVEN AS GILDOR FINISHED SPEAKING I WILL SLEEP NOW HE SAID AND THE ELF LED HIM TO A BOWER BESIDE PIPPIN AND HE THREW HIMSELF UPON A BED AND FELL AT ONCE INTO A DREAMLESS SLUMBER



CHAPTER 4
A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS

IN THE MORNING FRODO WOKE REFRESHED HE WAS LYING IN A BOWER MADE BY A LIVING TREE WITH BRANCHES LACED AND DROOPING TO THE GROUND HIS BED WAS OF FERN AND GRASS DEEP AND SOFT AND STRANGELY FRAGRANT THE SUN WAS SHINING THROUGH THE FLUTTERING LEAVES WHICH WERE STILL GREEN UPON THE TREE HE JUMPED UP AND WENT OUT
SAM WAS SITTING ON THE GRASS NEAR THE EDGE OF THE WOOD PIPPIN WAS STANDING STUDYING THE SKY AND WEATHER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE ELVES
THEY HAVE LEFT US FRUIT AND DRINK AND BREAD SAID PIPPIN COME AND HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST THE BREAD TASTES ALMOST AS GOOD AS IT DID LAST NIGHT I DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE YOU ANY BUT SAM INSISTED
FRODO SAT DOWN BESIDE SAM AND BEGAN TO EAT WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR TODAY ASKED PIPPIN
TO WALK TO BUCKLEBURY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ANSWERED FRODO AND GAVE HIS ATTENTION TO THE FOOD
DO YOU THINK WE SHALL SEE ANYTHING OF THOSE RIDERS ASKED PIPPIN CHEERFULLY UNDER THE MORNING SUN THE PROSPECT OF SEEING A WHOLE TROOP OF THEM DID NOT SEEM VERY ALARMING TO HIM
YES PROBABLY SAID FRODO NOT LIKING THE REMINDER BUT I HOPE TO GET ACROSS THE RIVER WITHOUT THEIR SEEING US
DID YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT THEM FROM GILDOR
NOT MUCH  ONLY HINTS AND RIDDLES SAID FRODO EVASIVELY
DID YOU ASK ABOUT THE SNIFFING
WE DIDNT DISCUSS IT SAID FRODO WITH HIS MOUTH FULL
YOU SHOULD HAVE I AM SURE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
IN THAT CASE I AM SURE GILDOR WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO EXPLAIN IT SAID FRODO SHARPLY AND NOW LEAVE ME IN PEACE FOR A BIT I DONT WANT TO ANSWER A STRING OF QUESTIONS WHILE I AM EATING I WANT TO THINK
GOOD HEAVENS SAID PIPPIN AT BREAKFAST HE WALKED AWAY TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE GREEN
FROM FRODOS MIND THE BRIGHT MORNING  TREACHEROUSLY BRIGHT HE THOUGHT  HAD NOT BANISHED THE FEAR OF PURSUIT AND HE PONDERED THE WORDS OF GILDOR THE MERRY VOICE OF PIPPIN CAME TO HIM HE WAS RUNNING ON THE GREEN TURF AND SINGING
NO I COULD NOT HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT IS ONE THING TO TAKE MY YOUNG FRIENDS WALKING OVER THE SHIRE WITH ME UNTIL WE ARE HUNGRY AND WEARY AND FOOD AND BED ARE SWEET TO TAKE THEM INTO EXILE WHERE HUNGER AND WEARINESS MAY HAVE NO CURE IS QUITE ANOTHER  EVEN IF THEY ARE WILLING TO COME THE INHERITANCE IS MINE ALONE I DONT THINK I OUGHT EVEN TO TAKE SAM HE LOOKED AT SAM GAMGEE AND DISCOVERED THAT SAM WAS WATCHING HIM
WELL SAM HE SAID WHAT ABOUT IT I AM LEAVING THE SHIRE AS SOON AS EVER I CAN  IN FACT I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND NOW NOT EVEN TO WAIT A DAY AT CRICKHOLLOW IF IT CAN BE HELPED
VERY GOOD SIR
YOU STILL MEAN TO COME WITH ME
I DO
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DANGEROUS SAM IT IS ALREADY DANGEROUS MOST LIKELY NEITHER OF US WILL COME BACK
IF YOU DONT COME BACK SIR THEN I SHANT THATS CERTAIN SAID SAM DONT YOU LEAVE HIM THEY SAID TO ME LEAVE HIM I SAID I NEVER MEAN TO I AM GOING WITH HIM IF HE CLIMBS TO THE MOON AND IF ANY OF THOSE BLACK RIDERS TRY TO STOP HIM THEYLL HAVE SAM GAMGEE TO RECKON WITH I SAID THEY LAUGHED
WHO ARE THEY AND WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THE ELVES SIR WE HAD SOME TALK LAST NIGHT AND THEY SEEMED TO KNOW YOU WERE GOING AWAY SO I DIDNT SEE THE USE OF DENYING IT WONDERFUL FOLK ELVES SIR WONDERFUL
THEY ARE SAID FRODO DO YOU LIKE THEM STILL NOW YOU HAVE HAD A CLOSER VIEW
THEY SEEM A BIT ABOVE MY LIKES AND DISLIKES SO TO SPEAK ANSWERED SAM SLOWLY IT DONT SEEM TO MATTER WHAT I THINK ABOUT THEM THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I EXPECTED  SO OLD AND YOUNG AND SO GAY AND SAD AS IT WERE
FRODO LOOKED AT SAM RATHER STARTLED HALF EXPECTING TO SEE SOME OUTWARD SIGN OF THE ODD CHANGE THAT SEEMED TO HAVE COME OVER HIM IT DID NOT SOUND LIKE THE VOICE OF THE OLD SAM GAMGEE THAT HE THOUGHT HE KNEW BUT IT LOOKED LIKE THE OLD SAM GAMGEE SITTING THERE EXCEPT THAT HIS FACE WAS UNUSUALLY THOUGHTFUL
DO YOU FEEL ANY NEED TO LEAVE THE SHIRE NOW  NOW THAT YOUR WISH TO SEE THEM HAS COME TRUE ALREADY HE ASKED
YES SIR I DONT KNOW HOW TO SAY IT BUT AFTER LAST NIGHT I FEEL DIFFERENT I SEEM TO SEE AHEAD IN A KIND OF WAY I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY LONG ROAD INTO DARKNESS BUT I KNOW I CANT TURN BACK IT ISNT TO SEE ELVES NOW NOR DRAGONS NOR MOUNTAINS THAT I WANT  I DONT RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT I WANT BUT I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO BEFORE THE END AND IT LIES AHEAD NOT IN THE SHIRE I MUST SEE IT THROUGH SIR IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME
I DONT ALTOGETHER BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT GANDALF CHOSE ME A GOOD COMPANION I AM CONTENT WE WILL GO TOGETHER
FRODO FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST IN SILENCE THEN STANDING UP HE LOOKED OVER THE LAND AHEAD AND CALLED TO PIPPIN
ALL READY TO START HE SAID AS PIPPIN RAN UP WE MUST BE GETTING OFF AT ONCE WE SLEPT LATE AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY MILES TO GO
YOU SLEPT LATE YOU MEAN SAID PIPPIN I WAS UP LONG BEFORE AND WE ARE ONLY WAITING FOR YOU TO FINISH EATING AND THINKING
I HAVE FINISHED BOTH NOW AND I AM GOING TO MAKE FOR BUCKLEBURY FERRY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I AM NOT GOING OUT OF THE WAY BACK TO THE ROAD WE LEFT LAST NIGHT I AM GOING TO CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS COUNTRY FROM HERE
THEN YOU ARE GOING TO FLY SAID PIPPIN YOU WONT CUT STRAIGHT ON FOOT ANYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY
WE CAN CUT STRAIGHTER THAN THE ROAD ANYWAY ANSWERED FRODO THE FERRY IS EAST FROM WOODHALL BUT THE HARD ROAD CURVES AWAY TO THE LEFT  YOU CAN SEE A BEND OF IT AWAY NORTH OVER THERE IT GOES ROUND THE NORTH END OF THE MARISH SO AS TO STRIKE THE CAUSEWAY FROM THE BRIDGE ABOVE STOCK BUT THAT IS MILES OUT OF THE WAY WE COULD SAVE A QUARTER OF THE DISTANCE IF WE MADE A LINE FOR THE FERRY FROM WHERE WE STAND
SHORT CUTS MAKE LONG DELAYS ARGUED PIPPIN THE COUNTRY IS ROUGH ROUND HERE AND THERE ARE BOGS AND ALL KINDS OF DIFFICULTIES DOWN IN THE MARISH  I KNOW THE LAND IN THESE PARTS AND IF YOU ARE WORRYING ABOUT BLACK RIDERS I CANT SEE THAT IT IS ANY WORSE MEETING THEM ON A ROAD THAN IN A WOOD OR A FIELD
IT IS LESS EASY TO FIND PEOPLE IN THE WOODS AND FIELDS ANSWERED FRODO AND IF YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE ROAD THERE IS SOME CHANCE THAT YOU WILL BE LOOKED FOR ON THE ROAD AND NOT OFF IT
ALL RIGHT SAID PIPPIN I WILL FOLLOW YOU INTO EVERY BOG AND DITCH BUT IT IS HARD I HAD COUNTED ON PASSING THE GOLDEN PERCH AT STOCK BEFORE SUNDOWN THE BEST BEER IN THE EASTFARTHING OR USED TO BE IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I TASTED IT
THAT SETTLES IT SAID FRODO SHORT CUTS MAKE DELAYS BUT INNS MAKE LONGER ONES AT ALL COSTS WE MUST KEEP YOU AWAY FROM THE GOLDEN PERCH WE WANT TO GET TO BUCKLEBURY BEFORE DARK WHAT DO YOU SAY SAM
I WILL GO ALONG WITH YOU MR FRODO SAID SAM IN SPITE OF PRIVATE MISGIVING AND A DEEP REGRET FOR THE BEST BEER IN THE EASTFARTHING
THEN IF WE ARE GOING TO TOIL THROUGH BOG AND BRIAR LETS GO NOW SAID PIPPIN
IT WAS ALREADY NEARLY AS HOT AS IT HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE BUT CLOUDS WERE BEGINNING TO COME UP FROM THE WEST IT LOOKED LIKELY TO TURN TO RAIN THE HOBBITS SCRAMBLED DOWN A STEEP GREEN BANK AND PLUNGED INTO THE THICK TREES BELOW THEIR COURSE HAD BEEN CHOSEN TO LEAVE WOODHALL TO THEIR LEFT AND TO CUT SLANTING THROUGH THE WOODS THAT CLUSTERED ALONG THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE HILLS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE FLATS BEYOND THEN THEY COULD MAKE STRAIGHT FOR THE FERRY OVER COUNTRY THAT WAS OPEN EXCEPT FOR A FEW DITCHES AND FENCES FRODO RECKONED THEY HAD EIGHTEEN MILES TO GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE
HE SOON FOUND THAT THE THICKET WAS CLOSER AND MORE TANGLED THAN IT HAD APPEARED THERE WERE NO PATHS IN THE UNDERGROWTH AND THEY DID NOT GET ON VERY FAST WHEN THEY HAD STRUGGLED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BANK THEY FOUND A STREAM RUNNING DOWN FROM THE HILLS BEHIND IN A DEEPLY DUG BED WITH STEEP SLIPPERY SIDES OVERHUNG WITH BRAMBLES MOST INCONVENIENTLY IT CUT ACROSS THE LINE THEY HAD CHOSEN THEY COULD NOT JUMP OVER IT NOR INDEED GET ACROSS IT AT ALL WITHOUT GETTING WET SCRATCHED AND MUDDY THEY HALTED WONDERING WHAT TO DO FIRST CHECK SAID PIPPIN SMILING GRIMLY
SAM GAMGEE LOOKED BACK THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE TREES HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TOP OF THE GREEN BANK FROM WHICH THEY HAD CLIMBED DOWN
LOOK HE SAID CLUTCHING FRODO BY THE ARM THEY ALL LOOKED AND ON THE EDGE HIGH ABOVE THEM THEY SAW AGAINST THE SKY A HORSE STANDING BESIDE IT STOOPED A BLACK FIGURE
THEY AT ONCE GAVE UP ANY IDEA OF GOING BACK FRODO LED THE WAY AND PLUNGED QUICKLY INTO THE THICK BUSHES BESIDE THE STREAM WHEW HE SAID TO PIPPIN WE WERE BOTH RIGHT THE SHORT CUT HAS GONE CROOKED ALREADY BUT WE GOT UNDER COVER ONLY JUST IN TIME YOUVE GOT SHARP EARS SAM CAN YOU HEAR ANYTHING COMING
THEY STOOD STILL ALMOST HOLDING THEIR BREATH AS THEY LISTENED BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF PURSUIT I DONT FANCY HE WOULD TRY BRINGING HIS HORSE DOWN THAT BANK SAID SAM BUT I GUESS HE KNOWS WE CAME DOWN IT WE HAD BETTER BE GOING ON
GOING ON WAS NOT ALTOGETHER EASY THEY HAD PACKS TO CARRY AND THE BUSHES AND BRAMBLES WERE RELUCTANT TO LET THEM THROUGH THEY WERE CUT OFF FROM THE WIND BY THE RIDGE BEHIND AND THE AIR WAS STILL AND STUFFY WHEN THEY FORCED THEIR WAY AT LAST INTO MORE OPEN GROUND THEY WERE HOT AND TIRED AND VERY SCRATCHED AND THEY WERE ALSO NO LONGER CERTAIN OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THEY WERE GOING THE BANKS OF THE STREAM SANK AS IT REACHED THE LEVELS AND BECAME BROADER AND SHALLOWER WANDERING OFF TOWARDS THE MARISH AND THE RIVER
WHY THIS IS THE STOCKBROOK SAID PIPPIN IF WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND GET BACK ON TO OUR COURSE WE MUST CROSS AT ONCE AND BEAR RIGHT
THEY WADED THE STREAM AND HURRIED OVER A WIDE OPEN SPACE RUSHGROWN AND TREELESS ON THE FURTHER SIDE BEYOND THAT THEY CAME AGAIN TO A BELT OF TREES TALL OAKS FOR THE MOST PART WITH HERE AND THERE AN ELM TREE OR AN ASH THE GROUND WAS FAIRLY LEVEL AND THERE WAS LITTLE UNDERGROWTH BUT THE TREES WERE LOO CLOSE FOR THEM TO SEE FAR AHEAD THE LEAVES BLEW UPWARDS IN SUDDEN GUSTS OF WIND AND SPOTS OF RAIN BEGAN TO FALL FROM THE OVERCAST SKY THEN THE WIND DIED AWAY AND THE RAIN CAME STREAMING DOWN THEY TRUDGED ALONG AS FAST AS THEY COULD OVER PATCHES OF GRASS AND THROUGH THICK DRIFTS OF OLD LEAVES AND ALL ABOUT THEM THE RAIN PATTERED AND TRICKLED THEY DID NOT TALK BUT KEPT GLANCING BACK AND FROM SIDE TO SIDE
AFTER HALF AN HOUR PIPPIN SAID I HOPE WE HAVE NOT TURNED TOO MUCH TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND ARE NOT WALKING LONGWISE THROUGH THIS WOOD IT IS NOT A VERY BROAD BELT I SHOULD HAVE SAID NO MORE THAN A MILE AT THE WIDEST  AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT BY NOW
IT IS NO GOOD OUR STARTING TO GO IN ZIGZAGS SAID FRODO THAT WONT MEND MATTERS LET US KEEP ON AS WE ARE GOING I AM NOT SURE THAT I WANT TO COME OUT INTO THE OPEN YET
THEY WENT ON FOR PERHAPS ANOTHER COUPLE OF MILES THEN THE SUN GLEAMED OUT OF RAGGED CLOUDS AGAIN AND THE RAIN LESSENED IT WAS NOW PAST MIDDAY AND THEY FELT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR LUNCH THEY HALTED UNDER AN ELM TREE ITS LEAVES THOUGH FAST TURNING YELLOW WERE STILL THICK AND THE GROUND AT ITS FEEL WAS FAIRLY DRY AND SHELTERED WHEN THEY CAME TO MAKE THEIR MEAL THEY FOUND THAT THE ELVES HAD FILLED THEIR BOTTLES WITH A CLEAR DRINK PALE GOLDEN IN COLOUR IT HAD THE SCENT OF A HONEY MADE OF MANY FLOWERS AND WAS WONDERFULLY REFRESHING VERY SOON THEY WERE LAUGHING AND SNAPPING THEIR FINGERS AT RAIN AND AT BLACK RIDERS THE LAST FEW MILES THEY FELT WOULD SOON BE BEHIND THEM
FRODO PROPPED HIS BACK AGAINST THE TREETRUNK AND CLOSED HIS EYES SAM AND PIPPIN SAT NEAR AND THEY BEGAN TO HUM AND THEN TO SING SOFTLY
HO HO HO TO THE BOTTLE I GO
TO HEAL MY HEART AND DROWN MY WOE
RAIN MAY FALL AND WIND MAY BLOW
AND MANY MILES BE STILL TO GO
BUT UNDER A TALL TREE I WILL LIE
AND LET THE CLOUDS GO SAILING BY

HO HO HO THEY BEGAN AGAIN LOUDER THEY STOPPED SHORT SUDDENLY FRODO SPRANG TO HIS FEET A LONGDRAWN WAIL CAME DOWN THE WIND LIKE THE CRY OF SOME EVIL AND LONELY CREATURE IT ROSE AND FELL AND ENDED ON A HIGH PIERCING NOTE EVEN AS THEY SAT AND STOOD AS IF SUDDENLY FROZEN IT WAS ANSWERED BY ANOTHER CRY FAINTER AND FURTHER OFF BUT NO LESS CHILLING TO THE BLOOD THERE WAS THEN A SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE SOUND OF THE WIND IN THE LEAVES
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WAS PIPPIN ASKED AT LAST TRYING TO SPEAK LIGHTLY BUT QUAVERING A LITTLE IF IT WAS A BIRD IT WAS ONE THAT I NEVER HEARD IN THE SHIRE BEFORE
IT WAS NOT BIRD OR BEAST SAID FRODO IT WAS A CALL OR A SIGNAL  THERE WERE WORDS IN THAT CRY THOUGH I COULD NOT CATCH THEM BUT NO HOBBIT HAS SUCH A VOICE
NO MORE WAS SAID ABOUT IT THEY WERE ALL THINKING OF THE RIDERS BUT NO ONE SPOKE OF THEM THEY WERE NOW RELUCTANT EITHER TO STAY OR GO ON BUT SOONER OR LATER THEY HAD GOT TO GET ACROSS THE OPEN COUNTRY TO THE FERRY AND IT WAS BEST TO GO SOONER AND IN DAYLIGHT IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY HAD SHOULDERED THEIR PACKS AGAIN AND WERE OFF
BEFORE LONG THE WOOD CAME TO A SUDDEN END WIDE GRASSLANDS STRETCHED BEFORE THEM THEY NOW SAW THAT THEY HAD IN FACT TURNED TOO MUCH TO THE SOUTH AWAY OVER THE FLATS THEY COULD GLIMPSE THE LOW HILL OF BUCKLEBURY ACROSS THE RIVER BUT IT WAS NOW TO THEIR LEFT CREEPING CAUTIOUSLY OUT FROM THE EDGE OF THE TREES THEY SET OFF ACROSS THE OPEN AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD
AT FIRST THEY FELT AFRAID AWAY FROM THE SHELTER OF THE WOOD FAR BACK BEHIND THEM STOOD THE HIGH PLACE WHERE THEY HAD BREAKFASTED FRODO HALF EXPECTED TO SEE THE SMALL DISTANT FIGURE OF A HORSEMAN ON THE RIDGE DARK AGAINST THE SKY BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ONE THE SUN ESCAPING FROM THE BREAKING CLOUDS AS IT SANK TOWARDS THE HILLS THEY HAD LEFT WAS NOW SHINING BRIGHTLY AGAIN THEIR FEAR LEFT THEM THOUGH THEY STILL FELT UNEASY BUT THE LAND BECAME STEADILY MORE TAME AND WELLORDERED SOON THEY CAME INTO WELLTENDED FIELDS AND MEADOWS THERE WERE HEDGES AND GATES AND DIKES FOR DRAINAGE EVERYTHING SEEMED QUIET AND PEACEFUL JUST AN ORDINARY CORNER OF THE SHIRE THEIR SPIRITS ROSE WITH EVERY STEP THE LINE OF THE RIVER GREW NEARER AND THE BLACK RIDERS BEGAN TO SEEM LIKE PHANTOMS OF THE WOODS NOW LEFT FAR BEHIND
THEY PASSED ALONG THE EDGE OF A HUGE TURNIPFIELD AND CAME TO A STOUT GATE BEYOND IT A RUTTED LANE RAN BETWEEN LOW WELLLAID HEDGES TOWARDS A DISTANT CLUMP OF TREES PIPPIN STOPPED
I KNOW THESE FIELDS AND THIS GATE HE SAID THIS IS BAMFURLONG OLD FARMER MAGGOTS LAND THATS HIS FARM AWAY THERE IN THE TREES
ONE TROUBLE AFTER ANOTHER SAID FRODO LOOKING NEARLY AS MUCH ALARMED AS IF PIPPIN HAD DECLARED THE LANE WAS THE SLOT LEADING TO A DRAGONS DEN THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
WHATS WRONG WITH OLD MAGGOT ASKED PIPPIN HES A GOOD FRIEND TO ALL THE BRANDYBUCKS OF COURSE HES A TERROR TO TRESPASSERS AND KEEPS FEROCIOUS DOGS  BUT AFTER ALL FOLK DOWN HERE ARE NEAR THE BORDER AND HAVE TO BE MORE ON THEIR GUARD
I KNOW SAID FRODO BUT ALL THE SAME HE ADDED WITH A SHAMEFACED LAUGH I AM TERRIFIED OF HIM AND HIS DOGS I HAVE AVOIDED HIS FARM FOR YEARS AND YEARS HE CAUGHT ME SEVERAL TIMES TRESPASSING AFTER MUSHROOMS WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER AT BRANDY HALL ON THE LAST OCCASION HE BEAT ME AND THEN TOOK ME AND SHOWED ME TO HIS DOGS SEE LADS HE SAID NEXT TIME THIS YOUNG VARMINT SETS FOOT ON MY LAND YOU CAN EAT HIM NOW SEE HIM OFF THEY CHASED ME ALL THE WAY TO THE FERRY I HAVE NEVER GOT OVER THE FRIGHT  THOUGH I DARESAY THE BEASTS KNEW THEIR BUSINESS AND WOULD NOT REALLY HAVE TOUCHED ME
PIPPIN LAUGHED WELL ITS TIME YOU MADE IT UP ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE COMING BACK TO LIVE IN BUCKLAND OLD MAGGOT IS REALLY A STOUT FELLOW  IF YOU LEAVE HIS MUSHROOMS ALONE LETS GET INTO THE LANE AND THEN WE SHANT BE TRESPASSING IF WE MEET HIM ILL DO THE TALKING HE IS A FRIEND OF MERRYS AND I USED TO COME HERE WITH HIM A GOOD DEAL AT ONE TIME
THEY WENT ALONG THE LANE UNTIL THEY SAW THE THATCHED ROOFS OF A LARGE HOUSE AND FARMBUILDINGS PEEPING OUT AMONG THE TREES AHEAD THE MAGGOTS AND THE PUDDIFOOTS OF STOCK AND MOST OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE MARISH WERE HOUSEDWELLERS AND THIS FARM WAS STOUTLY BUILT OF BRICK AND HAD A HIGH WALL ALL ROUND IT THERE WAS A WIDE WOODEN GATE OPENING OUT OF THE WALL INTO THE LANE
SUDDENLY AS THEY DREW NEARER A TERRIFIC BAYING AND BARKING BROKE OUT AND A LOUD VOICE WAS HEARD SHOUTING GRIP FANG WOLF COME ON LADS
FRODO AND SAM STOPPED DEAD BUT PIPPIN WALKED ON A FEW PACES THE GATE OPENED AND THREE HUGE DOGS CAME PELTING OUT INTO THE LANE AND DASHED TOWARDS THE TRAVELLERS BARKING FIERCELY THEY TOOK NO NOTICE OF PIPPIN BUT SAM SHRANK AGAINST THE WALL WHILE TWO WOLVISHLOOKING DOGS SNIFFED AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY AND SNARLED IF HE MOVED THE LARGEST AND MOST FEROCIOUS OF THE THREE HALTED IN FRONT OF FRODO BRISTLING AND GROWLING
THROUGH THE GATE THERE NOW APPEARED A BROAD THICKSET HOBBIT WITH A ROUND RED FACE HALLO HALLO AND WHO MAY YOU BE AND WHAT MAY YOU BE WANTING HE ASKED
GOOD AFTERNOON MR MAGGOT SAID PIPPIN
THE FARMER LOOKED AT HIM CLOSELY WELL IF IT ISNT MASTER PIPPIN  MR PEREGRIN TOOK I SHOULD SAY HE CRIED CHANGING FROM A SCOWL TO A GRIN ITS A LONG TIME SINCE I SAW YOU ROUND HERE ITS LUCKY FOR YOU THAT I KNOW YOU I WAS JUST GOING OUT TO SET MY DOGS ON ANY STRANGERS THERE ARE SOME FUNNY THINGS GOING ON TODAY OF COURSE WE DO GET QUEER FOLK WANDERING IN THESE PARTS AT TIMES TOO NEAR THE RIVER HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD BUT THIS FELLOW WAS THE MOST OUTLANDISH I HAVE EVER SET EYES ON HE WONT CROSS MY LAND WITHOUT LEAVE A SECOND TIME NOT IF I CAN STOP IT
WHAT FELLOW DO YOU MEAN ASKED PIPPIN
THEN YOU HAVENT SEEN HIM SAID THE FARMER HE WENT UP THE LANE TOWARDS THE CAUSEWAY NOT A LONG WHILE BACK HE WAS A FUNNY CUSTOMER AND ASKING FUNNY QUESTIONS BUT PERHAPS YOULL COME ALONG INSIDE AND WELL PASS THE NEWS MORE COMFORTABLE IVE A DROP OF GOOD ALE ON TAP IF YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE WILLING MR TOOK
IT SEEMED PLAIN THAT THE FARMER WOULD TELL THEM MORE IF ALLOWED TO DO IT IN HIS OWN TIME AND FASHION SO THEY ALL ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WHAT ABOUT THE DOGS ASKED FRODO ANXIOUSLY
THE FARMER LAUGHED THEY WONT HARM YOU  NOT UNLESS I TELL EM TO HERE GRIP FANG HEEL HE CRIED HEEL WOLF TO THE RELIEF OF FRODO AND SAM THE DOGS WALKED AWAY AND LET THEM GO FREE
PIPPIN INTRODUCED THE OTHER TWO TO THE FARMER MR FRODO BAGGINS HE SAID YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER HIM BUT HE USED TO LIVE AT BRANDY HALL AT THE NAME BAGGINS THE FARMER STARTED AND GAVE FRODO A SHARP GLANCE FOR A MOMENT FRODO THOUGHT THAT THE MEMORY OF STOLEN MUSHROOMS HAD BEEN AROUSED AND THAT THE DOGS WOULD BE TOLD TO SEE HIM OFF BUT FARMER MAGGOT TOOK HIM BY THE ARM
WELL IF THAT ISNT QUEERER THAN EVER HE EXCLAIMED MR BAGGINS IS IT COME INSIDE WE MUST HAVE A TALK
THEY WENT INTO THE FARMERS KITCHEN AND SAT BY THE WIDE FIREPLACE MRS MAGGOT BROUGHT OUT BEER IN A HUGE JUG AND FILLED FOUR LARGE MUGS IT WAS A GOOD BREW AND PIPPIN FOUND HIMSELF MORE THAN COMPENSATED FOR MISSING THE GOLDEN PERCH SAM SIPPED HIS BEER SUSPICIOUSLY HE HAD A NATURAL MISTRUST OF THE INHABITANTS OF OTHER PARTS OF THE SHIRE AND ALSO HE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BE QUICK FRIENDS WITH ANYONE WHO HAD BEATEN HIS MASTER HOWEVER LONG AGO
AFTER A FEW REMARKS ABOUT THE WEATHER AND THE AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS WHICH WERE NO WORSE THAN USUAL FARMER MAGGOT PUT DOWN HIS MUG AND LOOKED AT THEM ALL IN TURN
NOW MR PEREGRIN HE SAID WHERE MIGHT YOU BE COMING FROM AND WHERE MIGHT YOU BE GOING TO WERE YOU COMING TO VISIT ME FOR IF SO YOU HAD GONE PAST MY GATE WITHOUT MY SEEING YOU
WELL NO ANSWERED PIPPIN TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH SINCE YOU HAVE GUESSED IT WE GOT INTO THE LANE FROM THE OTHER END WE HAD COME OVER YOUR FIELDS BUT THAT WAS QUITE BY ACCIDENT WE LOST OUR WAY IN THE WOODS BACK NEAR WOODHALL TRYING TO TAKE A SHORT CUT TO THE FERRY
IF YOU WERE IN A HURRY THE ROAD WOULD HAVE SERVED YOU BETTER SAID THE FARMER BUT I WASNT WORRYING ABOUT THAT YOU HAVE LEAVE TO WALK OVER MY LAND IF YOU HAVE A MIND MR PEREGRIN AND YOU MR BAGGINS  THOUGH I DARESAY YOU STILL LIKE MUSHROOMS HE LAUGHED AH YES I RECOGNIZED THE NAME I RECOLLECT THE TIME WHEN YOUNG FRODO BAGGINS WAS ONE OF THE WORST YOUNG RASCALS OF BUCKLAND BUT IT WASNT MUSHROOMS I WAS THINKING OF I HAD JUST HEARD THE NAME BAGGINS BEFORE YOU TURNED UP WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT FUNNY CUSTOMER ASKED ME
THEY WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR HIM TO GO ON WELL THE FARMER CONTINUED APPROACHING HIS POINT WITH SLOW RELISH HE CAME RIDING ON A BIG BLACK HORSE IN AT THE GATE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE OPEN AND RIGHT UP TO MY DOOR ALL BLACK HE WAS HIMSELF TOO AND CLOAKED AND HOODED UP AS IF HE DID NOT WANT TO BE KNOWN NOW WHAT IN THE SHIRE CAN HE WANT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WE DONT SEE MANY OF THE BIG FOLK OVER THE BORDER AND ANYWAY I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY LIKE THIS BLACK FELLOW
 GOODDAY TO YOU I SAYS GOING OUT TO HIM THIS LANE DONT LEAD ANYWHERE AND WHEREVER YOU MAY BE GOING YOUR QUICKEST WAY WILL BE BACK TO THE ROAD I DIDNT LIKE THE LOOKS OF HIM AND WHEN GRIP CAME OUT HE TOOK ONE SNIFF AND LET OUT A YELP AS IF HE HAD BEEN SLUNG HE PUT DOWN HIS TAIL AND BOLTED OFF HOWLING THE BLACK FELLOW SAT QUITE STILL
 I COME FROM YONDER HE SAID SLOW AND STIFFLIKE POINTING BACK WEST OVER MY FIELDS IF YOU PLEASE HAVE YOU SEEN BAGGINS HE ASKED IN A QUEER VOICE AND BENT DOWN TOWARDS ME I COULD NOT SEE ANY FACE FOR HIS HOOD FELL DOWN SO LOW AND I FELT A SORT OF SHIVER DOWN MY BACK BUT I DID NOT SEE WHY HE SHOULD COME RIDING OVER MY LAND SO BOLD
 BE OFF I SAID THERE ARE NO BAGGINSES HERE YOURE IN THE WRONG PART OF THE SHIRE YOU HAD BETTER GO BACK WEST TO HOBBITON  BUT YOU CAN GO BY ROAD THIS TIME
 BAGGINS HAS LEFT HE ANSWERED IN A WHISPER HE IS COMING HE IS NOT FAR AWAY I WISH TO FIND HIM IF HE PASSES WILL YOU TELL ME I WILL COME BACK WITH GOLD
 NO YOU WONT I SAID YOULL GO BACK WHERE YOU BELONG DOUBLE QUICK I GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE BEFORE I CALL ALL MY DOGS
HE GAVE A SORT OF HISS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AND IT MIGHT NOT THEN HE SPURRED HIS GREAT HORSE RIGHT AT ME AND I JUMPED OUT OF THE WAY ONLY JUST IN TIME I CALLED THE DOGS BUT HE SWUNG OFF AND RODE THROUGH THE GATE AND UP THE LANE TOWARDS THE CAUSEWAY LIKE A BOLT OF THUNDER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
FRODO SAT FOR A MOMENT LOOKING AT THE FIRE BUT HIS ONLY THOUGHT WAS HOW ON EARTH WOULD THEY REACH THE FERRY I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK HE SAID AT LAST
THEN ILL TELL YOU WHAT TO THINK SAID MAGGOT YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE MIXING YOURSELF UP WITH HOBBITON FOLK MR FRODO FOLK ARE QUEER UP THERE SAM STIRRED IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED AT THE FARMER WITH AN UNFRIENDLY EYE BUT YOU WERE ALWAYS A RECKLESS LAD WHEN I HEARD YOU HAD LEFT THE BRANDYBUCKS AND GONE OFF TO THAT OLD MR BILBO I SAID THAT YOU WERE GOING TO FIND TROUBLE MARK MY WORDS THIS ALL COMES OF THOSE STRANGE DOINGS OF MR BILBOS HIS MONEY WAS GOT IN SOME STRANGE FASHION IN FOREIGN PARTS THEY SAY MAYBE THERE IS SOME THAT WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE GOLD AND JEWELS THAT HE BURIED IN THE HILL OF HOBBITON AS I HEAR

AH BUT WAIT A MINUTE I WAS GOING TO SAY AFTER A BIT OF SUPPER ILL GET OUT A SMALL WAGGON AND ILL DRIVE YOU ALL TO THE FERRY THAT WILL SAVE YOU A GOOD STEP AND IT MIGHT ALSO SAVE YOU TROUBLE OF ANOTHER SORT
FRODO NOW ACCEPTED THE INVITATION GRATEFULLY TO THE RELIEF OF PIPPIN AND SAM THE SUN WAS ALREADY BEHIND THE WESTERN HILLS AND THE LIGHT WAS FAILING TWO OF MAGGOTS SONS AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS CAME IN AND A GENEROUS SUPPER WAS LAID ON THE LARGE TABLE THE KITCHEN WAS LIT WITH CANDLES AND THE FIRE WAS MENDED MRS MAGGOT HUSTLED IN AND OUT ONE OR TWO OTHER HOBBITS BELONGING TO THE FARMHOUSEHOLD CAME IN IN A SHORT WHILE FOURTEEN SAT DOWN TO EAT THERE WAS BEER IN PLENTY AND A MIGHTY DISH OF MUSHROOMS AND BACON BESIDES MUCH OTHER SOLID FARMHOUSE FARE THE DOGS LAY BY THE FIRE AND GNAWED RINDS AND CRACKED BONES
WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THE FARMER AND HIS SONS WENT OUT WITH A LANTERN AND GOT THE WAGGON READY IT WAS DARK IN THE YARD WHEN THE GUESTS CAME OUT THEY THREW THEIR PACKS ON BOARD AND CLIMBED IN THE FARMER SAT IN THE DRIVINGSEAT AND WHIPPED UP HIS TWO STOUT PONIES HIS WIFE STOOD IN THE LIGHT OF THE OPEN DOOR
YOU BE CAREFUL OF YOURSELF MAGGOT SHE CALLED DONT GO ARGUING WITH ANY FOREIGNERS AND COME STRAIGHT BACK
I WILL SAID HE AND DROVE OUT OF THE GATE THERE WAS NOW NO BREATH OF WIND STIRRING THE NIGHT WAS STILL AND QUIET AND A CHILL WAS IN THE AIR THEY WENT WITHOUT LIGHTS AND TOOK IT SLOWLY AFTER A MILE OR TWO THE LANE CAME TO AN END CROSSING A DEEP DIKE AND CLIMBING A SHORT SLOPE UP ON TO THE HIGHBANKED CAUSEWAY
MAGGOT GOT DOWN AND TOOK A GOOD LOOK EITHER WAY NORTH AND SOUTH BUT NOTHING COULD BE SEEN IN THE DARKNESS AND THERE WAS NOT A SOUND IN THE STILL AIR THIN STRANDS OF RIVERMIST WERE HANGING ABOVE THE DIKES AND CRAWLING OVER THE FIELDS
ITS GOING TO BE THICK SAID MAGGOT BUT ILL NOT LIGHT MY LANTERN TILL I TURN FOR HOME WELL HEAR ANYTHING ON THE ROAD LONG BEFORE WE MEET IT TONIGHT
IT WAS FIVE MILES OR MORE FROM MAGGOTS LANE TO THE FERRY THE HOBBITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES UP BUT THEIR EARS WERE STRAINED FOR ANY SOUND ABOVE THE CREAK OF THE WHEELS AND THE SLOW CLOP OF THE PONIES HOOFS THE WAGGON SEEMED SLOWER THAN A SNAIL TO FRODO BESIDE HIM PIPPIN WAS NODDING TOWARDS SLEEP BUT SAM WAS STARING FORWARDS INTO THE RISING FOG
THEY REACHED THE ENTRANCE TO THE FERRY LANE AT LAST IT WAS MARKED BY TWO TALL WHITE POSTS THAT SUDDENLY LOOMED UP ON THEIR RIGHT FARMER MAGGOT DREW IN HIS PONIES AND THE WAGGON CREAKED TO A HALT THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING LO SCRAMBLE OUT WHEN SUDDENLY THEY HEARD WHAT THEY HAD ALL BEEN DREADING HOOFS ON THE ROAD AHEAD THE SOUND WAS COMING TOWARDS THEM
MAGGOT JUMPED DOWN AND STOOD HOLDING THE PONIES HEADS AND PEERING FORWARD INTO THE GLOOM CLIPCLOP CLIPCLOP CAME THE APPROACHING RIDER THE FALL OF THE HOOFS SOUNDED LOUD IN THE STILL FOGGY AIR
YOUD BETTER BE HIDDEN MR FRODO SAID SAM ANXIOUSLY YOU GET DOWN IN THE WAGGON AND COVER UP WITH BLANKETS AND WELL SEND THIS RIDER TO THE RIGHTABOUTS HE CLIMBED OUT AND WENT TO THE FARMERS SIDE BLACK RIDERS WOULD HAVE TO RIDE OVER HIM TO GET NEAR THE WAGGON
CLOPCLOP CLOPCLOP THE RIDER WAS NEARLY ON THEM
HALLO THERE CALLED FARMER MAGGOT THE ADVANCING HOOFS STOPPED SHORT THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DIMLY GUESS A DARK CLOAKED SHAPE IN THE MIST A YARD OR TWO AHEAD NOW THEN SAID THE FARMER THROWING THE REINS TO SAM AND STRIDING FORWARD DONT YOU COME A STEP NEARER WHAT DO YOU WANT AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING
I WANT MR BAGGINS HAVE YOU SEEN HIM SAID A MUFFLED VOICE  BUT THE VOICE WAS THE VOICE OF MERRY BRANDYBUCK A DARK LANTERN WAS UNCOVERED AND ITS LIGHT FELL ON THE ASTONISHED FACE OF THE FARMER
MR MERRY HE CRIED
YES OF COURSE WHO DID YOU THINK IT WAS SAID MERRY COMING FORWARD AS HE CAME OUT OF THE MIST AND THEIR FEARS SUBSIDED HE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO DIMINISH TO ORDINARY HOBBITSIZE HE WAS RIDING A PONY AND A SCARF WAS SWATHED ROUND HIS NECK AND OVER HIS CHIN TO KEEP OUT THE FOG
FRODO SPRANG OUT OF THE WAGGON TO GREET HIM SO THERE YOU ARE AT LAST SAID MERRY I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER IF YOU WOULD TURN UP AT ALL TODAY AND I WAS JUST GOING BACK TO SUPPER WHEN IT GREW FOGGY I CAME ACROSS AND RODE UP TOWARDS STOCK TO SEE IF YOU HAD FALLEN IN ANY DITCHES BUT IM BLEST IF I KNOW WHICH WAY YOU HAVE COME WHERE DID YOU FIND THEM MR MAGGOT IN YOUR DUCKPOND

THEY WATCHED THE PALE RINGS OF LIGHT ROUND HIS LANTERNS AS THEY DWINDLED INTO THE FOGGY NIGHT SUDDENLY FRODO LAUGHED FROM THE COVERED BASKET HE HELD THE SCENT OF MUSHROOMS WAS RISING



CHAPTER 5
A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED

NOW WE HAD BETTER GET HOME OURSELVES SAID MERRY THERES SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT ALL THIS I SEE BUT IT MUST WAIT TILL WE GET IN
THEY TURNED DOWN THE FERRY LANE WHICH WAS STRAIGHT AND WELLKEPT AND EDGED WITH LARGE WHITEWASHED STONES IN A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO IT BROUGHT THEM TO THE RIVERBANK WHERE THERE WAS A BROAD WOODEN LANDINGSTAGE A LARGE FLAT FERRYBOAT WAS MOORED BESIDE IT THE WHITE BOLLARDS NEAR THE WATERS EDGE GLIMMERED IN THE LIGHT OF TWO LAMPS ON HIGH POSTS BEHIND THEM THE MISTS IN THE FLAT FIELDS WERE NOW ABOVE THE HEDGES BUT THE WATER BEFORE THEM WAS DARK WITH ONLY A FEW CURLING WISPS LIKE STEAM AMONG THE REEDS BY THE BANK THERE SEEMED TO BE LESS FOG ON THE FURTHER SIDE
MERRY LED THE PONY OVER A GANGWAY ON TO THE FERRY AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED MERRY THEN PUSHED SLOWLY OFF WITH A LONG POLE THE BRANDYWINE FLOWED SLOW AND BROAD BEFORE THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE THE BANK WAS STEEP AND UP IT A WINDING PATH CLIMBED FROM THE FURTHER LANDING LAMPS WERE TWINKLING THERE BEHIND LOOMED UP THE BUCK HILL AND OUT OF IT THROUGH STRAY SHROUDS OF MIST SHONE MANY ROUND WINDOWS YELLOW AND RED THEY WERE THE WINDOWS OF BRANDY HALL THE ANCIENT HOME OF THE BRANDYBUCKS
LONG AGO GORHENDAD OLDBUCK HEAD OF THE OLDBUCK FAMILY ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE MARISH OR INDEED IN THE SHIRE HAD CROSSED THE RIVER WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL BOUNDARY OF THE LAND EASTWARDS HE BUILT AND EXCAVATED BRANDY HALL CHANGED HIS NAME TO BRANDYBUCK AND SETTLED DOWN TO BECOME MASTER OF WHAT WAS VIRTUALLY A SMALL INDEPENDENT COUNTRY HIS FAMILY GREW AND GREW AND AFTER HIS DAYS CONTINUED TO GROW UNTIL BRANDY HALL OCCUPIED THE WHOLE OF THE LOW HILL AND HAD THREE LARGE FRONTDOORS MANY SIDEDOORS AND ABOUT A HUNDRED WINDOWS THE BRANDYBUCKS AND THEIR NUMEROUS DEPENDANTS THEN BEGAN TO BURROW AND LATER TO BUILD ALL ROUND ABOUT THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF BUCKLAND A THICKLY INHABITED STRIP BETWEEN THE RIVER AND THE OLD FOREST A SORT OF COLONY FROM THE SHIRE ITS CHIEF VILLAGE WAS BUCKLEBURY CLUSTERING IN THE BANKS AND SLOPES BEHIND BRANDY HALL
THE PEOPLE IN THE MARISH WERE FRIENDLY WITH THE BUCKLANDERS AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE MASTER OF THE HALL AS THE HEAD OF THE BRANDYBUCK FAMILY WAS CALLED WAS STILL ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE FARMERS BETWEEN STOCK AND RUSHEY BUT MOST OF THE FOLK OF THE OLD SHIRE REGARDED THE BUCKLANDERS AS PECULIAR HALF FOREIGNERS AS IT WERE THOUGH AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER HOBBITS OF THE FOUR FARTHINGS EXCEPT IN ONE POINT THEY WERE FOND OF BOATS AND SOME OF THEM COULD SWIM
THEIR LAND WAS ORIGINALLY UNPROTECTED FROM THE EAST BUT ON THAT SIDE THEY HAD BUILT A HEDGE THE HIGH HAY IT HAD BEEN PLANTED MANY GENERATIONS AGO AND WAS NOW THICK AND TALL FOR IT WAS CONSTANTLY TENDED IT RAN ALL THE WAY FROM BRANDYWINE BRIDGE IN A BIG LOOP CURVING AWAY FROM THE RIVER TO HAYSEND WHERE THE WITHYWINDLE FLOWED OUT OF THE FOREST INTO THE BRANDYWINE WELL OVER TWENTY MILES FROM END TO END BUT OF COURSE IT WAS NOT A COMPLETE PROTECTION THE FOREST DREW CLOSE TO THE HEDGE IN MANY PLACES THE BUCKLANDERS KEPT THEIR DOORS LOCKED AFTER DARK AND THAT ALSO WAS NOT USUAL IN THE SHIRE
THE FERRYBOAT MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE WATER THE BUCKLAND SHORE DREW NEARER SAM WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE PARTY WHO HAD NOT BEEN OVER THE RIVER BEFORE HE HAD A STRANGE FEELING AS THE SLOW GURGLING STREAM SLIPPED BY HIS OLD LIFE LAY BEHIND IN THE MISTS DARK ADVENTURE LAY IN FRONT HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND FOR A MOMENT HAD A PASSING WISH THAT MR FRODO COULD HAVE GONE ON LIVING QUIETLY AT BAG END
THE FOUR HOBBITS STEPPED OFF THE FERRY MERRY WAS TYING IT UP AND PIPPIN WAS ALREADY LEADING THE PONY UP THE PATH WHEN SAM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING BACK AS IF TO TAKE FAREWELL OF THE SHIRE SAID IN A HOARSE WHISPER
LOOK BACK MR FRODO DO YOU SEE ANYTHING
ON THE FAR STAGE UNDER THE DISTANT LAMPS THEY COULD JUST MAKE OUT A FIGURE IT LOOKED LIKE A DARK BLACK BUNDLE LEFT BEHIND BUT AS THEY LOOKED IT SEEMED TO MOVE AND SWAY THIS WAY AND THAT AS IF SEARCHING THE GROUND IT THEN CRAWLED OR WENT CROUCHING BACK INTO THE GLOOM BEYOND THE LAMPS
WHAT IN THE SHIRE IS THAT EXCLAIMED MERRY
SOMETHING THAT IS FOLLOWING US SAID FRODO BUT DONT ASK ANY MORE NOW LETS GET AWAY AT ONCE THEY HURRIED UP THE PATH TO THE TOP OF THE BANK BUT WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK THE FAR SHORE WAS SHROUDED IN MIST AND NOTHING COULD BE SEEN
THANK GOODNESS YOU DONT KEEP ANY BOATS ON THE WESTBANK SAID FRODO CAN HORSES CROSS THE RIVER
THEY CAN GO TWENTY MILES NORTH TO BRANDYWINE BRIDGE  OR THEY MIGHT SWIM ANSWERED MERRY THOUGH I NEVER HEARD OF ANY HORSE SWIMMING THE BRANDYWINE BUT WHAT HAVE HORSES TO DO WITH IT ILL TELL YOU LATER LETS GET INDOORS AND THEN WE CAN TALK
ALL RIGHT YOU AND PIPPIN KNOW YOUR WAY SO ILL JUST RIDE ON AND TELL FATTY BOLGER THAT YOU ARE COMING WELL SEE ABOUT SUPPER AND THINGS
WE HAD OUR SUPPER EARLY WITH FARMER MAGGOT SAID FRODO BUT WE COULD DO WITH ANOTHER
YOU SHALL HAVE IT GIVE ME THAT BASKET SAID MERRY AND RODE AHEAD INTO THE DARKNESS
IT WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE BRANDYWINE TO FRODOS NEW HOUSE AT CRICKHOLLOW THEY PASSED BUCK HILL AND BRANDY HALL ON THEIR LEFT AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BUCKLEBURY STRUCK THE MAIN ROAD OF BUCKLAND THAT RAN SOUTH FROM THE BRIDGE HALF A MILE NORTHWARD ALONG THIS THEY CAME TO A LANE OPENING ON THEIR RIGHT THIS THEY FOLLOWED FOR A COUPLE OF MILES AS IT CLIMBED UP AND DOWN INTO THE COUNTRY
AT LAST THEY CAME TO A NARROW GATE IN A THICK HEDGE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN OF THE HOUSE IN THE DARK IT STOOD BACK FROM THE LANE IN THE MIDDLE OF A WIDE CIRCLE OF LAWN SURROUNDED BY A BELT OF LOW TREES INSIDE THE OUTER HEDGE FRODO HAD CHOSEN IT BECAUSE IT STOOD IN AN OUTOFTHEWAY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY AND THERE WERE NO OTHER DWELLINGS CLOSE BY YOU COULD GET IN AND OUT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IT HAD BEEN BUILT A LONG WHILE BEFORE BY THE BRANDYBUCKS FOR THE USE OF GUESTS OR MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THAT WISHED TO ESCAPE FROM THE CROWDED LIFE OF BRANDY HALL FOR A TIME IT WAS AN OLDFASHIONED COUNTRIFIED HOUSE AS MUCH LIKE A HOBBITHOLE AS POSSIBLE IT WAS LONG AND LOW WITH NO UPPER STOREY AND IT HAD A ROOF OF TURF ROUND WINDOWS AND A LARGE ROUND DOOR
AS THEY WALKED UP THE GREEN PATH FROM THE GATE NO LIGHT WAS VISIBLE THE WINDOWS WERE DARK AND SHUTTERED FRODO KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND FATTY BOLGER OPENED IT A FRIENDLY LIGHT STREAMED OUT THEY SLIPPED IN QUICKLY AND SHUT THEMSELVES AND THE LIGHT INSIDE THEY WERE IN A WIDE HALL WITH DOORS ON EITHER SIDE IN FRONT OF THEM A PASSAGE RAN BACK DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ASKED MERRY COMING UP THE PASSAGE WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST IN A SHORT TIME TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HOME AFTER ALL FATTY AND I ONLY GOT HERE WITH THE LAST CARTLOAD YESTERDAY
FRODO LOOKED ROUND IT DID LOOK LIKE HOME MANY OF HIS OWN FAVOURITE THINGS  OR BILBOS THINGS THEY REMINDED HIM SHARPLY OF HIM IN THEIR NEW SELLING  WERE ARRANGED AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE AS THEY HAD BEEN AT BAG END IT WAS A PLEASANT COMFORTABLE WELCOMING PLACE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF WISHING THAT HE WAS REALLY COMING HERE TO SETTLE DOWN IN QUIET RETIREMENT IT SEEMED UNFAIR TO HAVE PUT HIS FRIENDS TO ALL THIS TROUBLE AND HE WONDERED AGAIN HOW HE WAS GOING TO BREAK THE NEWS TO THEM THAT HE MUST LEAVE THEM SO SOON INDEED AT ONCE YET THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE THAT VERY NIGHT BEFORE THEY ALL WENT TO BED
ITS DELIGHTFUL HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT I HARDLY FEEL THAT I HAVE MOVED AT ALL
THE TRAVELLERS HUNG UP THEIR CLOAKS AND PILED THEIR PACKS ON THE FLOOR MERRY LED THEM DOWN THE PASSAGE AND THREW OPEN A DOOR AT THE FAR END FIRELIGHT CAME OUT AND A PUFF OF STEAM
A BATH CRIED PIPPIN O BLESSED MERIADOC
WHICH ORDER SHALL WE GO IN SAID FRODO ELDEST FIRST OR QUICKEST FIRST YOULL BE LAST EITHER WAY MASTER PEREGRIN
TRUST ME TO ARRANGE THINGS BETTER THAN THAT SAID MERRY WE CANT BEGIN LIFE AT CRICKHOLLOW WITH A QUARREL OVER BATHS IN THAT ROOM THERE ARE THREE TUBS AND A COPPER FULL OF BOILING WATER THERE ARE ALSO TOWELS MATS AND SOAP GET INSIDE AND BE QUICK
MERRY AND FATTY WENT INTO THE KITCHEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PASSAGE AND BUSIED THEMSELVES WITH THE FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR A LATE SUPPER SNATCHES OF COMPETING SONGS CAME FROM THE BATHROOM MIXED WITH THE SOUND OF SPLASHING AND WALLOWING THE VOICE OF PIPPIN WAS SUDDENLY LIFTED UP ABOVE THE OTHERS IN ONE OF BILBOS FAVOURITE BATHSONGS
SING HEY FOR THE BATH AT CLOSE OF DAY
THAT WASHES THE WEARY MUD AWAY
A LOON IS HE THAT WILL NOT SING
O WATER HOT IS A NOBLE THING

O SWEET IS THE SOUND OF FALLING RAIN
AND THE BROOK THAT LEAPS FROM HILL TO PLAIN
BUT BETTER THAN RAIN OR RIPPLING STREAMS
IS WATER HOT THAT SMOKES AND STEAMS

O WATER COLD WE MAY POUR AT NEED
DOWN A THIRSTY THROAT AND BE GLAD INDEED
BUT BETTER IS BEER IF DRINK WE LACK
AND WATER HOT POURED DOWN THE BACK

O WATER IS FAIR THAT LEAPS ON HIGH
IN A FOUNTAIN WHITE BENEATH THE SKY
BUT NEVER DID FOUNTAIN SOUND SO SWEET
AS SPLASHING HOT WATER WITH MY FEET

THERE WAS A TERRIFIC SPLASH AND A SHOUT OF WHOA FROM FRODO IT APPEARED THAT A LOT OF PIPPINS BATH HAD IMITATED A FOUNTAIN AND LEAPED ON HIGH
MERRY WENT TO THE DOOR WHAT ABOUT SUPPER AND BEER IN THE THROAT HE CALLED FRODO CAME OUT DRYING HIS HAIR
THERES SO MUCH WATER IN THE AIR THAT IM COMING INTO THE KITCHEN TO FINISH HE SAID
LAWKS SAID MERRY LOOKING IN THE STONE FLOOR WAS SWIMMING YOU OUGHT TO MOP ALL THAT UP BEFORE YOU GET ANYTHING TO EAT PEREGRIN HE SAID HURRY UP OR WE SHANT WAIT FOR YOU
THEY HAD SUPPER IN THE KITCHEN ON A TABLE NEAR THE FIRE I SUPPOSE YOU THREE WONT WANT MUSHROOMS AGAIN SAID FREDEGAR WITHOUT MUCH HOPE
YES WE SHALL CRIED PIPPIN
THEYRE MINE SAID FRODO GIVEN TO ME BY MRS MAGGOT A QUEEN AMONG FARMERS WIVES TAKE YOUR GREEDY HANDS AWAY AND ILL SERVE THEM
HOBBITS HAVE A PASSION FOR MUSHROOMS SURPASSING EVEN THE GREEDIEST LIKINGS OF BIG PEOPLE A FACT WHICH PARTLY EXPLAINS YOUNG FRODOS LONG EXPEDITIONS TO THE RENOWNED FIELDS OF THE MARISH AND THE WRATH OF THE INJURED MAGGOT ON THIS OCCASION THERE WAS PLENTY FOR ALL EVEN ACCORDING TO HOBBIT STANDARDS THERE WERE ALSO MANY OTHER THINGS TO FOLLOW AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED EVEN FATTY BOLGER HEAVED A SIGH OF CONTENT THEY PUSHED BACK THE TABLE AND DREW CHAIRS ROUND THE FIRE
WELL CLEAR UP LATER SAID MERRY NOW TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I GUESS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HAVING ADVENTURES WHICH WAS NOT QUITE FAIR WITHOUT ME I WANT A FULL ACCOUNT AND MOST OF ALL I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH OLD MAGGOT AND WHY HE SPOKE TO ME LIKE THAT HE SOUNDED ALMOST AS IF HE WAS SCARED IF THAT IS POSSIBLE
WE HAVE ALL BEEN SCARED SAID PIPPIN AFTER A PAUSE IN WHICH FRODO STARED AT THE FIRE AND DID NOT SPEAK YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO IF YOU HAD BEEN CHASED FOR TWO DAYS BY BLACK RIDERS
AND WHAT ARE THEY
BLACK FIGURES RIDING ON BLACK HORSES ANSWERED PIPPIN IF FRODO WONT TALK I WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE TALE FROM THE BEGINNING HE THEN GAVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THEIR JOURNEY FROM THE TIME WHEN THEY LEFT HOBBITON SAM GAVE VARIOUS SUPPORTING NODS AND EXCLAMATIONS FRODO REMAINED SILENT
I SHOULD THINK YOU WERE MAKING IT ALL UP SAID MERRY IF I HAD NOT SEEN THAT BLACK SHAPE ON THE LANDINGSTAGE  AND HEARD THE QUEER SOUND IN MAGGOTS VOICE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT ALL FRODO
COUSIN FRODO HAS BEEN VERY CLOSE SAID PIPPIN BUT THE TIME HAS COME FOR HIM TO OPEN OUT SO FAR WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN NOTHING MORE TO GO ON THAN FARMER MAGGOTS GUESS THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH OLD BILBOS TREASURE
THAT WAS ONLY A GUESS SAID FRODO HASTILY MAGGOT DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING
OLD MAGGOT IS A SHREWD FELLOW SAID MERRY A LOT GOES ON BEHIND HIS ROUND FACE THAT DOES NOT COME OUT IN HIS TALK IVE HEARD THAT HE USED TO GO INTO THE OLD FOREST AT ONE TIME AND HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF KNOWING A GOOD MANY STRANGE THINGS BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST TELL US FRODO WHETHER YOU THINK HIS GUESS GOOD OR BAD
I THINK ANSWERED FRODO SLOWLY THAT IT WAS A GOOD GUESS AS FAR AS IT GOES THERE IS A CONNEXION WITH BILBOS OLD ADVENTURES AND THE RIDERS ARE LOOKING OR PERHAPS ONE OUGHT TO SAY SEARCHING FOR HIM OR FOR ME I ALSO FEAR IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT IT IS NO JOKE AT ALL AND THAT I AM NOT SAFE HERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE HE LOOKED ROUND AT THE WINDOWS AND WALLS AS IF HE WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD SUDDENLY GIVE WAY THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENCE AND EXCHANGED MEANING GLANCES AMONG THEMSELVES
ITS COMING OUT IN A MINUTE WHISPERED PIPPIN TO MERRY MERRY NODDED
WELL SAID FRODO AT LAST SITTING UP AND STRAIGHTENING HIS BACK AS IF HE HAD MADE A DECISION I CANT KEEP IT DARK ANY LONGER I HAVE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU ALL BUT I DONT KNOW QUITE HOW TO BEGIN

OF COURSE WE UNDERSTAND SAID MERRY FIRMLY THAT IS WHY WE HAVE DECIDED TO COME WE KNOW THE RING IS NO LAUGHINGMATTER BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO HELP YOU AGAINST THE ENEMY
THE RING SAID FRODO NOW COMPLETELY AMAZED
YES THE RING SAID MERRY MY DEAR OLD HOBBIT YOU DONT ALLOW FOR THE INQUISITIVENESS OF FRIENDS I HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE RING FOR YEARS  BEFORE BILBO WENT AWAY IN FACT BUT SINCE HE OBVIOUSLY REGARDED IT AS SECRET I KEPT THE KNOWLEDGE IN MY HEAD UNTIL WE FORMED OUR CONSPIRACY I DID NOT KNOW BILBO OF COURSE AS WELL AS I KNOW YOU I WAS TOO YOUNG AND HE WAS ALSO MORE CAREFUL  BUT HE WAS NOT CAREFUL ENOUGH IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I FIRST FOUND OUT I WILL TELL YOU
GO ON SAID FRODO FAINTLY
IT WAS THE SACKVILLEBAGGINSES THAT WERE HIS DOWNFALL AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT ONE DAY A YEAR BEFORE THE PARTY I HAPPENED TO BE WALKING ALONG THE ROAD WHEN I SAW BILBO AHEAD SUDDENLY IN THE DISTANCE THE SBS APPEARED COMING TOWARDS US BILBO SLOWED DOWN AND THEN HEY PRESTO HE VANISHED I WAS SO STARTLED THAT I HARDLY HAD THE WITS TO HIDE MYSELF IN A MORE ORDINARY FASHION BUT I GOT THROUGH THE HEDGE AND WALKED ALONG THE FIELD INSIDE I WAS PEEPING THROUGH INTO THE ROAD AFTER THE SBS HAD PASSED AND WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT BILBO WHEN HE SUDDENLY REAPPEARED I CAUGHT A GLINT OF GOLD AS HE PUT SOMETHING BACK IN HIS TROUSERPOCKET
AFTER THAT I KEPT MY EYES OPEN IN FACT I CONFESS THAT I SPIED BUT YOU MUST ADMIT THAT IT WAS VERY INTRIGUING AND I WAS ONLY IN MY TEENS I MUST BE THE ONLY ONE IN THE SHIRE BESIDES YOU FRODO THAT HAS EVER SEEN THE OLD FELLOWS SECRET BOOK
YOU HAVE READ HIS BOOK CRIED FRODO GOOD HEAVENS ABOVE IS NOTHING SAFE
NOT TOO SAFE I SHOULD SAY SAID MERRY BUT I HAVE ONLY HAD ONE RAPID GLANCE AND THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET HE NEVER LEFT THE BOOK ABOUT I WONDER WHAT BECAME OF IT I SHOULD LIKE ANOTHER LOOK HAVE YOU GOT IT FRODO
NO IT WAS NOT AT BAG END HE MUST HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY
WELL AS I WAS SAYING MERRY PROCEEDED I KEPT MY KNOWLEDGE TO MYSELF TILL THIS SPRING WHEN THINGS GOT SERIOUS THEN WE FORMED OUR CONSPIRACY AND AS WE WERE SERIOUS TOO AND MEANT BUSINESS WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOO SCRUPULOUS YOU ARE NOT A VERY EASY NUT TO CRACK AND GANDALF IS WORSE BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE INTRODUCED TO OUR CHIEF INVESTIGATOR I CAN PRODUCE HIM
WHERE IS HE SAID FRODO LOOKING ROUND AS IF HE EXPECTED A MASKED AND SINISTER FIGURE TO COME OUT OF A CUPBOARD
STEP FORWARD SAM SAID MERRY AND SAM STOOD UP WITH A FACE SCARLET UP TO THE EARS HERES OUR COLLECTOR OF INFORMATION AND HE COLLECTED A LOT I CAN TELL YOU BEFORE HE WAS FINALLY CAUGHT AFTER WHICH I MAY SAY HE SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF AS ON PAROLE AND DRIED UP
SAM CRIED FRODO FEELING THAT AMAZEMENT COULD GO NO FURTHER AND QUITE UNABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER HE FELT ANGRY AMUSED RELIEVED OR MERELY FOOLISH
YES SIR SAID SAM BEGGING YOUR PARDON SIR BUT I MEANT NO WRONG TO YOU MR FRODO NOR TO MR GANDALF FOR THAT MATTER HE HAS SOME SENSE MIND YOU AND WHEN YOU SAID GO ALONE HE SAID NO TAKE SOMEONE AS YOU CAN TRUST
BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT I CAN TRUST ANYONE SAID FRODO SAM LOOKED AT HIM UNHAPPILY
IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT PUT IN MERRY YOU CAN TRUST US TO STICK TO YOU THROUGH THICK AND THIN  TO THE BITTER END AND YOU CAN TRUST US TO KEEP ANY SECRET OF YOURS  CLOSER THAN YOU KEEP IT YOURSELF BUT YOU CANNOT TRUST US TO LET YOU FACE TROUBLE ALONE AND GO OFF WITHOUT A WORD WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS FRODO ANYWAY THERE IT IS WE KNOW MOST OF WHAT GANDALF HAS TOLD YOU WE KNOW A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THE RING WE ARE HORRIBLY AFRAID  BUT WE ARE COMING WITH YOU OR FOLLOWING YOU LIKE HOUNDS
AND AFTER ALL SIR ADDED SAM YOU DID OUGHT TO TAKE THE ELVES ADVICE GILDOR SAID YOU SHOULD TAKE THEM AS WAS WILLING AND YOU CANT DENY IT
I DONT DENY IT SAID FRODO LOOKING AT SAM WHO WAS NOW GRINNING I DONT DENY IT BUT ILL NEVER BELIEVE YOU ARE SLEEPING AGAIN WHETHER YOU SNORE OR NOT I SHALL KICK YOU HARD TO MAKE SURE
YOU ARE A SET OF DECEITFUL SCOUNDRELS HE SAID TURNING TO THE OTHERS BUT BLESS YOU HE LAUGHED GETTING UP AND WAVING HIS ARMS I GIVE IN I WILL TAKE GILDORS ADVICE IF THE DANGER WERE NOT SO DARK I SHOULD DANCE FOR JOY EVEN SO I CANNOT HELP FEELING HAPPY HAPPIER THAN I HAVE FELT FOR A LONG TIME I HAD DREADED THIS EVENING
GOOD THATS SETTLED THREE CHEERS FOR CAPTAIN FRODO AND COMPANY THEY SHOUTED AND THEY DANCED ROUND HIM MERRY AND PIPPIN BEGAN A SONG WHICH THEY HAD APPARENTLY GOT READY FOR THE OCCASION
IT WAS MADE ON THE MODEL OF THE DWARFSONG THAT STARTED BILBO ON HIS ADVENTURE LONG AGO AND WENT TO THE SAME TUNE
FAREWELL WE CALL TO HEARTH AND HALL
THOUGH WIND MAY BLOW AND RAIN MAY FALL
WE MUST AWAY ERE BREAK OF DAY
FAR OVER WOOD AND MOUNTAIN TALL

TO RIVENDELL WHERE ELVES YET DWELL
IN GLADES BENEATH THE MISTY FELL
THROUGH MOOR AND WASTE WE RIDE IN HASTE
AND WHITHER THEN WE CANNOT TELL

WITH FOES AHEAD BEHIND US DREAD
BENEATH THE SKY SHALL BE OUR BED
UNTIL AT LAST OUR TOIL BE PASSED
OUR JOURNEY DONE OUR ERRAND SPED

WE MUST AWAY WE MUST AWAY
WE RIDE BEFORE THE BREAK OF DAY

VERY GOOD SAID FRODO BUT IN THAT CASE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO BEFORE WE GO TO BED  UNDER A ROOF FOR TONIGHT AT ANY RATE
OH THAT WAS POETRY SAID PIPPIN DO YOU REALLY MEAN TO START BEFORE THE BREAK OF DAY
I DONT KNOW ANSWERED FRODO I FEAR THOSE BLACK RIDERS AND I AM SURE IT IS UNSAFE TO STAY IN ONE PLACE LONG ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE TO WHICH IT IS KNOWN I WAS GOING ALSO GILDOR ADVISED ME NOT TO WAIT BUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE GANDALF I COULD SEE THAT EVEN GILDOR WAS DISTURBED WHEN HE HEARD THAT GANDALF HAD NEVER APPEARED IT REALLY DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS HOW SOON COULD THE RIDERS GET TO BUCKLEBURY AND HOW SOON COULD WE GET OFF IT WILL TAKE A GOOD DEAL OF PREPARATION
THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION SAID MERRY IS THAT WE COULD GET OFF IN AN HOUR I HAVE PREPARED PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING THERE ARE SIX PONIES IN A STABLE ACROSS THE FIELDS STORES AND TACKLE ARE ALL PACKED EXCEPT FOR A FEW EXTRA CLOTHES AND THE PERISHABLE FOOD
IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A VERY EFFICIENT CONSPIRACY SAID FRODO BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BLACK RIDERS WOULD IT BE SAFE TO WAIT ONE DAY FOR GANDALF
THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK THE RIDERS WOULD DO IF THEY FOUND YOU HERE ANSWERED MERRY THEY COULD HAVE REACHED HERE BY NOW OF COURSE IF THEY WERE NOT STOPPED AT THE NORTHGATE WHERE THE HEDGE RUNS DOWN TO THE RIVERBANK JUST THIS SIDE OF THE BRIDGE THE GATEGUARDS WOULD NOT LET THEM THROUGH BY NIGHT THOUGH THEY MIGHT BREAK THROUGH EVEN IN THE DAYLIGHT THEY WOULD TRY TO KEEP THEM OUT I THINK AT ANY RATE UNTIL THEY GOT A MESSAGE THROUGH TO THE MASTER OF THE HALL  FOR THEY WOULD NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THE RIDERS AND WOULD CERTAINLY BE FRIGHTENED BY THEM BUT OF COURSE BUCKLAND CANNOT RESIST A DETERMINED ATTACK FOR LONG AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN THE MORNING EVEN A BLACK RIDER THAT RODE UP AND ASKED FOR MR BAGGINS WOULD BE LET THROUGH IT IS PRETTY GENERALLY KNOWN THAT YOU ARE COMING BACK TO LIVE AT CRICKHOLLOW
FRODO SAT FOR A WHILE IN THOUGHT I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND HE SAID FINALLY I AM STARTING TOMORROW AS SOON AS IT IS LIGHT BUT I AM NOT GOING BY ROAD IT WOULD BE SAFER TO WAIT HERE THAN THAT IF I GO THROUGH THE NORTHGATE MY DEPARTURE FROM BUCKLAND WILL BE KNOWN AT ONCE INSTEAD OF BEING SECRET FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT LEAST AS IT MIGHT BE AND WHAT IS MORE THE BRIDGE AND THE EAST ROAD NEAR THE BORDERS WILL CERTAINLY BE WATCHED WHETHER ANY RIDER GETS INTO BUCKLAND OR NOT WE DONT KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO AND POSSIBLY MORE THE ONLY THING TO DO IS TO GO OFF IN A QUITE UNEXPECTED DIRECTION
BUT THAT CAN ONLY MEAN GOING INTO THE OLD FOREST SAID FREDEGAR HORRIFIED YOU CANT BE THINKING OF DOING THAT IT IS QUITE AS DANGEROUS AS BLACK RIDERS
NOT QUITE SAID MERRY IT SOUNDS VERY DESPERATE BUT I BELIEVE FRODO IS RIGHT IT IS THE ONLY WAY OF GETTING OFF WITHOUT BEING FOLLOWED AT ONCE WITH LUCK WE MIGHT GET A CONSIDERABLE START
BUT YOU WONT HAVE ANY LUCK IN THE OLD FOREST OBJECTED FREDEGAR NO ONE EVER HAS LUCK IN THERE YOULL GET LOST PEOPLE DONT GO IN THERE
OH YES THEY DO SAID MERRY THE BRANDYBUCKS GO IN  OCCASIONALLY WHEN THE FIT TAKES THEM WE HAVE A PRIVATE ENTRANCE FRODO WENT IN ONCE LONG AGO I HAVE BEEN IN SEVERAL TIMES USUALLY IN DAYLIGHT OF COURSE WHEN THE TREES ARE SLEEPY AND FAIRLY QUIET
WELL DO AS YOU THINK BEST SAID FREDEGAR I AM MORE AFRAID OF THE OLD FOREST THAN OF ANYTHING I KNOW ABOUT THE STORIES ABOUT IT ARE A NIGHTMARE BUT MY VOTE HARDLY COUNTS AS I AM NOT GOING ON THE JOURNEY STILL I AM VERY GLAD SOMEONE IS STOPPING BEHIND WHO CAN TELL GANDALF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WHEN HE TURNS UP AS I AM SURE HE WILL BEFORE LONG
FOND AS HE WAS OF FRODO FATTY BOLGER HAD NO DESIRE TO LEAVE THE SHIRE NOR TO SEE WHAT LAY OUTSIDE IT HIS FAMILY CAME FROM THE EASTFARTHING FROM BUDGEFORD IN BRIDGEFIELDS IN FACT BUT HE HAD NEVER BEEN OVER THE BRANDYWINE BRIDGE HIS TASK ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL PLANS OF THE CONSPIRATORS WAS TO STAY BEHIND AND DEAL WITH INQUISITIVE FOLK AND TO KEEP UP AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THE PRETENCE THAT MR BAGGINS WAS STILL LIVING AT CRICKHOLLOW HE HAD EVEN BROUGHT ALONG SOME OLD CLOTHES OF FRODOS TO HELP HIM IN PLAYING THE PART THEY LITTLE THOUGHT HOW DANGEROUS THAT PART MIGHT PROVE
EXCELLENT SAID FRODO WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THE PLAN WE COULD NOT HAVE LEFT ANY MESSAGE BEHIND FOR GANDALF OTHERWISE I DONT KNOW WHETHER THESE RIDERS CAN READ OR NOT OF COURSE BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO RISK A WRITTEN MESSAGE IN CASE THEY GOT IN AND SEARCHED THE HOUSE BUT IF FATTY IS WILLING TO HOLD THE FORT AND I CAN BE SURE OF GANDALF KNOWING THE WAY WE HAVE GONE THAT DECIDES ME I AM GOING INTO THE OLD FOREST FIRST THING TOMORROW
WELL THATS THAT SAID PIPPIN ON THE WHOLE I WOULD RATHER HAVE OUR JOB THAN FATTYS  WAITING HERE TILL BLACK RIDERS COME
YOU WAIT TILL YOU ARE WELL INSIDE THE FOREST SAID FREDEGAR YOULL WISH YOU WERE BACK HERE WITH ME BEFORE THIS TIME TOMORROW
ITS NO GOOD ARGUING ABOUT IT ANY MORE SAID MERRY WE HAVE STILL GOT TO TIDY UP AND PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE PACKING BEFORE WE GET TO BED I SHALL CALL YOU ALL BEFORE THE BREAK OF DAY
WHEN AT LAST HE HAD GOT TO BED FRODO COULD NOT SLEEP FOR SOME TIME HIS LEGS ACHED HE WAS GLAD THAT HE WAS RIDING IN THE MORNING EVENTUALLY HE FELL INTO A VAGUE DREAM IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING OUT OF A HIGH WINDOW OVER A DARK SEA OF TANGLED TREES DOWN BELOW AMONG THE ROOTS THERE WAS THE SOUND OF CREATURES CRAWLING AND SNUFFLING HE FELT SURE THEY WOULD SMELL HIM OUT SOONER OR LATER
THEN HE HEARD A NOISE IN THE DISTANCE AT FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT WIND COMING OVER THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST THEN HE KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT LEAVES BUT THE SOUND OF THE SEA FAROFF A SOUND HE HAD NEVER HEARD IN WAKING LIFE THOUGH IT HAD OFTEN TROUBLED HIS DREAMS SUDDENLY HE FOUND HE WAS OUT IN THE OPEN THERE WERE NO TREES AFTER ALL HE WAS ON A DARK HEATH AND THERE WAS A STRANGE SALT SMELL IN THE AIR LOOKING UP HE SAW BEFORE HIM A TALL WHITE TOWER STANDING ALONE ON A HIGH RIDGE A GREAT DESIRE CAME OVER HIM TO CLIMB THE TOWER AND SEE THE SEA HE STARTED TO STRUGGLE UP THE RIDGE TOWARDS THE TOWER BUT SUDDENLY A LIGHT CAME IN THE SKY AND THERE WAS A NOISE OF THUNDER



CHAPTER 6
THE OLD FOREST

FRODO WOKE SUDDENLY IT WAS STILL DARK IN THE ROOM MERRY WAS STANDING THERE WITH A CANDLE IN ONE HAND AND BANGING ON THE DOOR WITH THE OTHER ALL RIGHT WHAT IS IT SAID FRODO STILL SHAKEN AND BEWILDERED
WHAT IS IT CRIED MERRY IT IS TIME TO GET UP IT IS HALF PAST FOUR AND VERY FOGGY COME ON SAM IS ALREADY GETTING BREAKFAST READY EVEN PIPPIN IS UP I AM JUST GOING TO SADDLE THE PONIES AND FETCH THE ONE THAT IS TO BE THE BAGGAGECARRIER WAKE THAT SLUGGARD FATTY AT LEAST HE MUST GET UP AND SEE US OFF
SOON AFTER SIX OCLOCK THE FIVE HOBBITS WERE READY TO START FATTY BOLGER WAS STILL YAWNING THEY STOLE QUIETLY OUT OF THE HOUSE MERRY WENT IN FRONT LEADING A LADEN PONY AND TOOK HIS WAY ALONG A PATH THAT WENT THROUGH A SPINNEY BEHIND THE HOUSE AND THEN CUT ACROSS SEVERAL FIELDS THE LEAVES OF TREES WERE GLISTENING AND EVERY TWIG WAS DRIPPING THE GRASS WAS GREY WITH COLD DEW EVERYTHING WAS STILL AND FARAWAY NOISES SEEMED NEAR AND CLEAR FOWLS CHATTERING IN A YARD SOMEONE CLOSING A DOOR OF A DISTANT HOUSE
IN THEIR SHED THEY FOUND THE PONIES STURDY LITTLE BEASTS OF THE KIND LOVED BY HOBBITS NOT SPEEDY BUT GOOD FOR A LONG DAYS WORK THEY MOUNTED AND SOON THEY WERE RIDING OFF INTO THE MIST WHICH SEEMED TO OPEN RELUCTANTLY BEFORE THEM AND CLOSE FORBIDDINGLY BEHIND THEM AFTER RIDING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR SLOWLY AND WITHOUT TALKING THEY SAW THE HEDGE LOOMING SUDDENLY AHEAD IT WAS TALL AND NETTED OVER WITH SILVER COBWEBS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS ASKED FREDEGAR FOLLOW ME SAID MERRY AND YOU WILL SEE HE TURNED TO THE LEFT ALONG THE HEDGE AND SOON THEY CAME TO A POINT WHERE IT BENT INWARDS RUNNING ALONG THE LIP OF A HOLLOW A CUTTING HAD BEEN MADE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HEDGE AND WENT SLOPING GENTLY DOWN INTO THE GROUND IT HAD WALLS OF BRICK AT THE SIDES WHICH ROSE STEADILY UNTIL SUDDENLY THEY ARCHED OVER AND FORMED A TUNNEL THAT DIVED DEEP UNDER THE HEDGE AND CAME OUT IN THE HOLLOW ON THE OTHER SIDE
HERE FATTY BOLGER HALTED GOODBYE FRODO HE SAID I WISH YOU WERE NOT GOING INTO THE FOREST I ONLY HOPE YOU WILL NOT NEED RESCUING BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT BUT GOOD LUCK TO YOU  TODAY AND EVERY DAY
IF THERE ARE NO WORSE THINGS AHEAD THAN THE OLD FOREST I SHALL BE LUCKY SAID FRODO TELL GANDALF TO HURRY ALONG THE EAST ROAD WE SHALL SOON BE BACK ON IT AND GOING AS FAST AS WE CAN GOODBYE THEY CRIED AND RODE DOWN THE SLOPE AND DISAPPEARED FROM FREDEGARS SIGHT INTO THE TUNNEL
IT WAS DARK AND DAMP AT THE FAR END IT WAS CLOSED BY A GATE OF THICKSET IRON BARS MERRY GOT DOWN AND UNLOCKED THE GATE AND WHEN THEY HAD ALL PASSED THROUGH HE PUSHED IT TO AGAIN IT SHUT WITH A CLANG AND THE LOCK CLICKED THE SOUND WAS OMINOUS
THERE SAID MERRY YOU HAVE LEFT THE SHIRE AND ARE NOW OUTSIDE AND ON THE EDGE OF THE OLD FOREST
ARE THE STORIES ABOUT IT TRUE ASKED PIPPIN
I DONT KNOW WHAT STORIES YOU MEAN MERRY ANSWERED IF YOU MEAN THE OLD BOGEYSTORIES FATTYS NURSES USED TO TELL HIM ABOUT GOBLINS AND WOLVES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT I SHOULD SAY NO AT ANY RATE I DONT BELIEVE THEM BUT THE FOREST IS QUEER EVERYTHING IN IT IS VERY MUCH MORE ALIVE MORE AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON SO TO SPEAK THAN THINGS ARE IN THE SHIRE AND THE TREES DO NOT LIKE STRANGERS THEY WATCH YOU THEY ARE USUALLY CONTENT MERELY TO WATCH YOU AS LONG AS DAYLIGHT LASTS AND DONT DO MUCH OCCASIONALLY THE MOST UNFRIENDLY ONES MAY DROP A BRANCH OR STICK A ROOT OUT OR GRASP AT YOU WITH A LONG TRAILER BUT AT NIGHT THINGS CAN BE MOST ALARMING OR SO I AM TOLD I HAVE ONLY ONCE OR TWICE BEEN IN HERE AFTER DARK AND THEN ONLY NEAR THE HEDGE I THOUGHT ALL THE TREES WERE WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER PASSING NEWS AND PLOTS ALONG IN AN UNINTELLIGIBLE LANGUAGE AND THE BRANCHES SWAYED AND GROPED WITHOUT ANY WIND THEY DO SAY THE TREES DO ACTUALLY MOVE AND CAN SURROUND STRANGERS AND HEM THEM IN IN FACT LONG AGO THEY ATTACKED THE HEDGE THEY CAME AND PLANTED THEMSELVES RIGHT BY IT AND LEANED OVER IT BUT THE HOBBITS CAME AND CUT DOWN HUNDREDS OF TREES AND MADE A GREAT BONFIRE IN THE FOREST AND BURNED ALL THE GROUND IN A LONG STRIP EAST OF THE HEDGE AFTER THAT THE TREES GAVE UP THE ATTACK BUT THEY BECAME VERY UNFRIENDLY THERE IS STILL A WIDE BARE SPACE NOT FAR INSIDE WHERE THE BONFIRE WAS MADE
IS IT ONLY THE TREES THAT ARE DANGEROUS ASKED PIPPIN
THERE ARE VARIOUS QUEER THINGS LIVING DEEP IN THE FOREST AND ON THE FAR SIDE SAID MERRY OR AT LEAST I HAVE HEARD SO BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THEM BUT SOMETHING MAKES PATHS WHENEVER ONE COMES INSIDE ONE FINDS OPEN TRACKS BUT THEY SEEM TO SHIFT AND CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME IN A QUEER FASHION NOT FAR FROM THIS TUNNEL THERE IS OR WAS FOR A LONG TIME THE BEGINNING OF QUITE A BROAD PATH LEADING TO THE BONFIRE GLADE AND THEN ON MORE OR LESS IN OUR DIRECTION EAST AND A LITTLE NORTH THAT IS THE PATH I AM GOING TO TRY AND FIND
THE HOBBITS NOW LEFT THE TUNNELGATE AND RODE ACROSS THE WIDE HOLLOW ON THE FAR SIDE WAS A FAINT PATH LEADING UP ON TO THE FLOOR OF THE FOREST A HUNDRED YARDS AND MORE BEYOND THE HEDGE BUT IT VANISHED AS SOON AS IT BROUGHT THEM UNDER THE TREES LOOKING BACK THEY COULD SEE THE DARK LINE OF THE HEDGE THROUGH THE STEMS OF TREES THAT WERE ALREADY THICK ABOUT THEM LOOKING AHEAD THEY COULD SEE ONLY TREETRUNKS OF INNUMERABLE SIZES AND SHAPES STRAIGHT OR BENT TWISTED LEANING SQUAT OR SLENDER SMOOTH OR GNARLED AND BRANCHED AND ALL THE STEMS WERE GREEN OR GREY WITH MOSS AND SLIMY SHAGGY GROWTHS
MERRY ALONE SEEMED FAIRLY CHEERFUL YOU HAD BETTER LEAD ON AND FIND THAT PATH FRODO SAID TO HIM DONT LET US LOSE ONE ANOTHER OR FORGET WHICH WAY THE HEDGE LIES
THEY PICKED A WAY AMONG THE TREES AND THEIR PONIES PLODDED ALONG CAREFULLY AVOIDING THE MANY WRITHING AND INTERLACING ROOTS THERE WAS NO UNDERGROWTH THE GROUND WAS RISING STEADILY AND AS THEY WENT FORWARD IT SEEMED THAT THE TREES BECAME TALLER DARKER AND THICKER THERE WAS NO SOUND EXCEPT AN OCCASIONAL DRIP OF MOISTURE FALLING THROUGH THE STILL LEAVES FOR THE MOMENT THERE WAS NO WHISPERING OR MOVEMENT AMONG THE BRANCHES BUT THEY ALL GOT AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THEY WERE BEING WATCHED WITH DISAPPROVAL DEEPENING TO DISLIKE AND EVEN ENMITY THE FEELING STEADILY GREW UNTIL THEY FOUND THEMSELVES LOOKING UP QUICKLY OR GLANCING BACK OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AS IF THEY EXPECTED A SUDDEN BLOW
THERE WAS NOT AS YET ANY SIGN OF A PATH AND THE TREES SEEMED CONSTANTLY TO BAR THEIR WAY PIPPIN SUDDENLY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR IT ANY LONGER AND WITHOUT WARNING LET OUT A SHOUT OI OI HE CRIED I AM NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING JUST LET ME PASS THROUGH WILL YOU
THE OTHERS HALTED STARTLED BUT THE CRY FELL AS IF MUFFLED BY A HEAVY CURTAIN THERE WAS NO ECHO OR ANSWER THOUGH THE WOOD SEEMED TO BECOME MORE CROWDED AND MORE WATCHFUL THAN BEFORE
I SHOULD NOT SHOUT IF I WERE YOU SAID MERRY IT DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD
FRODO BEGAN TO WONDER IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO FIND A WAY THROUGH AND IF HE HAD BEEN RIGHT TO MAKE THE OTHERS COME INTO THIS ABOMINABLE WOOD MERRY WAS LOOKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND SEEMED ALREADY UNCERTAIN WHICH WAY TO GO PIPPIN NOTICED IT IT HAS NOT TAKEN YOU LONG TO LOSE US HE SAID BUT AT THAT MOMENT MERRY GAVE A WHISTLE OF RELIEF AND POINTED AHEAD
WELL WELL HE SAID THESE TREES DO SHIFT THERE IS THE BONFIRE GLADE IN FRONT OF US OR I HOPE SO BUT THE PATH TO IT SEEMS TO HAVE MOVED AWAY
THE LIGHT GREW CLEARER AS THEY WENT FORWARD SUDDENLY THEY CAME OUT OF THE TREES AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN A WIDE CIRCULAR SPACE THERE WAS SKY ABOVE THEM BLUE AND CLEAR TO THEIR SURPRISE FOR DOWN UNDER THE FORESTROOF THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE RISING MORNING AND THE LIFTING OF THE MIST THE SUN WAS NOT HOWEVER HIGH ENOUGH YET TO SHINE DOWN INTO THE CLEARING THOUGH ITS LIGHT WAS ON THE TREETOPS THE LEAVES WERE ALL THICKER AND GREENER ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE GLADE ENCLOSING IT WITH AN ALMOST SOLID WALL NO TREE GREW THERE ONLY ROUGH GRASS AND MANY TALL PLANTS STALKY AND FADED HEMLOCKS AND WOODPARSLEY FIREWEED SEEDING INTO FLUFFY ASHES AND RAMPANT NETTLES AND THISTLES A DREARY PLACE BUT IT SEEMED A CHARMING AND CHEERFUL GARDEN AFTER THE CLOSE FOREST
THE HOBBITS FELT ENCOURAGED AND LOOKED UP HOPEFULLY AT THE BROADENING DAYLIGHT IN THE SKY AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE GLADE THERE WAS A BREAK IN THE WALL OF TREES AND A CLEAR PATH BEYOND IT THEY COULD SEE IT RUNNING ON INTO THE WOOD WIDE IN PLACES AND OPEN ABOVE THOUGH EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THE TREES DREW IN AND OVERSHADOWED IT WITH THEIR DARK BOUGHS UP THIS PATH THEY RODE THEY WERE STILL CLIMBING GENTLY BUT THEY NOW WENT MUCH QUICKER AND WITH BETTER HEART FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THE FOREST HAD RELENTED AND WAS GOING TO LET THEM PASS UNHINDERED AFTER ALL
BUT AFTER A WHILE THE AIR BEGAN TO GET HOT AND STUFFY THE TREES DREW CLOSE AGAIN ON EITHER SIDE AND THEY COULD NO LONGER SEE FAR AHEAD NOW STRONGER THAN EVER THEY FELT AGAIN THE ILL WILL OF THE WOOD PRESSING ON THEM SO SILENT WAS IT THAT THE FALL OF THEIR PONIES HOOFS RUSTLING ON DEAD LEAVES AND OCCASIONALLY STUMBLING ON HIDDEN ROOTS SEEMED TO THUD IN THEIR EARS FRODO TRIED TO SING A SONG TO ENCOURAGE THEM BUT HIS VOICE SANK TO A MURMUR
O WANDERERS IN THE SHADOWED LAND
DESPAIR NOT FOR THOUGH DARK THEY STAND
ALL WOODS THERE BE MUST END AT LAST
AND SEE THE OPEN SUN GO PAST
THE SETTING SUN THE RISING SUN
THE DAYS END OR THE DAY BEGUN
FOR EAST OR WEST ALL WOODS MUST FAIL

FAIL  EVEN AS HE SAID THE WORD HIS VOICE FADED INTO SILENCE THE AIR SEEMED HEAVY AND THE MAKING OF WORDS WEARISOME JUST BEHIND THEM A LARGE BRANCH FELL FROM AN OLD OVERHANGING TREE WITH A CRASH INTO THE PATH THE TREES SEEMED TO CLOSE IN BEFORE THEM
THEY DO NOT LIKE ALL THAT ABOUT ENDING AND FAILING SAID MERRY I SHOULD NOT SING ANY MORE AT PRESENT WAIT TILL WE DO GET TO THE EDGE AND THEN WELL TURN AND GIVE THEM A ROUSING CHORUS
HE SPOKE CHEERFULLY AND IF HE FELT ANY GREAT ANXIETY HE DID NOT SHOW IT THE OTHERS DID NOT ANSWER THEY WERE DEPRESSED A HEAVY WEIGHT WAS SETTLING STEADILY ON FRODOS HEART AND HE REGRETTED NOW WITH EVERY STEP FORWARD THAT HE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF CHALLENGING THE MENACE OF THE TREES HE WAS INDEED JUST ABOUT TO STOP AND PROPOSE GOING BACK IF THAT WAS STILL POSSIBLE WHEN THINGS TOOK A NEW TURN THE PATH STOPPED CLIMBING AND BECAME FOR A WHILE NEARLY LEVEL THE DARK TREES DREW ASIDE AND AHEAD THEY COULD SEE THE PATH GOING ALMOST STRAIGHT FORWARD BEFORE THEM BUT SOME DISTANCE OFF THERE STOOD A GREEN HILLTOP TREELESS RISING LIKE A BALD HEAD OUT OF THE ENCIRCLING WOOD THE PATH SEEMED TO BE MAKING DIRECTLY FOR IT
THEY NOW HURRIED FORWARD AGAIN DELIGHTED WITH THE THOUGHT OF CLIMBING OUT FOR A WHILE ABOVE THE ROOF OF THE FOREST THE PATH DIPPED AND THEN AGAIN BEGAN TO CLIMB UPWARDS LEADING THEM AT LAST TO THE FOOT OF THE STEEP HILLSIDE THERE IT LEFT THE TREES AND FADED INTO THE TURF THE WOOD STOOD ALL ROUND THE HILL LIKE THICK HAIR THAT ENDED SHARPLY IN A CIRCLE ROUND A SHAVEN CROWN
THE HOBBITS LED THEIR PONIES UP WINDING ROUND AND ROUND UNTIL THEY REACHED THE TOP THERE THEY STOOD AND GAZED ABOUT THEM THE AIR WAS GLEAMING AND SUNLIT BUT HAZY AND THEY COULD NOT SEE TO ANY GREAT DISTANCE NEAR AT HAND THE MIST WAS NOW ALMOST GONE THOUGH HERE AND THERE IT LAY IN HOLLOWS OF THE WOOD AND TO THE SOUTH OF THEM OUT OF A DEEP FOLD CUTTING RIGHT ACROSS THE FOREST THE FOG STILL ROSE LIKE STEAM OR WISPS OF WHITE SMOKE
THAT SAID MERRY POINTING WITH HIS HAND THAT IS THE LINE OF THE WITHYWINDLE IT COMES DOWN OUT OF THE DOWNS AND FLOWS SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE FOREST TO JOIN THE BRANDYWINE BELOW HAYSEND WE DONT WANT TO GO THAT WAY THE WITHYWINDLE VALLEY IS SAID TO BE THE QUEEREST PART OF THE WHOLE WOOD  THE CENTRE FROM WHICH ALL THE QUEERNESS COMES AS IT WERE
THE OTHERS LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION THAT MERRY POINTED OUT BUT THEY COULD SEE LITTLE BUT MISTS OVER THE DAMP AND DEEPCUT VALLEY AND BEYOND IT THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FOREST FADED FROM VIEW
THE SUN ON THE HILLTOP WAS NOW GETTING HOT IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT ELEVEN OCLOCK BUT THE AUTUMN HAZE STILL PREVENTED THEM FROM SEEING MUCH IN OTHER DIRECTIONS IN THE WEST THEY COULD NOT MAKE OUT EITHER THE LINE OF THE HEDGE OR THE VALLEY OF THE BRANDYWINE BEYOND IT NORTHWARD WHERE THEY LOOKED MOST HOPEFULLY THEY COULD SEE NOTHING THAT MIGHT BE THE LINE OF THE GREAT EAST ROAD FOR WHICH THEY WERE MAKING THEY WERE ON AN ISLAND IN A SEA OF TREES AND THE HORIZON WAS VEILED
ON THE SOUTHEASTERN SIDE THE GROUND FELL VERY STEEPLY AS IF THE SLOPES OF THE HILL WERE CONTINUED FAR DOWN UNDER THE TREES LIKE ISLANDSHORES THAT REALLY ARE THE SIDES OF A MOUNTAIN RISING OUT OF DEEP WATERS THEY SAT ON THE GREEN EDGE AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE WOODS BELOW THEM WHILE THEY ATE THEIR MIDDAY MEAL AS THE SUN ROSE AND PASSED NOON THEY GLIMPSED FAR OFF IN THE EAST THE GREYGREEN LINES OF THE DOWNS THAT LAY BEYOND THE OLD FOREST ON THAT SIDE THAT CHEERED THEM GREATLY FOR IT WAS GOOD TO SEE A SIGHT OF ANYTHING BEYOND THE WOODS BORDERS THOUGH THEY DID NOT MEAN TO GO THAT WAY IF THEY COULD HELP IT THE BARROWDOWNS HAD AS SINISTER A REPUTATION IN HOBBITLEGEND AS THE FOREST ITSELF
AT LENGTH THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO GO ON AGAIN THE PATH THAT HAD BROUGHT THEM TO THE HILL REAPPEARED ON THE NORTHWARD SIDE BUT THEY HAD NOT FOLLOWED IT FAR BEFORE THEY BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS BENDING STEADILY TO THE RIGHT SOON IT BEGAN TO DESCEND RAPIDLY AND THEY GUESSED THAT IT MUST ACTUALLY BE HEADING TOWARDS THE WITHYWINDLE VALLEY NOT AT ALL THE DIRECTION THEY WISHED LO TAKE AFTER SOME DISCUSSION THEY DECIDED TO LEAVE THIS MISLEADING PATH AND STRIKE NORTHWARD FOR ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT FROM THE HILLTOP THE ROAD MUST LIE THAT WAY AND IT COULD NOT BE MANY MILES OFF ALSO NORTHWARD AND TO THE LEFT OF THE PATH THE LAND SEEMED LO BE DRIER AND MORE OPEN CLIMBING UP TO SLOPES WHERE THE TREES WERE THINNER AND PINES AND FIRS REPLACED THE OAKS AND ASHES AND OTHER STRANGE AND NAMELESS TREES OF THE DENSER WOOD
AT FIRST THEIR CHOICE SEEMED TO BE GOOD THEY GOT ALONG AT A FAIR SPEED THOUGH WHENEVER THEY GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE SUN IN AN OPEN GLADE THEY SEEMED UNACCOUNTABLY TO HAVE VEERED EASTWARDS BUT AFTER A TIME THE TREES BEGAN TO CLOSE IN AGAIN JUST WHERE THEY HAD APPEARED FROM A DISTANCE TO BE THINNER AND LESS TANGLED THEN DEEP FOLDS IN THE GROUND WERE DISCOVERED UNEXPECTEDLY LIKE THE RUTS OF GREAT GIANTWHEELS OR WIDE MOATS AND SUNKEN ROADS LONG DISUSED AND CHOKED WITH BRAMBLES THESE LAY USUALLY RIGHT ACROSS THEIR LINE OF MARCH AND COULD ONLY BE CROSSED BY SCRAMBLING DOWN AND OUT AGAIN WHICH WAS TROUBLESOME AND DIFFICULT WITH THEIR PONIES EACH TIME THEY CLIMBED DOWN THEY FOUND THE HOLLOW FILLED WITH THICK BUSHES AND MATTED UNDERGROWTH WHICH SOMEHOW WOULD NOT YIELD TO THE LEFT BUT ONLY GAVE WAY WHEN THEY TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND THEY HAD TO GO SOME DISTANCE ALONG THE BOTTOM BEFORE THEY COULD FIND A WAY UP THE FURTHER BANK EACH TIME THEY CLAMBERED OUT THE TREES SEEMED DEEPER AND DARKER AND ALWAYS TO THE LEFT AND UPWARDS IT WAS MOST DIFFICULT TO FIND A WAY AND THEY WERE FORCED TO THE RIGHT AND DOWNWARDS
AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO THEY HAD LOST ALL CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION THOUGH THEY KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY HAD LONG CEASED TO GO NORTHWARD AT ALL THEY WERE BEING HEADED OFF AND WERE SIMPLY FOLLOWING A COURSE CHOSEN FOR THEM  EASTWARDS AND SOUTHWARDS INTO THE HEART OF THE FOREST AND NOT OUT OF IT
THE AFTERNOON WAS WEARING AWAY WHEN THEY SCRAMBLED AND STUMBLED INTO A FOLD THAT WAS WIDER AND DEEPER THAN ANY THEY HAD YET MET IT WAS SO SLEEP AND OVERHUNG THAT IT PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO CLIMB OUT OF IT AGAIN EITHER FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS WITHOUT LEAVING THEIR PONIES AND THEIR BAGGAGE BEHIND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO FOLLOW THE FOLD  DOWNWARDS THE GROUND GREW SOFT AND IN PLACES BOGGY SPRINGS APPEARED IN THE BANKS AND SOON THEY FOUND THEMSELVES FOLLOWING A BROOK THAT TRICKLED AND BABBLED THROUGH A WEEDY BED THEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO FALL RAPIDLY AND THE BROOK GROWING STRONG AND NOISY FLOWED AND LEAPED SWIFTLY DOWNHILL THEY WERE IN A DEEP DIMLIT GULLY OVERARCHED BY TREES HIGH ABOVE THEM
AFTER STUMBLING ALONG FOR SOME WAY ALONG THE STREAM THEY CAME QUITE SUDDENLY OUT OF THE GLOOM AS IF THROUGH A GATE THEY SAW THE SUNLIGHT BEFORE THEM COMING TO THE OPENING THEY FOUND THAT THEY HAD MADE THEIR WAY DOWN THROUGH A CLEFT IN A HIGH SLEEP BANK ALMOST A CLIFF AT ITS FEET WAS A WIDE SPACE OF GRASS AND REEDS AND IN THE DISTANCE COULD BE GLIMPSED ANOTHER BANK ALMOST AS STEEP A GOLDEN AFTERNOON OF LATE SUNSHINE LAY WARM AND DROWSY UPON THE HIDDEN LAND BETWEEN IN THE MIDST OF IT THERE WOUND LAZILY A DARK RIVER OF BROWN WATER BORDERED WITH ANCIENT WILLOWS ARCHED OVER WITH WILLOWS BLOCKED WITH FALLEN WILLOWS AND FLECKED WITH THOUSANDS OF FADED WILLOWLEAVES THE AIR WAS THICK WITH THEM FLUTTERING YELLOW FROM THE BRANCHES FOR THERE WAS A WARM AND GENTLE BREEZE BLOWING SOFTLY IN THE VALLEY AND THE REEDS WERE RUSTLING AND THE WILLOWBOUGHS WERE CREAKING
WELL NOW I HAVE AT LEAST SOME NOTION OF WHERE WE ARE SAID MERRY WE HAVE COME ALMOST IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO WHICH WE INTENDED THIS IS THE RIVER WITHYWINDLE I WILL GO ON AND EXPLORE
HE PASSED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE LONG GRASSES AFTER A WHILE HE REAPPEARED AND REPORTED THAT THERE WAS FAIRLY SOLID GROUND BETWEEN THE CLIFFFOOT AND THE RIVER IN SOME PLACES FIRM TURF WENT DOWN TO THE WATERS EDGE WHATS MORE HE SAID THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A FOOTPATH WINDING ALONG ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER IF WE TURN LEFT AND FOLLOW IT WE SHALL BE BOUND TO COME OUT ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE FOREST EVENTUALLY
I DARE SAY SAID PIPPIN THAT IS IF THE TRACK GOES ON SO FAR AND DOES NOT SIMPLY LEAD US INTO A BOG AND LEAVE US THERE WHO MADE THE TRACK DO YOU SUPPOSE AND WHY I AM SURE IT WAS NOT FOR OUR BENEFIT I AM GETTING VERY SUSPICIOUS OF THIS FOREST AND EVERYTHING IN IT AND I BEGIN TO BELIEVE ALL THE STORIES ABOUT IT AND HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW FAR EASTWARD WE SHOULD HAVE TO GO
NO SAID MERRY I HAVENT I DONT KNOW IN THE LEAST HOW FAR DOWN THE WITHYWINDLE WE ARE OR WHO COULD POSSIBLY COME HERE OFTEN ENOUGH TO MAKE A PATH ALONG IT BUT THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT THAT I CAN SEE OR THINK OF
THERE BEING NOTHING ELSE FOR IT THEY FILED OUT AND MERRY LED THEM TO THE PATH THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED EVERYWHERE THE REEDS AND GRASSES WERE LUSH AND TALL IN PLACES FAR ABOVE THEIR HEADS BUT ONCE FOUND THE PATH WAS EASY TO FOLLOW AS IT TURNED AND TWISTED PICKING OUT THE SOUNDER GROUND AMONG THE BOGS AND POOLS HERE AND THERE IT PASSED OVER OTHER RILLS RUNNING DOWN GULLIES INTO THE WITHYWINDLE OUT OF THE HIGHER FORESTLANDS AND AT THESE POINTS THERE WERE TREETRUNKS OR BUNDLES OF BRUSHWOOD LAID CAREFULLY ACROSS

THE HOBBITS BEGAN TO FEEL VERY HOT THERE WERE ARMIES OF FLIES OF ALL KINDS BUZZING ROUND THEIR EARS AND THE AFTERNOON SUN WAS BURNING ON THEIR BACKS AT LAST THEY CAME SUDDENLY INTO A THIN SHADE GREAT GREY BRANCHES REACHED ACROSS THE PATH EACH STEP FORWARD BECAME MORE RELUCTANT THAN THE LAST SLEEPINESS SEEMED TO BE CREEPING OUT OF THE GROUND AND UP THEIR LEGS AND FALLING SOFTLY OUT OF THE AIR UPON THEIR HEADS AND EYES
FRODO FELT HIS CHIN GO DOWN AND HIS HEAD NOD JUST IN FRONT OF HIM PIPPIN FELL FORWARD ON TO HIS KNEES FRODO HALTED ITS NO GOOD HE HEARD MERRY SAYING CANT GO ANOTHER STEP WITHOUT REST MUST HAVE NAP ITS COOL UNDER THE WILLOWS LESS FLIES
FRODO DID NOT LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS COME ON HE CRIED WE CANT HAVE A NAP YET WE MUST GET CLEAR OF THE FOREST FIRST BUT THE OTHERS WERE TOO FAR GONE TO CARE BESIDE THEM SAM STOOD YAWNING AND BLINKING STUPIDLY
SUDDENLY FRODO HIMSELF FELT SLEEP OVERWHELMING HIM HIS HEAD SWAM THERE NOW SEEMED HARDLY A SOUND IN THE AIR THE FLIES HAD STOPPED BUZZING ONLY A GENTLE NOISE ON THE EDGE OF HEARING A SOFT FLUTTERING AS OF A SONG HALF WHISPERED SEEMED TO STIR IN THE BOUGHS ABOVE HE LIFTED HIS HEAVY EYES AND SAW LEANING OVER HIM A HUGE WILLOWTREE OLD AND HOARY ENORMOUS IT LOOKED ITS SPRAWLING BRANCHES GOING UP LIKE REACHING ARMS WITH MANY LONGFINGERED HANDS ITS KNOTTED AND TWISTED TRUNK GAPING IN WIDE FISSURES THAT CREAKED FAINTLY AS THE BOUGHS MOVED THE LEAVES FLUTTERING AGAINST THE BRIGHT SKY DAZZLED HIM AND HE TOPPLED OVER LYING WHERE HE FELL UPON THE GRASS
MERRY AND PIPPIN DRAGGED THEMSELVES FORWARD AND LAY DOWN WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE WILLOWTRUNK BEHIND THEM THE GREAT CRACKS GAPED WIDE TO RECEIVE THEM AS THE TREE SWAYED AND CREAKED THEY LOOKED UP AT THE GREY AND YELLOW LEAVES MOVING SOFTLY AGAINST THE LIGHT AND SINGING THEY SHUT THEIR EYES AND THEN IT SEEMED THAT THEY COULD ALMOST HEAR WORDS COOL WORDS SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT WATER AND SLEEP THEY GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO THE SPELL AND FELL FAST ASLEEP AT THE FOOT OF THE GREAT GREY WILLOW
FRODO LAY FOR A WHILE FIGHTING WITH THE SLEEP THAT WAS OVERPOWERING HIM THEN WITH AN EFFORT HE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEEL AGAIN HE FELT A COMPELLING DESIRE FOR COOL WATER WAIT FOR ME SAM HE STAMMERED MUST BATHE FEET A MINUTE
HALF IN A DREAM HE WANDERED FORWARD TO THE RIVERWARD SIDE OF THE TREE WHERE GREAT WINDING ROOTS GREW OUT INTO THE STREAM LIKE GNARLED DRAGONETS STRAINING DOWN TO DRINK HE STRADDLED ONE OF THESE AND PADDLED HIS HOT FEET IN THE COOL BROWN WATER AND THERE HE TOO SUDDENLY FELL ASLEEP WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE TREE
SAM SAT DOWN AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND YAWNED LIKE A CAVERN HE WAS WORRIED THE AFTERNOON WAS GETTING LATE AND HE THOUGHT THIS SUDDEN SLEEPINESS UNCANNY THERES MORE BEHIND THIS THAN SUN AND WARM AIR HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF I DONT LIKE THIS GREAT BIG TREE I DONT TRUST IT HARK AT IT SINGING ABOUT SLEEP NOW THIS WONT DO AT ALL
HE PULLED HIMSELF TO HIS FEET AND STAGGERED OFF TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE PONIES HE FOUND THAT TWO HAD WANDERED ON A GOOD WAY ALONG THE PATH AND HE HAD JUST CAUGHT THEM AND BROUGHT THEM BACK TOWARDS THE OTHERS WHEN HE HEARD TWO NOISES ONE LOUD AND THE OTHER SOFT BUT VERY CLEAR ONE WAS THE SPLASH OF SOMETHING HEAVY FALLING INTO THE WATER THE OTHER WAS A NOISE LIKE THE SNICK OF A LOCK WHEN A DOOR QUIETLY CLOSES FAST
HE RUSHED BACK TO THE BANK FRODO WAS IN THE WATER CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND A GREAT TREEROOT SEEMED TO BE OVER HIM AND HOLDING HIM DOWN BUT HE WAS NOT STRUGGLING SAM GRIPPED HIM BY THE JACKET AND DRAGGED HIM FROM UNDER THE ROOT AND THEN WITH DIFFICULTY HAULED HIM ON TO THE BANK ALMOST AT ONCE HE WOKE AND COUGHED AND SPLUTTERED
DO YOU KNOW SAM HE SAID AT LENGTH THE BEASTLY TREE THREW ME IN I FELT IT THE BIG ROOT JUST TWISTED ROUND AND TIPPED ME IN
YOU WERE DREAMING I EXPECT MR FRODO SAID SAM YOU SHOULDNT SIT IN SUCH A PLACE IF YOU FEEL SLEEPY
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS FRODO ASKED I WONDER WHAT SORT OF DREAMS THEY ARE HAVING
THEY WENT ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE AND THEN SAM UNDERSTOOD THE CLICK THAT HE HAD HEARD PIPPIN HAD VANISHED THE CRACK BY WHICH HE HAD LAID HIMSELF HAD CLOSED TOGETHER SO THAT NOT A CHINK COULD BE SEEN MERRY WAS TRAPPED ANOTHER CRACK HAD CLOSED ABOUT HIS WAIST HIS LEGS LAY OUTSIDE BUT THE REST OF HIM WAS INSIDE A DARK OPENING THE EDGES OF WHICH GRIPPED LIKE A PAIR OF PINCERS
FRODO AND SAM BEAT FIRST UPON THE TREETRUNK WHERE PIPPIN HAD LAIN THEY THEN STRUGGLED FRANTICALLY TO PULL OPEN THE JAWS OF THE CRACK THAT HELD POOR MERRY IT WAS QUITE USELESS
WHAT A FOUL THING TO HAPPEN CRIED FRODO WILDLY WHY DID WE EVER COME INTO THIS DREADFUL FOREST I WISH WE WERE ALL BACK AT CRICKHOLLOW HE KICKED THE TREE WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HEEDLESS OF HIS OWN FEET A HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE SHIVER RAN THROUGH THE STEM AND UP INTO THE BRANCHES THE LEAVES RUSTLED AND WHISPERED BUT WITH A SOUND NOW OF FAINT AND FAROFF LAUGHTER
I SUPPOSE WE HAVENT GOT AN AXE AMONG OUR LUGGAGE MR FRODO ASKED SAM
I BROUGHT A LITTLE HATCHET FOR CHOPPING FIREWOOD SAID FRODO THAT WOULDNT BE MUCH USE
WAIT A MINUTE CRIED SAM STRUCK BY AN IDEA SUGGESTED BY FIREWOOD WE MIGHT DO SOMETHING WITH FIRE
WE MIGHT SAID FRODO DOUBTFULLY WE MIGHT SUCCEED IN ROASTING PIPPIN ALIVE INSIDE
WE MIGHT TRY TO HURT OR FRIGHTEN THIS TREE TO BEGIN WITH SAID SAM FIERCELY IF IT DONT LET THEM GO ILL HAVE IT DOWN IF I HAVE TO GNAW IT HE RAN TO THE PONIES AND BEFORE LONG CAME BACK WITH TWO TINDERBOXES AND A HATCHET
QUICKLY THEY GATHERED DRY GRASS AND LEAVES AND BITS OF BARK AND MADE A PILE OF BROKEN TWIGS AND CHOPPED STICKS THESE THEY HEAPED AGAINST THE TRUNK ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE TREE FROM THE PRISONERS AS SOON AS SAM HAD STRUCK A SPARK INTO THE TINDER IT KINDLED THE DRY GRASS AND A FLURRY OF FLAME AND SMOKE WENT UP THE TWIGS CRACKLED LITTLE FINGERS OF FIRE LICKED AGAINST THE DRY SCORED RIND OF THE ANCIENT TREE AND SCORCHED IT A TREMOR RAN THROUGH THE WHOLE WILLOW THE LEAVES SEEMED TO HISS ABOVE THEIR HEADS WITH A SOUND OF PAIN AND ANGER A LOUD SCREAM CAME FROM MERRY AND FROM FAR INSIDE THE TREE THEY HEARD PIPPIN GIVE A MUFFLED YELL

PUT IT OUT PUT IT OUT BEGGED MERRY THE BRANCHES OF THE WILLOW BEGAN TO SWAY VIOLENTLY THERE WAS A SOUND AS OF A WIND RISING AND SPREADING OUTWARDS TO THE BRANCHES OF ALL THE OTHER TREES ROUND ABOUT AS THOUGH THEY HAD DROPPED A STONE INTO THE QUIET SLUMBER OF THE RIVERVALLEY AND SET UP RIPPLES OF ANGER THAT RAN OUT OVER THE WHOLE FOREST SAM KICKED AT THE LITTLE FIRE AND STAMPED OUT THE SPARKS BUT FRODO WITHOUT ANY CLEAR IDEA OF WHY HE DID SO OR WHAT HE HOPED FOR RAN ALONG THE PATH CRYING HELP HELP HELP IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE COULD HARDLY HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS OWN SHRILL VOICE IT WAS BLOWN AWAY FROM HIM BY THE WILLOWWIND AND DROWNED IN A CLAMOUR OF LEAVES AS SOON AS THE WORDS LEFT HIS MOUTH HE FELT DESPERATE LOST AND WITLESS
SUDDENLY HE SLOPPED THERE WAS AN ANSWER OR SO HE THOUGHT BUT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM BEHIND HIM AWAY DOWN THE PATH FURTHER BACK IN THE FOREST HE TURNED ROUND AND LISTENED AND SOON THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT SOMEONE WAS SINGING A SONG A DEEP GLAD VOICE WAS SINGING CARELESSLY AND HAPPILY BUT IT WAS SINGING NONSENSE

AFTER THAT THE HOBBITS HEARD NO MORE ALMOST AT ONCE THE SUN SEEMED TO SINK INTO THE TREES BEHIND THEM THEY THOUGHT OF THE SLANTING LIGHT OF EVENING GLITTERING ON THE BRANDYWINE RIVER AND THE WINDOWS OF BUCKLEBURY BEGINNING TO GLEAM WITH HUNDREDS OF LIGHTS GREAT SHADOWS FELL ACROSS THEM TRUNKS AND BRANCHES OF TREES HUNG DARK AND THREATENING OVER THE PATH WHITE MISTS BEGAN TO RISE AND CURL ON THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER AND STRAY ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TREES UPON ITS BORDERS OUT OF THE VERY GROUND AT THEIR FEET A SHADOWY STEAM AROSE AND MINGLED WITH THE SWIFTLY FALLING DUSK
IT BECAME DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THE PATH AND THEY WERE VERY TIRED THEIR LEGS SEEMED LEADEN STRANGE FURTIVE NOISES RAN AMONG THE BUSHES AND REEDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM AND IF THEY LOOKED UP TO THE PALE SKY THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF QUEER GNARLED AND KNOBBLY FACES THAT GLOOMED DARK AGAINST THE TWILIGHT AND LEERED DOWN AT THEM FROM THE HIGH BANK AND THE EDGES OF THE WOOD THEY BEGAN TO FEEL THAT ALL THIS COUNTRY WAS UNREAL AND THAT THEY WERE STUMBLING THROUGH AN OMINOUS DREAM THAT LED TO NO AWAKENING
JUST AS THEY FELT THEIR FEET SLOWING DOWN TO A STANDSTILL THEY NOTICED THAT THE GROUND WAS GENTLY RISING THE WATER BEGAN TO MURMUR IN THE DARKNESS THEY CAUGHT THE WHITE GLIMMER OF FOAM WHERE THE RIVER FLOWED OVER A SHORT FALL THEN SUDDENLY THE TREES CAME TO AN END AND THE MISTS WERE LEFT BEHIND THEY STEPPED OUT FROM THE FOREST AND FOUND A WIDE SWEEP OF GRASS WELLING UP BEFORE THEM THE RIVER NOW SMALL AND SWIFT WAS LEAPING MERRILY DOWN TO MEET THEM GLINTING HERE AND THERE IN THE LIGHT OF THE STARS WHICH WERE ALREADY SHINING IN THE SKY
THE GRASS UNDER THEIR FEET WAS SMOOTH AND SHORT AS IF IT HAD BEEN MOWN OR SHAVEN THE EAVES OF THE FOREST BEHIND WERE CLIPPED AND TRIM AS A HEDGE THE PATH WAS NOW PLAIN BEFORE THEM WELLTENDED AND BORDERED WITH STONE IT WOUND UP ON TO THE TOP OF A GRASSY KNOLL NOW GREY UNDER THE PALE STARRY NIGHT AND THERE STILL HIGH ABOVE THEM ON A FURTHER SLOPE THEY SAW THE TWINKLING LIGHTS OF A HOUSE DOWN AGAIN THE PATH WENT AND THEN UP AGAIN UP A LONG SMOOTH HILLSIDE OF TURF TOWARDS THE LIGHT SUDDENLY A WIDE YELLOW BEAM FLOWED OUT BRIGHTLY FROM A DOOR THAT WAS OPENED THERE WAS TOM BOMBADILS HOUSE BEFORE THEM UP DOWN UNDER HILL BEHIND IT A STEEP SHOULDER OF THE LAND LAY GREY AND BARE AND BEYOND THAT THE DARK SHAPES OF THE BARROWDOWNS STALKED AWAY INTO THE EASTERN NIGHT

AND WITH THAT SONG THE HOBBITS STOOD UPON THE THRESHOLD AND A GOLDEN LIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT THEM



CHAPTER 7
IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL

TOM SAT ON A WHILE BESIDE THEM IN SILENCE WHILE EACH OF THEM TRIED TO MUSTER THE COURAGE TO ASK ONE OF THE MANY QUESTIONS HE HAD MEANT TO ASK AT SUPPER SLEEP GATHERED ON THEIR EYELIDS AT LAST FRODO SPOKE
DID YOU HEAR ME CALLING MASTER OR WAS IT JUST CHANCE THAT BROUGHT YOU AT THAT MOMENT

BY THAT POOL LONG AGO I FOUND THE RIVERDAUGHTER

HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT THEM WITH A SUDDEN GLINT OF BLUE
AND THAT PROVED WELL FOR YOU  FOR NOW I SHALL NO LONGER
GO DOWN DEEP AGAIN ALONG THE FORESTWATER
NOT WHILE THE YEAR IS OLD NOR SHALL I BE PASSING
OLD MAN WILLOWS HOUSE THIS SIDE OF SPRINGTIME

THEIR MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS WERE SOFT AS DOWN AND THE BLANKETS WERE OF WHITE WOOL THEY HAD HARDLY LAID THEMSELVES ON THE DEEP BEDS AND DRAWN THE LIGHT COVERS OVER THEM BEFORE THEY WERE ASLEEP

AS THEY LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW THERE CAME FALLING GENTLY AS IF IT WAS FLOWING DOWN THE RAIN OUT OF THE SKY THE CLEAR VOICE OF GOLDBERRY SINGING UP ABOVE THEM THEY COULD HEAR FEW WORDS BUT IT SEEMED PLAIN TO THEM THAT THE SONG WAS A RAINSONG AS SWEET AS SHOWERS ON DRY HILLS THAT TOLD THE TALE OF A RIVER FROM THE SPRING IN THE HIGHLANDS TO THE SEA FAR BELOW THE HOBBITS LISTENED WITH DELIGHT AND FRODO WAS GLAD IN HIS HEART AND BLESSED THE KINDLY WEATHER BECAUSE IT DELAYED THEM FROM DEPARTING THE THOUGHT OF GOING HAD BEEN HEAVY UPON HIM FROM THE MOMENT HE AWOKE BUT HE GUESSED NOW THAT THEY WOULD NOT GO FURTHER THAT DAY
THE UPPER WIND SETTLED IN THE WEST AND DEEPER AND WETTER CLOUDS ROLLED UP TO SPILL THEIR LADEN RAIN ON THE BARE HEADS OF THE DOWNS NOTHING COULD BE SEEN ALL ROUND THE HOUSE BUT FALLING WATER FRODO STOOD NEAR THE OPEN DOOR AND WATCHED THE WHITE CHALKY PATH TURN INTO A LITTLE RIVER OF MILK AND GO BUBBLING AWAY DOWN INTO THE VALLEY TOM BOMBADIL CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WAVING HIS ARMS AS IF HE WAS WARDING OFF THE RAIN  AND INDEED WHEN HE SPRANG OVER THE THRESHOLD HE SEEMED QUITE DRY EXCEPT FOR HIS BOOTS THESE HE TOOK OFF AND PUT IN THE CHIMNEYCORNER THEN HE SAT IN THE LARGEST CHAIR AND CALLED THE HOBBITS TO GATHER ROUND HIM
THIS IS GOLDBERRYS WASHING DAY HE SAID AND HER AUTUMNCLEANING TOO WET FOR HOBBITFOLK  LET THEM REST WHILE THEY ARE ABLE ITS A GOOD DAY FOR LONG TALES FOR QUESTIONS AND FOR ANSWERS SO TOM WILL START THE TALKING
HE THEN TOLD THEM MANY REMARKABLE STORIES SOMETIMES HALF AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF SOMETIMES LOOKING AT THEM SUDDENLY WITH A BRIGHT BLUE EYE UNDER HIS DEEP BROWS OFTEN HIS VOICE WOULD TURN TO SONG AND HE WOULD GET OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND DANCE ABOUT HE TOLD THEM TALES OF BEES AND FLOWERS THE WAYS OF TREES AND THE STRANGE CREATURES OF THE FOREST ABOUT THE EVIL THINGS AND GOOD THINGS THINGS FRIENDLY AND THINGS UNFRIENDLY CRUEL THINGS AND KIND THINGS AND SECRETS HIDDEN UNDER BRAMBLES
AS THEY LISTENED THEY BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE LIVES OF THE FOREST APART FROM THEMSELVES INDEED TO FEEL THEMSELVES AS THE STRANGERS WHERE ALL OTHER THINGS WERE AT HOME MOVING CONSTANTLY IN AND OUT OF HIS TALK WAS OLD MAN WILLOW AND FRODO LEARNED NOW ENOUGH TO CONTENT HIM INDEED MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR IT WAS NOT COMFORTABLE LORE TOMS WORDS LAID BARE THE HEARTS OF TREES AND THEIR THOUGHTS WHICH WERE OFTEN DARK AND STRANGE AND FILLED WITH A HATRED OF THINGS THAT GO FREE UPON THE EARTH GNAWING BITING BREAKING HACKING BURNING DESTROYERS AND USURPERS IT WAS NOT CALLED THE OLD FOREST WITHOUT REASON FOR IT WAS INDEED ANCIENT A SURVIVOR OF VAST FORGOTTEN WOODS AND IN IT THERE LIVED YET AGEING NO QUICKER THAN THE HILLS THE FATHERS OF THE FATHERS OF TREES REMEMBERING TIMES WHEN THEY WERE LORDS THE COUNTLESS YEARS HAD FILLED THEM WITH PRIDE AND ROOTED WISDOM AND WITH MALICE BUT NONE WERE MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE GREAT WILLOW HIS HEART WAS ROTTEN BUT HIS STRENGTH WAS GREEN AND HE WAS CUNNING AND A MASTER OF WINDS AND HIS SONG AND THOUGHT RAN THROUGH THE WOODS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER HIS GREY THIRSTY SPIRIT DREW POWER OUT OF THE EARTH AND SPREAD LIKE FINE ROOTTHREADS IN THE GROUND AND INVISIBLE TWIGFINGERS IN THE AIR TILL IT HAD UNDER ITS DOMINION NEARLY ALL THE TREES OF THE FOREST FROM THE HEDGE TO THE DOWNS
SUDDENLY TOMS TALK LEFT THE WOODS AND WENT LEAPING UP THE YOUNG STREAM OVER BUBBLING WATERFALLS OVER PEBBLES AND WORN ROCKS AND AMONG SMALL FLOWERS IN CLOSE GRASS AND WET CRANNIES WANDERING AT LAST UP ON TO THE DOWNS THEY HEARD OF THE GREAT BARROWS AND THE GREEN MOUNDS AND THE STONERINGS UPON THE HILLS AND IN THE HOLLOWS AMONG THE HILLS SHEEP WERE BLEATING IN FLOCKS GREEN WALLS AND WHITE WALLS ROSE THERE WERE FORTRESSES ON THE HEIGHTS KINGS OF LITTLE KINGDOMS FOUGHT TOGETHER AND THE YOUNG SUN SHONE LIKE FIRE ON THE RED METAL OF THEIR NEW AND GREEDY SWORDS THERE WAS VICTORY AND DEFEAT AND TOWERS FELL FORTRESSES WERE BURNED AND FLAMES WENT UP INTO THE SKY GOLD WAS PILED ON THE BIERS OF DEAD KINGS AND QUEENS AND MOUNDS COVERED THEM AND THE STONE DOORS WERE SHUT AND THE GRASS GREW OVER ALL SHEEP WALKED FOR A WHILE BITING THE GRASS BUT SOON THE HILLS WERE EMPTY AGAIN A SHADOW CAME OUT OF DARK PLACES FAR AWAY AND THE BONES WERE STIRRED IN THE MOUNDS BARROWWIGHTS WALKED IN THE HOLLOW PLACES WITH A CLINK OF RINGS ON COLD FINGERS AND GOLD CHAINS IN THE WIND STONE RINGS GRINNED OUT OF THE GROUND LIKE BROKEN TEETH IN THE MOONLIGHT
THE HOBBITS SHUDDERED EVEN IN THE SHIRE THE RUMOUR OF THE BARROWWIGHTS OF THE BARROWDOWNS BEYOND THE FOREST HAD BEEN HEARD BUT IT WAS NOT A TALE THAT ANY HOBBIT LIKED TO LISTEN TO EVEN BY A COMFORTABLE FIRESIDE FAR AWAY THESE FOUR NOW SUDDENLY REMEMBERED WHAT THE JOY OF THIS HOUSE HAD DRIVEN FROM THEIR MINDS THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL NESTLED UNDER THE VERY SHOULDER OF THOSE DREADED HILLS THEY LOST THE THREAD OF HIS TALE AND SHIFTED UNEASILY LOOKING ASIDE AT ONE ANOTHER
WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIS WORDS AGAIN THEY FOUND THAT HE HAD NOW WANDERED INTO STRANGE REGIONS BEYOND THEIR MEMORY AND BEYOND THEIR WAKING THOUGHT INTO TIMES WHEN THE WORLD WAS WIDER AND THE SEAS FLOWED STRAIGHT TO THE WESTERN SHORE AND STILL ON AND BACK TOM WENT SINGING OUT INTO ANCIENT STARLIGHT WHEN ONLY THE ELFSIRES WERE AWAKE THEN SUDDENLY HE STOPPED AND THEY SAW THAT HE NODDED AS IF HE WAS FALLING ASLEEP THE HOBBITS SAT STILL BEFORE HIM ENCHANTED AND IT SEEMED AS IF UNDER THE SPELL OF HIS WORDS THE WIND HAD GONE AND THE CLOUDS HAD DRIED UP AND THE DAY HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN AND DARKNESS HAD COME FROM EAST AND WEST AND ALL THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH THE LIGHT OF WHITE STARS
WHETHER THE MORNING AND EVENING OF ONE DAY OR OF MANY DAYS HAD PASSED FRODO COULD NOT TELL HE DID NOT FEEL EITHER HUNGRY OR TIRED ONLY FILLED WITH WONDER THE STARS SHONE THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THE SILENCE OF THE HEAVENS SEEMED TO BE ROUND HIM HE SPOKE AT LAST OUT OF HIS WONDER AND A SUDDEN FEAR OF THAT SILENCE
WHO ARE YOU MASTER HE ASKED
EH WHAT SAID TOM SITTING UP AND HIS EYES GLINTING IN THE GLOOM DONT YOU KNOW MY NAME YET THATS THE ONLY ANSWER TELL ME WHO ARE YOU ALONE YOURSELF AND NAMELESS BUT YOU ARE YOUNG AND I AM OLD ELDEST THATS WHAT I AM MARK MY WORDS MY FRIENDS TOM WAS HERE BEFORE THE RIVER AND THE TREES TOM REMEMBERS THE FIRST RAINDROP AND THE FIRST ACORN HE MADE PATHS BEFORE THE BIG PEOPLE AND SAW THE LITTLE PEOPLE ARRIVING HE WAS HERE BEFORE THE KINGS AND THE GRAVES AND THE BARROWWIGHTS WHEN THE ELVES PASSED WESTWARD TOM WAS HERE ALREADY BEFORE THE SEAS WERE BENT HE KNEW THE DARK UNDER THE STARS WHEN IT WAS FEARLESS  BEFORE THE DARK LORD CAME FROM OUTSIDE
A SHADOW SEEMED TO PASS BY THE WINDOW AND THE HOBBITS GLANCED HASTILY THROUGH THE PANES WHEN THEY TURNED AGAIN GOLDBERRY STOOD IN THE DOOR BEHIND FRAMED IN LIGHT SHE HELD A CANDLE SHIELDING ITS FLAME FROM THE DRAUGHT WITH HER HAND AND THE LIGHT FLOWED THROUGH IT LIKE SUNLIGHT THROUGH A WHITE SHELL
THE RAIN HAS ENDED SHE SAID AND NEW WATERS ARE RUNNING DOWNHILL UNDER THE STARS LET US NOW LAUGH AND BE GLAD
AND LET US HAVE FOOD AND DRINK CRIED TOM LONG TALES ARE THIRSTY AND LONG LISTENINGS HUNGRY WORK MORNING NOON AND EVENING WITH THAT HE JUMPED OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND WITH A BOUND TOOK A CANDLE FROM THE CHIMNEYSHELF AND LIT IT IN THE FLAME THAT GOLDBERRY HELD THEN HE DANCED ABOUT THE TABLE SUDDENLY HE HOPPED THROUGH THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED
QUICKLY HE RETURNED BEARING A LARGE AND LADEN TRAY THEN TOM AND GOLDBERRY SET THE TABLE AND THE HOBBITS SAT HALF IN WONDER AND HALF IN LAUGHTER SO FAIR WAS THE GRACE OF GOLDBERRY AND SO MERRY AND ODD THE CAPERINGS OF TOM YET IN SOME FASHION THEY SEEMED TO WEAVE A SINGLE DANCE NEITHER HINDERING THE OTHER IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND ABOUT THE TABLE AND WITH GREAT SPEED FOOD AND VESSELS AND LIGHTS WERE SET IN ORDER THE BOARDS BLAZED WITH CANDLES WHITE AND YELLOW TOM BOWED TO HIS GUESTS SUPPER IS READY SAID GOLDBERRY AND NOW THE HOBBITS SAW THAT SHE WAS CLOTHED ALL IN SILVER WITH A WHITE GIRDLE AND HER SHOES WERE LIKE FISHES MAIL BUT TOM WAS ALL IN CLEAN BLUE BLUE AS RAINWASHED FORGETMENOTS AND HE HAD GREEN STOCKINGS
IT WAS A SUPPER EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE THE HOBBITS UNDER THE SPELL OF TOMS WORDS MAY HAVE MISSED ONE MEAL OR MANY BUT WHEN THE FOOD WAS BEFORE THEM IT SEEMED AT LEAST A WEEK SINCE THEY HAD EATEN THEY DID NOT SING OR EVEN SPEAK MUCH FOR A WHILE AND PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO BUSINESS BUT AFTER A TIME THEIR HEARTS AND SPIRIT ROSE HIGH AGAIN AND THEIR VOICES RANG OUT IN MIRTH AND LAUGHTER
AFTER THEY HAD EATEN GOLDBERRY SANG MANY SONGS FOR THEM SONGS THAT BEGAN MERRILY IN THE HILLS AND FELL SOFTLY DOWN INTO SILENCE AND IN THE SILENCES THEY SAW IN THEIR MINDS POOLS AND WATERS WIDER THAN ANY THEY HAD KNOWN AND LOOKING INTO THEM THEY SAW THE SKY BELOW THEM AND THE STARS LIKE JEWELS IN THE DEPTHS THEN ONCE MORE SHE WISHED THEM EACH GOOD NIGHT AND LEFT THEM BY THE FIRESIDE BUT TOM NOW SEEMED WIDE AWAKE AND PLIED THEM WITH QUESTIONS
HE APPEARED ALREADY TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM AND ALL THEIR FAMILIES AND INDEED TO KNOW MUCH OF ALL THE HISTORY AND DOINGS OF THE SHIRE DOWN FROM DAYS HARDLY REMEMBERED AMONG THE HOBBITS THEMSELVES IT NO LONGER SURPRISED THEM BUT HE MADE NO SECRET THAT HE OWED HIS RECENT KNOWLEDGE LARGELY TO FARMER MAGGOT WHOM HE SEEMED TO REGARD AS A PERSON OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THEY HAD IMAGINED THERES EARTH UNDER HIS OLD FEET AND CLAY ON HIS FINGERS WISDOM IN HIS BONES AND BOTH HIS EYES ARE OPEN SAID TOM IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT TOM HAD DEALINGS WITH THE ELVES AND IT SEEMED THAT IN SOME FASHION NEWS HAD REACHED HIM FROM GILDOR CONCERNING THE FLIGHT OF FRODO
INDEED SO MUCH DID TOM KNOW AND SO CUNNING WAS HIS QUESTIONING THAT FRODO FOUND HIMSELF TELLING HIM MORE ABOUT BILBO AND HIS OWN HOPES AND FEARS THAN HE HAD TOLD BEFORE EVEN TO GANDALF TOM WAGGED HIS HEAD UP AND DOWN AND THERE WAS A GLINT IN HIS EYES WHEN HE HEARD OF THE RIDERS
SHOW ME THE PRECIOUS RING HE SAID SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THE STORY AND FRODO TO HIS OWN ASTONISHMENT DREW OUT THE CHAIN FROM HIS POCKET AND UNFASTENING THE RING HANDED IT AT ONCE TO TOM
IT SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AS IT LAY FOR A MOMENT ON HIS BIG BROWNSKINNED HAND THEN SUDDENLY HE PUT IT TO HIS EYE AND LAUGHED FOR A SECOND THE HOBBITS HAD A VISION BOTH COMICAL AND ALARMING OF HIS BRIGHT BLUE EYE GLEAMING THROUGH A CIRCLE OF GOLD THEN TOM PUT THE RING ROUND THE END OF HIS LITTLE FINGER AND HELD IT UP TO THE CANDLELIGHT FOR A MOMENT THE HOBBITS NOTICED NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS THEN THEY GASPED THERE WAS NO SIGN OF TOM DISAPPEARING
TOM LAUGHED AGAIN AND THEN HE SPUN THE RING IN THE AIR  AND IT VANISHED WITH A FLASH FRODO GAVE A CRY  AND TOM LEANED FORWARD AND HANDED IT BACK TO HIM WITH A SMILE
FRODO LOOKED AT IT CLOSELY AND RATHER SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE ONE WHO HAS LENT A TRINKET TO A JUGGLER IT WAS THE SAME RING OR LOOKED THE SAME AND WEIGHED THE SAME FOR THAT RING HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO FRODO TO WEIGH STRANGELY HEAVY IN THE HAND BUT SOMETHING PROMPTED HIM TO MAKE SURE HE WAS PERHAPS A TRIFLE ANNOYED WITH TOM FOR SEEMING TO MAKE SO LIGHT OF WHAT EVEN GANDALF THOUGHT SO PERILOUSLY IMPORTANT HE WAITED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN THE TALK WAS GOING AGAIN AND TOM WAS TELLING AN ABSURD STORY ABOUT BADGERS AND THEIR QUEER WAYS  THEN HE SLIPPED THE RING ON
MERRY TURNED TOWARDS HIM TO SAY SOMETHING AND GAVE A START AND CHECKED AN EXCLAMATION FRODO WAS DELIGHTED IN A WAY IT WAS HIS OWN RING ALL RIGHT FOR MERRY WAS STARING BLANKLY AT HIS CHAIR AND OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT SEE HIM HE GOT UP AND CREPT QUIETLY AWAY FROM THE FIRESIDE TOWARDS THE OUTER DOOR
HEY THERE CRIED TOM GLANCING TOWARDS HIM WITH A MOST SEEING LOOK IN HIS SHINING EYES HEY COME FRODO THERE WHERE BE YOU AGOING OLD TOM BOMBADILS NOT AS BLIND AS THAT YET TAKE OFF YOUR GOLDEN RING YOUR HANDS MORE FAIR WITHOUT IT COME BACK LEAVE YOUR GAME AND SIT DOWN BESIDE ME WE MUST TALK A WHILE MORE AND THINK ABOUT THE MORNING TOM MUST TEACH THE RIGHT ROAD AND KEEP YOUR FEET FROM WANDERING
FRODO LAUGHED TRYING TO FEEL PLEASED AND TAKING OFF THE RING HE CAME AND SAT DOWN AGAIN TOM NOW TOLD THEM THAT HE RECKONED THE SUN WOULD SHINE TOMORROW AND IT WOULD BE A GLAD MORNING AND SETTING OUT WOULD BE HOPEFUL BUT THEY WOULD DO WELL TO START EARLY FOR WEATHER IN THAT COUNTRY WAS A THING THAT EVEN TOM COULD NOT BE SURE OF FOR LONG AND IT WOULD CHANGE SOMETIMES QUICKER THAN HE COULD CHANGE HIS JACKET I AM NO WEATHERMASTER HE SAID NOR IS AUGHT THAT GOES ON TWO LEGS
BY HIS ADVICE THEY DECIDED TO MAKE NEARLY DUE NORTH FROM HIS HOUSE OVER THE WESTERN AND LOWER SLOPES OF THE DOWNS THEY MIGHT HOPE IN THAT WAY TO STRIKE THE EAST ROAD IN A DAYS JOURNEY AND AVOID THE BARROWS HE TOLD THEM NOT TO BE AFRAID  BUT TO MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS
KEEP TO THE GREEN GRASS DONT YOU GO AMEDDLING WITH OLD STONE OR COLD WIGHTS OR PRYING IN THEIR HOUSES UNLESS YOU BE STRONG FOLK WITH HEARTS THAT NEVER FALTER HE SAID THIS MORE THAN ONCE AND HE ADVISED THEM TO PASS BARROWS BY ON THE WESTSIDE IF THEY CHANCED TO STRAY NEAR ONE THEN HE TAUGHT THEM A RHYME TO SING IF THEY SHOULD BY ILLLUCK FALL INTO ANY DANGER OR DIFFICULTY THE NEXT DAY
HO TOM BOMBADIL TOM BOMBADILLO
BY WATER WOOD AND HILL BY THE REED AND WILLOW
BY FIRE SUN AND MOON HARKEN NOW AND HEAR US
COME TOM BOMBADIL FOR OUR NEED IS NEAR US

WHEN THEY HAD SUNG THIS ALTOGETHER AFTER HIM HE CLAPPED THEM EACH ON THE SHOULDER WITH A LAUGH AND TAKING CANDLES LED THEM BACK TO THEIR BEDROOM



CHAPTER 8
FOG ON THE BARROWDOWNS

THAT NIGHT THEY HEARD NO NOISES BUT EITHER IN HIS DREAMS OR OUT OF THEM HE COULD NOT TELL WHICH FRODO HEARD A SWEET SINGING RUNNING IN HIS MIND A SONG THAT SEEMED TO COME LIKE A PALE LIGHT BEHIND A GREY RAINCURTAIN AND GROWING STRONGER TO TURN THE VEIL ALL TO GLASS AND SILVER UNTIL AT LAST IT WAS ROLLED BACK AND A FAR GREEN COUNTRY OPENED BEFORE HIM UNDER A SWIFT SUNRISE
THE VISION MELTED INTO WAKING AND THERE WAS TOM WHISTLING LIKE A TREEFULL OF BIRDS AND THE SUN WAS ALREADY SLANTING DOWN THE HILL AND THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW OUTSIDE EVERYTHING WAS GREEN AND PALE GOLD
AFTER BREAKFAST WHICH THEY AGAIN ATE ALONE THEY MADE READY TO SAY FAREWELL AS NEARLY HEAVY OF HEART AS WAS POSSIBLE ON SUCH A MORNING COOL BRIGHT AND CLEAN UNDER A WASHED AUTUMN SKY OF THIN BLUE THE AIR CAME FRESH FROM THE NORTHWEST THEIR QUIET PONIES WERE ALMOST FRISKY SNIFFING AND MOVING RESTLESSLY TOM CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND WAVED HIS HAT AND DANCED UPON THE DOORSTEP BIDDING THE HOBBITS TO GET UP AND BE OFF AND GO WITH GOOD SPEED
THEY RODE OFF ALONG A PATH THAT WOUND AWAY FROM BEHIND THE HOUSE AND WENT SLANTING UP TOWARDS THE NORTH END OF THE HILLBROW UNDER WHICH IT SHELTERED THEY HAD JUST DISMOUNTED TO LEAD THEIR PONIES UP THE LAST STEEP SLOPE WHEN SUDDENLY FRODO STOPPED
GOLDBERRY HE CRIED MY FAIR LADY CLAD ALL IN SILVER GREEN WE HAVE NEVER SAID FAREWELL TO HER NOR SEEN HER SINCE THE EVENING HE WAS SO DISTRESSED THAT HE TURNED BACK BUT AT THAT MOMENT A CLEAR CALL CAME RIPPLING DOWN THERE ON THE HILLBROW SHE STOOD BECKONING TO THEM HER HAIR WAS FLYING LOOSE AND AS IT CAUGHT THE SUN IT SHONE AND SHIMMERED A LIGHT LIKE THE GLINT OF WATER ON DEWY GRASS FLASHED FROM UNDER HER FEET AS SHE DANCED
THEY HASTENED UP THE LAST SLOPE AND STOOD BREATHLESS BESIDE HER THEY BOWED BUT WITH A WAVE OF HER ARM SHE BADE THEM LOOK ROUND AND THEY LOOKED OUT FROM THE HILLTOP OVER LANDS UNDER THE MORNING IT WAS NOW AS CLEAR AND FARSEEN AS IT HAD BEEN VEILED AND MISTY WHEN THEY STOOD UPON THE KNOLL IN THE FOREST WHICH COULD NOW BE SEEN RISING PALE AND GREEN OUT OF THE DARK TREES IN THE WEST IN THAT DIRECTION THE LAND ROSE IN WOODED RIDGES GREEN YELLOW RUSSET UNDER THE SUN BEYOND WHICH LAY HIDDEN THE VALLEY OF THE BRANDYWINE TO THE SOUTH OVER THE LINE OF THE WITHYWINDLE THERE WAS A DISTANT GLINT LIKE PALE GLASS WHERE THE BRANDYWINE RIVER MADE A GREAT LOOP IN THE LOWLANDS AND FLOWED AWAY OUT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOBBITS NORTHWARD BEYOND THE DWINDLING DOWNS THE LAND RAN AWAY IN FLATS AND SWELLINGS OF GREY AND GREEN AND PALE EARTHCOLOURS UNTIL IT FADED INTO A FEATURELESS AND SHADOWY DISTANCE EASTWARD THE BARROWDOWNS ROSE RIDGE BEHIND RIDGE INTO THE MORNING AND VANISHED OUT OF EYESIGHT INTO A GUESS IT WAS NO MORE THAN A GUESS OF BLUE AND A REMOTE WHITE GLIMMER BLENDING WITH THE HEM OF THE SKY BUT IT SPOKE TO THEM OUT OF MEMORY AND OLD TALES OF THE HIGH AND DISTANT MOUNTAINS
THEY TOOK A DEEP DRAUGHT OF THE AIR AND FELT THAT A SKIP AND A FEW STOUT STRIDES WOULD BEAR THEM WHEREVER THEY WISHED IT SEEMED FAINTHEARTED TO GO JOGGING ASIDE OVER THE CRUMPLED SKIRTS OF THE DOWNS TOWARDS THE ROAD WHEN THEY SHOULD BE LEAPING AS LUSTY AS TOM OVER THE STEPPING STONES OF THE HILLS STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS
GOLDBERRY SPOKE TO THEM AND RECALLED THEIR EYES AND THOUGHTS SPEED NOW FAIR GUESTS SHE SAID AND HOLD TO YOUR PURPOSE NORTH WITH THE WIND IN THE LEFT EYE AND A BLESSING ON YOUR FOOTSTEPS MAKE HASTE WHILE THE SUN SHINES AND TO FRODO SHE SAID FAREWELL ELFFRIEND IT WAS A MERRY MEETING
BUT FRODO FOUND NO WORDS TO ANSWER HE BOWED LOW AND MOUNTED HIS PONY AND FOLLOWED BY HIS FRIENDS JOGGED SLOWLY DOWN THE GENTLE SLOPE BEHIND THE HILL TOM BOMBADILS HOUSE AND THE VALLEY AND THE FOREST WERE LOST TO VIEW THE AIR GREW WARMER BETWEEN THE GREEN WALLS OF HILLSIDE AND HILLSIDE AND THE SCENT OF TURF ROSE STRONG AND SWEET AS THEY BREATHED TURNING BACK WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE GREEN HOLLOW THEY SAW GOLDBERRY NOW SMALL AND SLENDER LIKE A SUNLIT FLOWER AGAINST THE SKY SHE WAS STANDING STILL WATCHING THEM AND HER HANDS WERE STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS THEM AS THEY LOOKED SHE GAVE A CLEAR CALL AND LIFTING UP HER HAND SHE TURNED AND VANISHED BEHIND THE HILL
THEIR WAY WOUND ALONG THE FLOOR OF THE HOLLOW AND ROUND THE GREEN FEET OF A STEEP HILL INTO ANOTHER DEEPER AND BROADER VALLEY AND THEN OVER THE SHOULDER OF FURTHER HILLS AND DOWN THEIR LONG LIMBS AND UP THEIR SMOOTH SIDES AGAIN UP ON TO NEW HILLTOPS AND DOWN INTO NEW VALLEYS THERE WAS NO TREE NOR ANY VISIBLE WATER IT WAS A COUNTRY OF GRASS AND SHORT SPRINGY TURF SILENT EXCEPT FOR THE WHISPER OF THE AIR OVER THE EDGES OF THE LAND AND HIGH LONELY CRIES OF STRANGE BIRDS AS THEY JOURNEYED THE SUN MOUNTED AND GREW HOT EACH TIME THEY CLIMBED A RIDGE THE BREEZE SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN LESS WHEN THEY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE COUNTRY WESTWARD THE DISTANT FOREST SEEMED TO BE SMOKING AS IF THE FALLEN RAIN WAS STEAMING UP AGAIN FROM LEAF AND ROOT AND MOULD A SHADOW NOW LAY ROUND THE EDGE OF SIGHT A DARK HAZE ABOVE WHICH THE UPPER SKY WAS LIKE A BLUE CAP HOT AND HEAVY
ABOUT MIDDAY THEY CAME TO A HILL WHOSE TOP WAS WIDE AND FLATTENED LIKE A SHALLOW SAUCER WITH A GREEN MOUNDED RIM INSIDE THERE WAS NO AIR STIRRING AND THE SKY SEEMED NEAR THEIR HEADS THEY RODE ACROSS AND LOOKED NORTHWARDS THEN THEIR HEARTS ROSE FOR IT SEEMED PLAIN THAT THEY HAD COME FURTHER ALREADY THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED CERTAINLY THE DISTANCES HAD NOW ALL BECOME HAZY AND DECEPTIVE BUT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT THE DOWNS WERE COMING TO AN END A LONG VALLEY LAY BELOW THEM WINDING AWAY NORTHWARDS UNTIL IT CAME TO AN OPENING BETWEEN TWO STEEP SHOULDERS BEYOND THERE SEEMED TO BE NO MORE HILLS DUE NORTH THEY FAINTLY GLIMPSED A LONG DARK LINE THAT IS A LINE OF TREES SAID MERRY AND THAT MUST MARK THE ROAD ALL ALONG IT FOR MANY LEAGUES EAST OF THE BRIDGE THERE ARE TREES GROWING SOME SAY THEY WERE PLANTED IN THE OLD DAYS
SPLENDID SAID FRODO IF WE MAKE AS GOOD GOING THIS AFTERNOON AS WE HAVE DONE THIS MORNING WE SHALL HAVE LEFT THE DOWNS BEFORE THE SUN SETS AND BE JOGGING ON IN SEARCH OF A CAMPING PLACE BUT EVEN AS HE SPOKE HE TURNED HIS GLANCE EASTWARDS AND HE SAW THAT ON THAT SIDE THE HILLS WERE HIGHER AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THEM AND ALL THOSE HILLS WERE CROWNED WITH GREEN MOUNDS AND ON SOME WERE STANDING STONES POINTING UPWARDS LIKE JAGGED TEETH OUT OF GREEN GUMS
THAT VIEW WAS SOMEHOW DISQUIETING SO THEY TURNED FROM THE SIGHT AND WENT DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW CIRCLE IN THE MIDST OF IT THERE STOOD A SINGLE STONE STANDING TALL UNDER THE SUN ABOVE AND AT THIS HOUR CASTING NO SHADOW IT WAS SHAPELESS AND YET SIGNIFICANT LIKE A LANDMARK OR A GUARDING FINGER OR MORE LIKE A WARNING BUT THEY WERE NOW HUNGRY AND THE SUN WAS STILL AT THE FEARLESS NOON SO THEY SET THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE EAST SIDE OF THE STONE IT WAS COOL AS IF THE SUN HAD HAD NO POWER TO WARM IT BUT AT THAT TIME THIS SEEMED PLEASANT THERE THEY TOOK FOOD AND DRINK AND MADE AS GOOD A NOONMEAL UNDER THE OPEN SKY AS ANYONE COULD WISH FOR THE FOOD CAME FROM DOWN UNDER HILL TOM HAD PROVIDED THEM WITH PLENTY FOR THE COMFORT OF THE DAY THEIR PONIES UNBURDENED STRAYED UPON THE GRASS
RIDING OVER THE HILLS AND EATING THEIR FILL THE WARM SUN AND THE SCENT OF TURF LYING A LITTLE TOO LONG STRETCHING OUT THEIR LEGS AND LOOKING AT THE SKY ABOVE THEIR NOSES THESE THINGS ARE PERHAPS ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THEY WOKE SUDDENLY AND UNCOMFORTABLY FROM A SLEEP THEY HAD NEVER MEANT TO TAKE THE STANDING STONE WAS COLD AND IT CAST A LONG PALE SHADOW THAT STRETCHED EASTWARD OVER THEM THE SUN A PALE AND WATERY YELLOW WAS GLEAMING THROUGH THE MIST JUST ABOVE THE WEST WALL OF THE HOLLOW IN WHICH THEY LAY NORTH SOUTH AND EAST BEYOND THE WALL THE FOG WAS THICK COLD AND WHITE THE AIR WAS SILENT HEAVY AND CHILL THEIR PONIES WERE STANDING CROWDED TOGETHER WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN
THE HOBBITS SPRANG TO THEIR FEET IN ALARM AND RAN TO THE WESTERN RIM THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE UPON AN ISLAND IN THE FOG EVEN AS THEY LOOKED OUT IN DISMAY TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN IT SANK BEFORE THEIR EYES INTO A WHITE SEA AND A COLD GREY SHADOW SPRANG UP IN THE EAST BEHIND THE FOG ROLLED UP TO THE WALLS AND ROSE ABOVE THEM AND AS IT MOUNTED IT BENT OVER THEIR HEADS UNTIL IT BECAME A ROOF THEY WERE SHUT IN A HALL OF MIST WHOSE CENTRAL PILLAR WAS THE STANDING STONE
THEY FELT AS IF A TRAP WAS CLOSING ABOUT THEM BUT THEY DID NOT QUITE LOSE HEART THEY STILL REMEMBERED THE HOPEFUL VIEW THEY HAD HAD OF THE LINE OF THE ROAD AHEAD AND THEY STILL KNEW IN WHICH DIRECTION IT LAY IN ANY CASE THEY NOW HAD SO GREAT A DISLIKE FOR THAT HOLLOW PLACE ABOUT THE STONE THAT NO THOUGHT OF REMAINING THERE WAS IN THEIR MINDS THEY PACKED UP AS QUICKLY AS THEIR CHILLED FINGERS WOULD WORK
SOON THEY WERE LEADING THEIR PONIES IN SINGLE FILE OVER THE RIM AND DOWN THE LONG NORTHWARD SLOPE OF THE HILL DOWN INTO A FOGGY SEA AS THEY WENT DOWN THE MIST BECAME COLDER AND DAMPER AND THEIR HAIR HUNG LANK AND DRIPPING ON THEIR FOREHEADS WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM IT WAS SO COLD THAT THEY HALTED AND GOT OUT CLOAKS AND HOODS WHICH SOON BECAME BEDEWED WITH GREY DROPS THEN MOUNTING THEIR PONIES THEY WENT SLOWLY ON AGAIN FEELING THEIR WAY BY THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GROUND THEY WERE STEERING AS WELL AS THEY COULD GUESS FOR THE GATELIKE OPENING AT THE FAR NORTHWARD END OF THE LONG VALLEY WHICH THEY HAD SEEN IN THE MORNING ONCE THEY WERE THROUGH THE GAP THEY HAD ONLY TO KEEP ON IN ANYTHING LIKE A STRAIGHT LINE AND THEY WERE BOUND IN THE END TO STRIKE THE ROAD THEIR THOUGHTS DID NOT GO BEYOND THAT EXCEPT FOR A VAGUE HOPE THAT PERHAPS AWAY BEYOND THE DOWNS THERE MIGHT BE NO FOG
THEIR GOING WAS VERY SLOW TO PREVENT THEIR GETTING SEPARATED AND WANDERING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THEY WENT IN FILE WITH FRODO LEADING SAM WAS BEHIND HIM AND AFTER HIM CAME PIPPIN AND THEN MERRY THE VALLEY SEEMED TO STRETCH ON ENDLESSLY SUDDENLY FRODO SAW A HOPEFUL SIGN ON EITHER SIDE AHEAD A DARKNESS BEGAN TO LOOM THROUGH THE MIST AND HE GUESSED THAT THEY WERE AT LAST APPROACHING THE GAP IN THE HILLS THE NORTHGATE OF THE BARROWDOWNS IF THEY COULD PASS THAT THEY WOULD BE FREE
COME ON FOLLOW ME HE CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HE HURRIED FORWARD BUT HIS HOPE SOON CHANGED TO BEWILDERMENT AND ALARM THE DARK PATCHES GREW DARKER BUT THEY SHRANK AND SUDDENLY HE SAW TOWERING OMINOUS BEFORE HIM AND LEANING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER LIKE THE PILLARS OF A HEADLESS DOOR TWO HUGE STANDING STONES HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HAVING SEEN ANY SIGN OF THESE IN THE VALLEY WHEN HE LOOKED OUT FROM THE HILL IN THE MORNING HE HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM ALMOST BEFORE HE WAS AWARE AND EVEN AS HE DID SO DARKNESS SEEMED TO FALL ROUND HIM HIS PONY REARED AND SNORTED AND HE FELL OFF WHEN HE LOOKED BACK HE FOUND THAT HE WAS ALONE THE OTHERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED HIM SAM HE CALLED PIPPIN MERRY COME ALONG WHY DONT YOU KEEP UP
THERE WAS NO ANSWER FEAR TOOK HIM AND HE RAN BACK PAST THE STONES SHOUTING WILDLY SAM SAM MERRY PIPPIN THE PONY BOLTED INTO THE MIST AND VANISHED FROM SOME WAY OFF OR SO IT SEEMED HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A CRY HOY FRODO HOY IT WAS AWAY EASTWARD ON HIS LEFT AS HE STOOD UNDER THE GREAT STONES STARING AND STRAINING INTO THE GLOOM HE PLUNGED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CALL AND FOUND HIMSELF GOING STEEPLY UPHILL
AS HE STRUGGLED ON HE CALLED AGAIN AND KEPT ON CALLING MORE AND MORE FRANTICALLY BUT HE HEARD NO ANSWER FOR SOME TIME AND THEN IT SEEMED FAINT AND FAR AHEAD AND HIGH ABOVE HIM FRODO HOY CAME THE THIN VOICES OUT OF THE MIST AND THEN A CRY THAT SOUNDED LIKE HELP HELP OFTEN REPEATED ENDING WITH A LAST HELP THAT TRAILED OFF INTO A LONG WAIL SUDDENLY CUT SHORT HE STUMBLED FORWARD WITH ALL THE SPEED HE COULD TOWARDS THE CRIES BUT THE LIGHT WAS NOW GONE AND CLINGING NIGHT HAD CLOSED ABOUT HIM SO THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE SURE OF ANY DIRECTION HE SEEMED ALL THE TIME TO BE CLIMBING UP AND UP
ONLY THE CHANGE IN THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND AT HIS FEET TOLD HIM WHEN HE AT LAST CAME TO THE TOP OF A RIDGE OR HILL HE WAS WEARY SWEATING AND YET CHILLED IT WAS WHOLLY DARK
WHERE ARE YOU HE CRIED OUT MISERABLY
THERE WAS NO REPLY HE STOOD LISTENING HE WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT IT WAS GETTING VERY COLD AND THAT UP HERE A WIND WAS BEGINNING TO BLOW AN ICY WIND A CHANGE WAS COMING IN THE WEATHER THE MIST WAS FLOWING PAST HIM NOW IN SHREDS AND TATTERS HIS BREATH WAS SMOKING AND THE DARKNESS WAS LESS NEAR AND THICK HE LOOKED UP AND SAW WITH SURPRISE THAT FAINT STARS WERE APPEARING OVERHEAD AMID THE STRANDS OF HURRYING CLOUD AND FOG THE WIND BEGAN TO HISS OVER THE GRASS
HE IMAGINED SUDDENLY THAT HE CAUGHT A MUFFLED CRY AND HE MADE TOWARDS IT AND EVEN AS HE WENT FORWARD THE MIST WAS ROLLED UP AND THRUST ASIDE AND THE STARRY SKY WAS UNVEILED A GLANCE SHOWED HIM THAT HE WAS NOW FACING SOUTHWARDS AND WAS ON A ROUND HILLTOP WHICH HE MUST HAVE CLIMBED FROM THE NORTH OUT OF THE EAST THE BITING WIND WAS BLOWING TO HIS RIGHT THERE LOOMED AGAINST THE WESTWARD STARS A DARK BLACK SHAPE A GREAT BARROW STOOD THERE
WHERE ARE YOU HE CRIED AGAIN BOTH ANGRY AND AFRAID
HERE SAID A VOICE DEEP AND COLD THAT SEEMED TO COME OUT OF THE GROUND I AM WAITING FOR YOU
NO SAID FRODO BUT HE DID NOT RUN AWAY HIS KNEES GAVE AND HE FELL ON THE GROUND NOTHING HAPPENED AND THERE WAS NO SOUND TREMBLING HE LOOKED UP IN TIME TO SEE A TALL DARK FIGURE LIKE A SHADOW AGAINST THE STARS IT LEANED OVER HIM HE THOUGHT THERE WERE TWO EYES VERY COLD THOUGH LIT WITH A PALE LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM SOME REMOTE DISTANCE THEN A GRIP STRONGER AND COLDER THAN IRON SEIZED HIM THE ICY TOUCH FROZE HIS BONES AND HE REMEMBERED NO MORE
WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF AGAIN FOR A MOMENT HE COULD RECALL NOTHING EXCEPT A SENSE OF DREAD THEN SUDDENLY HE KNEW THAT HE WAS IMPRISONED CAUGHT HOPELESSLY HE WAS IN A BARROW A BARROWWIGHT HAD TAKEN HIM AND HE WAS PROBABLY ALREADY UNDER THE DREADFUL SPELLS OF THE BARROWWIGHTS ABOUT WHICH WHISPERED TALES SPOKE HE DARED NOT MOVE BUT LAY AS HE FOUND HIMSELF FLAT ON HIS BACK UPON A COLD STONE WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS BREAST
BUT THOUGH HIS FEAR WAS SO GREAT THAT IT SEEMED TO BE PART OF THE VERY DARKNESS THAT WAS ROUND HIM HE FOUND HIMSELF AS HE LAY THINKING ABOUT BILBO BAGGINS AND HIS STORIES OF THEIR JOGGING ALONG TOGETHER IN THE LANES OF THE SHIRE AND TALKING ABOUT ROADS AND ADVENTURES THERE IS A SEED OF COURAGE HIDDEN OFTEN DEEPLY IT IS TRUE IN THE HEART OF THE FATTEST AND MOST TIMID HOBBIT WAILING FOR SOME FINAL AND DESPERATE DANGER TO MAKE IT GROW FRODO WAS NEITHER VERY FAT NOR VERY TIMID INDEED THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW IT BILBO AND GANDALF HAD THOUGHT HIM THE BEST HOBBIT IN THE SHIRE HE THOUGHT HE HAD COME TO THE END OF HIS ADVENTURE AND A TERRIBLE END BUT THE THOUGHT HARDENED HIM HE FOUND HIMSELF STIFFENING AS IF FOR A FINAL SPRING HE NO LONGER FELT LIMP LIKE A HELPLESS PREY
AS HE LAY THERE THINKING AND GETTING A HOLD OF HIMSELF HE NOTICED ALL AT ONCE THAT THE DARKNESS WAS SLOWLY GIVING WAY A PALE GREENISH LIGHT WAS GROWING ROUND HIM IT DID NOT AT FIRST SHOW HIM WHAT KIND OF A PLACE HE WAS IN FOR THE LIGHT SEEMED TO BE COMING OUT OF HIMSELF AND FROM THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AND HAD NOT YET REACHED THE ROOF OR WALL HE TURNED AND THERE IN THE COLD GLOW HE SAW LYING BESIDE HIM SAM PIPPIN AND MERRY THEY WERE ON THEIR BACKS AND THEIR FACES LOOKED DEATHLY PALE AND THEY WERE CLAD IN WHITE ABOUT THEM LAY MANY TREASURES OF GOLD MAYBE THOUGH IN THAT LIGHT THEY LOOKED COLD AND UNLOVELY ON THEIR HEADS WERE CIRCLETS GOLD CHAINS WERE ABOUT THEIR WAISTS AND ON THEIR FINGERS WERE MANY RINGS SWORDS LAY BY THEIR SIDES AND SHIELDS WERE AT THEIR FEET BUT ACROSS THEIR THREE NECKS LAY ONE LONG NAKED SWORD
SUDDENLY A SONG BEGAN A COLD MURMUR RISING AND FALLING THE VOICE SEEMED FAR AWAY AND IMMEASURABLY DREARY SOMETIMES HIGH IN THE AIR AND THIN SOMETIMES LIKE A LOW MOAN FROM THE GROUND OUT OF THE FORMLESS STREAM OF SAD BUT HORRIBLE SOUNDS STRINGS OF WORDS WOULD NOW AND AGAIN SHAPE THEMSELVES GRIM HARD COLD WORDS HEARTLESS AND MISERABLE THE NIGHT WAS RAILING AGAINST THE MORNING OF WHICH IT WAS BEREAVED AND THE COLD WAS CURSING THE WARMTH FOR WHICH IT HUNGERED FRODO WAS CHILLED TO THE MARROW AFTER A WHILE THE SONG BECAME CLEARER AND WITH DREAD IN HIS HEART HE PERCEIVED THAT IT HAD CHANGED INTO AN INCANTATION
COLD BE HAND AND HEART AND BONE
AND COLD BE SLEEP UNDER STONE
NEVER MARE TO WAKE ON STONY BED
NEVER TILL THE SUN FAILS AND THE MOON IS DEAD
IN THE BLACK WIND THE STARS SHALL DIE
AND STILL ON GOLD HERE LET THEM LIE
TILL THE DARK LORD LIFTS HIS HAND
OVER DEAD SEA AND WITHERED LAND

HE HEARD BEHIND HIS HEAD A CREAKING AND SCRAPING SOUND RAISING HIMSELF ON ONE ARM HE LOOKED AND SAW NOW IN THE PALE LIGHT THAT THEY WERE IN A KIND OF PASSAGE WHICH BEHIND THEM TURNED A CORNER ROUND THE CORNER A LONG ARM WAS GROPING WALKING ON ITS FINGERS TOWARDS SAM WHO WAS LYING NEAREST AND TOWARDS THE HILT OF THE SWORD THAT LAY UPON HIM
AT FIRST FRODO FELT AS IF HE HAD INDEED BEEN TURNED INTO STONE BY THE INCANTATION THEN A WILD THOUGHT OF ESCAPE CAME TO HIM HE WONDERED IF HE PUT ON THE RING WHETHER THE BARROWWIGHT WOULD MISS HIM AND HE MIGHT FIND SOME WAY OUT HE THOUGHT OF HIMSELF RUNNING FREE OVER THE GRASS GRIEVING FOR MERRY AND SAM AND PIPPIN BUT FREE AND ALIVE HIMSELF GANDALF WOULD ADMIT THAT THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING ELSE HE COULD DO
BUT THE COURAGE THAT HAD BEEN AWAKENED IN HIM WAS NOW TOO STRONG HE COULD NOT LEAVE HIS FRIENDS SO EASILY HE WAVERED GROPING IN HIS POCKET AND THEN FOUGHT WITH HIMSELF AGAIN AND AS HE DID SO THE ARM CREPT NEARER SUDDENLY RESOLVE HARDENED IN HIM AND HE SEIZED A SHORT SWORD THAT LAY BESIDE HIM AND KNEELING HE STOOPED LOW OVER THE BODIES OF HIS COMPANIONS WITH WHAT STRENGTH HE HAD HE HEWED AT THE CRAWLING ARM NEAR THE WRIST AND THE HAND BROKE OFF BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT THE SWORD SPLINTERED UP TO THE HILT THERE WAS A SHRIEK AND THE LIGHT VANISHED IN THE DARK THERE WAS A SNARLING NOISE
FRODO FELL FORWARD OVER MERRY AND MERRYS FACE FELT COLD ALL AT ONCE BACK INTO HIS MIND FROM WHICH IT HAD DISAPPEARED WITH THE FIRST COMING OF THE FOG CAME THE MEMORY OF THE HOUSE DOWN UNDER THE HILL AND OF TOM SINGING HE REMEMBERED THE RHYME THAT TOM HAD TAUGHT THEM IN A SMALL DESPERATE VOICE HE BEGAN HO TOM BOMBADIL AND WITH THAT NAME HIS VOICE SEEMED TO GROW STRONG IT HAD A FULL AND LIVELY SOUND AND THE DARK CHAMBER ECHOED AS IF TO DRUM AND TRUMPET
HO TOM BOMBADIL TOM BOMBADILLO
BY WATER WOOD AND HILL BY THE REED AND WILLOW
BY FIRE SUN AND MOON HARKEN NOW AND HEAR US
COME TOM BOMBADIL FOR OUR NEED IS NEAR US

THERE WAS A SUDDEN DEEP SILENCE IN WHICH FRODO COULD HEAR HIS HEART BEATING AFTER A LONG SLOW MOMENT HE HEARD PLAIN BUT FAR AWAY AS IF IT WAS COMING DOWN THROUGH THE GROUND OR THROUGH THICK WALLS AN ANSWERING VOICE SINGING
OLD TOM BOMBADIL IS A MERRY FELLOW
BRIGHT BLUE HIS JACKET IS AND HIS BOOTS ARE YELLOW
NONE HAS EVER CAUGHT HIM YET FOR TOM HE IS THE MASTER
HIS SONGS ARE STRONGER SONGS AND HIS FEET ARE FASTER

THERE WAS A LOUD RUMBLING SOUND AS OF STONES ROLLING AND FALLING AND SUDDENLY LIGHT STREAMED IN REAL LIGHT THE PLAIN LIGHT OF DAY A LOW DOORLIKE OPENING APPEARED AT THE END OF THE CHAMBER BEYOND FRODOS FEET AND THERE WAS TOMS HEAD HAT FEATHER AND ALL FRAMED AGAINST THE LIGHT OF THE SUN RISING RED BEHIND HIM THE LIGHT FELL UPON THE FLOOR AND UPON THE FACES OF THE THREE HOBBITS LYING BESIDE FRODO THEY DID NOT STIR BUT THE SICKLY HUE HAD LEFT THEM THEY LOOKED NOW AS IF THEY WERE ONLY VERY DEEPLY ASLEEP
TOM STOOPED REMOVED HIS HAT AND CAME INTO THE DARK CHAMBER SINGING
GET OUT YOU OLD WIGHT VANISH IN THE SUNLIGHT
SHRIVEL LIKE THE COLD MIST LIKE THE WINDS GO WAILING
OUT INTO THE BARREN LANDS FAR BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS
COME NEVER HERE AGAIN LEAVE YOUR BARROW EMPTY
LOST AND FORGOTTEN BE DARKER THAN THE DARKNESS
WHERE GATES STAND FOR EVER SHUT TILL THE WORLD IS MENDED

AT THESE WORDS THERE WAS A CRY AND PART OF THE INNER END OF THE CHAMBER FELL IN WITH A CRASH THEN THERE WAS A LONG TRAILING SHRIEK FADING AWAY INTO AN UNGUESSABLE DISTANCE AND AFTER THAT SILENCE
COME FRIEND FRODO SAID TOM LET US GET OUT ON TO CLEAN GRASS YOU MUST HELP ME BEAR THEM
TOGETHER THEY CARRIED OUT MERRY PIPPIN AND SAM AS FRODO LEFT THE BARROW FOR THE LAST TIME HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SEVERED HAND WRIGGLING STILL LIKE A WOUNDED SPIDER IN A HEAP OF FALLEN EARTH TOM WENT BACK IN AGAIN AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF MUCH THUMPING AND STAMPING WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WAS BEARING IN HIS ARMS A GREAT LOAD OF TREASURE THINGS OF GOLD SILVER COPPER AND BRONZE MANY BEADS AND CHAINS AND JEWELLED ORNAMENTS HE CLIMBED THE GREEN BARROW AND LAID THEM ALL ON TOP IN THE SUNSHINE
THERE HE STOOD WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND THE WIND IN HIS HAIR AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE THREE HOBBITS THAT HAD BEEN LAID ON THEIR BACKS UPON THE GRASS AT THE WEST SIDE OF THE MOUND RAISING HIS RIGHT HAND HE SAID IN A CLEAR AND COMMANDING VOICE
WAKE NOW MY MERRY TADS WAKE AND HEAR ME CALLING
WARM NOW BE HEART AND LIMB THE COLD STONE IS FALLEN
DARK DOOR IS STANDING WIDE DEAD HAND IS BROKEN
NIGHT UNDER NIGHT IS FLOWN AND THE GATE IS OPEN

TO FRODOS GREAT JOY THE HOBBITS STIRRED STRETCHED THEIR ARMS RUBBED THEIR EYES AND THEN SUDDENLY SPRANG UP THEY LOOKED ABOUT IN AMAZEMENT FIRST AT FRODO AND THEN AT TOM STANDING LARGE AS LIFE ON THE BARROWTOP ABOVE THEM AND THEN AT THEMSELVES IN THEIR THIN WHITE RAGS CROWNED AND BELTED WITH PALE GOLD AND JINGLING WITH TRINKETS
WHAT IN THE NAME OF WONDER BEGAN MERRY FEELING THE GOLDEN CIRCLET THAT HAD SLIPPED OVER ONE EYE THEN HE STOPPED AND A SHADOW CAME OVER HIS FACE AND HE CLOSED HIS EYES OF COURSE I REMEMBER HE SAID THE MEN OF CARN DUM CAME ON US AT NIGHT AND WE WERE WORSTED AH THE SPEAR IN MY HEART HE CLUTCHED AT HIS BREAST NO NO HE SAID OPENING HIS EYES WHAT AM I SAYING I HAVE BEEN DREAMING WHERE DID YOU GET TO FRODO
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS LOST SAID FRODO BUT I DONT WANT TO SPEAK OF IT LET US THINK OF WHAT WE ARE TO DO NOW LET US GO ON
DRESSED UP LIKE THIS SIR SAID SAM WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE FLUNG HIS CIRCLET BELT AND RINGS ON THE GRASS AND LOOKED ROUND HELPLESSLY AS IF HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIS CLOAK JACKET AND BREECHES AND OTHER HOBBITGARMENTS LYING SOMEWHERE TO HAND
YOU WONT FIND YOUR CLOTHES AGAIN SAID TOM BOUNDING DOWN FROM THE MOUND AND LAUGHING AS HE DANCED ROUND THEM IN THE SUNLIGHT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT NOTHING DANGEROUS OR DREADFUL HAD HAPPENED AND INDEED THE HORROR FADED OUT OF THEIR HEARTS AS THEY LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW THE MERRY GLINT IN HIS EYES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED PIPPIN LOOKING AT HIM HALF PUZZLED AND HALF AMUSED WHY NOT
BUT TOM SHOOK HIS HEAD SAYING YOUVE FOUND YOURSELVES AGAIN OUT OF THE DEEP WATER CLOTHES ARE BUT LITTLE LOSS IF YOU ESCAPE FROM DROWNING BE GLAD MY MERRY FRIENDS AND LET THE WARM SUNLIGHT HEAL NOW HEART AND LIMB CAST OFF THESE COLD RAGS RUN NAKED ON THE GRASS WHILE TOM GOES AHUNTING
HE SPRANG AWAY DOWN HILL WHISTLING AND CALLING LOOKING DOWN AFTER HIM FRODO SAW HIM RUNNING AWAY SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE GREEN HOLLOW BETWEEN THEIR HILL AND THE NEXT STILL WHISTLING AND CRYING
HEY NOW COME HOY NOW WHITHER DO YOU WANDER
UP DOWN NEAR OR FAR HERE THERE OR YONDER
SHARPEARS WISENOSE SWISHTAIL AND BUMPKIN
WHITESOCKS MY LITTLE LAD AND OLD FATTY LUMPKIN

SO HE SANG RUNNING FAST TOSSING UP HIS HAT AND CATCHING IT UNTIL HE WAS HIDDEN BY A FOLD OF THE GROUND BUT FOR SOME TIME HIS HEY NOW HOY NOW CAME FLOATING BACK DOWN THE WIND WHICH HAD SHIFTED ROUND TOWARDS THE SOUTH
THE AIR WAS GROWING VERY WARM AGAIN THE HOBBITS RAN ABOUT FOR A WHILE ON THE GRASS AS HE TOLD THEM THEN THEY LAY BASKING IN THE SUN WITH THE DELIGHT OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN WAFTED SUDDENLY FROM BITTER WINTER TO A FRIENDLY CLIME OR OF PEOPLE THAT AFTER BEING LONG ILL AND BEDRIDDEN WAKE ONE DAY TO FIND THAT THEY ARE UNEXPECTEDLY WELL AND THE DAY IS AGAIN FULL OF PROMISE
BY THE TIME THAT TOM RETURNED THEY WERE FEELING STRONG AND HUNGRY HE REAPPEARED HAT FIRST OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL AND BEHIND HIM CAME IN AN OBEDIENT LINE SIX PONIES THEIR OWN FIVE AND ONE MORE THE LAST WAS PLAINLY OLD FATTY LUMPKIN HE WAS LARGER STRONGER FATTER AND OLDER THAN THEIR OWN PONIES MERRY TO WHOM THE OTHERS BELONGED HAD NOT IN FACT GIVEN THEM ANY SUCH NAMES BUT THEY ANSWERED TO THE NEW NAMES THAT TOM HAD GIVEN THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES TOM CALLED THEM ONE BY ONE AND THEY CLIMBED OVER THE BROW AND STOOD IN A LINE THEN TOM BOWED TO THE HOBBITS
HERE ARE YOUR PONIES NOW HE SAID THEYVE MORE SENSE IN SOME WAYS THAN YOU WANDERING HOBBITS HAVE  MORE SENSE IN THEIR NOSES FOR THEY SNIFF DANGER AHEAD WHICH YOU WALK RIGHT INTO AND IF THEY RUN TO SAVE THEMSELVES THEN THEY RUN THE RIGHT WAY YOU MUST FORGIVE THEM ALL FOR THOUGH THEIR HEARTS ARE FAITHFUL TO FACE FEAR OF BARROWWIGHTS IS NOT WHAT THEY WERE MADE FOR SEE HERE THEY COME AGAIN BRINGING ALL THEIR BURDENS
MERRY SAM AND PIPPIN NOW CLOTHED THEMSELVES IN SPARE GARMENTS FROM THEIR PACKS AND THEY SOON FELT TOO HOT FOR THEY WERE OBLIGED TO PUT ON SOME OF THE THICKER AND WARMER THINGS THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT AGAINST THE ONCOMING OF WINTER
WHERE DOES THAT OTHER OLD ANIMAL THAT FATTY LUMPKIN COME FROM ASKED FRODO
HES MINE SAID TOM MY FOURLEGGED FRIEND THOUGH I SELDOM RIDE HIM AND HE WANDERS OFTEN FAR FREE UPON THE HILLSIDES WHEN YOUR PONIES STAYED WITH ME THEY GOT TO KNOW MY LUMPKIN AND THEY SMELT HIM IN THE NIGHT AND QUICKLY RAN TO MEET HIM I THOUGHT HED LOOK FOR THEM AND WITH HIS WORDS OF WISDOM TAKE ALL THEIR FEAR AWAY BUT NOW MY JOLLY LUMPKIN OLD TOMS GOING TO RIDE HEY HES COMING WITH YOU JUST TO SET YOU ON THE ROAD SO HE NEEDS A PONY FOR YOU CANNOT EASILY TALK TO HOBBITS THAT ARE RIDING WHEN YOURE ON YOUR OWN LEGS TRYING TO TROT BESIDE THEM
THE HOBBITS WERE DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS AND THANKED TOM MANY TIMES BUT HE LAUGHED AND SAID THAT THEY WERE SO GOOD AT LOSING THEMSELVES THAT HE WOULD NOT FEEL HAPPY TILL HE HAD SEEN THEM SAFE OVER THE BORDERS OF HIS LAND IVE GOT THINGS TO DO HE SAID MY MAKING AND MY SINGING MY TALKING AND MY WALKING AND MY WATCHING OF THE COUNTRY TOM CANT BE ALWAYS NEAR TO OPEN DOORS AND WILLOWCRACKS TOM HAS HIS HOUSE TO MIND AND GOLDBERRY IS WAITING
IT WAS STILL FAIRLY EARLY BY THE SUN SOMETHING BETWEEN NINE AND TEN AND THE HOBBITS TURNED THEIR MINDS TO FOOD THEIR LAST MEAL HAD BEEN LUNCH BESIDE THE STANDING STONE THE DAY BEFORE THEY BREAKFASTED NOW OFF THE REMAINDER OF TOMS PROVISIONS MEANT FOR THEIR SUPPER WITH ADDITIONS THAT TOM HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM IT WAS NOT A LARGE MEAL CONSIDERING HOBBITS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY FELT MUCH BETTER FOR IT WHILE THEY WERE EATING TOM WENT UP TO THE MOUND AND LOOKED THROUGH THE TREASURES MOST OF THESE HE MADE INTO A PILE THAT GLISTENED AND SPARKLED ON THE GRASS HE BADE THEM LIE THERE FREE TO ALL FINDERS BIRDS BEASTS ELVES OR MEN AND ALL KINDLY CREATURES FOR SO THE SPELL OF THE MOUND SHOULD BE BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND NO WIGHT EVER COME BACK TO IT HE CHOSE FOR HIMSELF FROM THE PILE A BROOCH SET WITH BLUE STONES MANYSHADED LIKE FLAXFLOWERS OR THE WINGS OF BLUE BUTTERFLIES HE LOOKED LONG AT IT AS IF STIRRED BY SOME MEMORY SHAKING HIS HEAD AND SAYING AT LAST
HERE IS A PRETTY TOY FOR TOM AND FOR HIS LADY FAIR WAS SHE WHO LONG AGO WORE THIS ON HER SHOULDER GOLDBERRY SHALL WEAR IT NOW AND WE WILL NOT FORGET HER
FOR EACH OF THE HOBBITS HE CHOSE A DAGGER LONG LEAFSHAPED AND KEEN OF MARVELLOUS WORKMANSHIP DAMASKED WITH SERPENTFORMS IN RED AND GOLD THEY GLEAMED AS HE DREW THEM FROM THEIR BLACK SHEATHS WROUGHT OF SOME STRANGE METAL LIGHT AND STRONG AND SET WITH MANY FIERY STONES WHETHER BY SOME VIRTUE IN THESE SHEATHS OR BECAUSE OF THE SPELL THAT LAY ON THE MOUND THE BLADES SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY TIME UNRUSTED SHARP GLITTERING IN THE SUN
OLD KNIVES ARE LONG ENOUGH AS SWORDS FOR HOBBITPEOPLE HE SAID SHARP BLADES ARE GOOD TO HAVE IF SHIREFOLK GO WALKING EAST SOUTH OR FAR AWAY INTO DARK AND DANGER THEN HE TOLD THEM THAT THESE BLADES WERE FORGED MANY LONG YEARS AGO BY MEN OF WESTERNESSE THEY WERE FOES OF THE DARK LORD BUT THEY WERE OVERCOME BY THE EVIL KING OF CARN DUM IN THE LAND OF ANGMAR
FEW NOW REMEMBER THEM TOM MURMURED YET STILL SOME GO WANDERING SONS OF FORGOTTEN KINGS WALKING IN LONELINESS GUARDING FROM EVIL THINGS FOLK THAT ARE HEEDLESS
THE HOBBITS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS BUT AS HE SPOKE THEY HAD A VISION AS IT WERE OF A GREAT EXPANSE OF YEARS BEHIND THEM LIKE A VAST SHADOWY PLAIN OVER WHICH THERE STRODE SHAPES OF MEN TALL AND GRIM WITH BRIGHT SWORDS AND LAST CAME ONE WITH A STAR ON HIS BROW THEN THE VISION FADED AND THEY WERE BACK IN THE SUNLIT WORLD IT WAS TIME TO START AGAIN THEY MADE READY PACKING THEIR BAGS AND LADING THEIR PONIES THEIR NEW WEAPONS THEY HUNG ON THEIR LEATHER BELTS UNDER THEIR JACKETS FEELING THEM VERY AWKWARD AND WONDERING IF THEY WOULD BE OF ANY USE FIGHTING HAD NOT BEFORE OCCURRED TO ANY OF THEM AS ONE OF THE ADVENTURES IN WHICH THEIR FLIGHT WOULD LAND THEM
AT LAST THEY SET OFF THEY LED THEIR PONIES DOWN THE HILL AND THEN MOUNTING THEY TROTTED QUICKLY ALONG THE VALLEY THEY LOOKED BACK AND SAW THE TOP OF THE OLD MOUND ON THE HILL AND FROM IT THE SUNLIGHT ON THE GOLD WENT UP LIKE A YELLOW FLAME THEN THEY TURNED A SHOULDER OF THE DOWNS AND IT WAS HIDDEN FROM VIEW
THOUGH FRODO LOOKED ABOUT HIM ON EVERY SIDE HE SAW NO SIGN OF THE GREAT STONES STANDING LIKE A GATE AND BEFORE LONG THEY CAME TO THE NORTHERN GAP AND RODE SWIFTLY THROUGH AND THE LAND FELL AWAY BEFORE THEM IT WAS A MERRY JOURNEY WITH TOM BOMBADIL TROTTING GAILY BESIDE THEM OR BEFORE THEM ON FATTY LUMPKIN WHO COULD MOVE MUCH FASTER THAN HIS GIRTH PROMISED TOM SANG MOST OF THE TIME BUT IT WAS CHIEFLY NONSENSE OR ELSE PERHAPS A STRANGE LANGUAGE UNKNOWN TO THE HOBBITS AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE WHOSE WORDS WERE MAINLY THOSE OF WONDER AND DELIGHT
THEY WENT FORWARD STEADILY BUT THEY SOON SAW THAT THE ROAD WAS FURTHER AWAY THAN THEY HAD IMAGINED EVEN WITHOUT A FOG THEIR SLEEP AT MIDDAY WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THEM FROM REACHING IT UNTIL AFTER NIGHTFALL ON THE DAY BEFORE THE DARK LINE THEY HAD SEEN WAS NOT A LINE OF TREES BUT A LINE OF BUSHES GROWING ON THE EDGE OF A DEEP DIKE WITH A STEEP WALL ON THE FURTHER SIDE TOM SAID THAT IT HAD ONCE BEEN THE BOUNDARY OF A KINGDOM BUT A VERY LONG LIME AGO HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER SOMETHING SAD ABOUT IT AND WOULD NOT SAY MUCH
THEY CLIMBED DOWN AND OUT OF THE DIKE AND THROUGH A GAP IN THE WALL AND THEN TOM TURNED DUE NORTH FOR THEY HAD BEEN BEARING SOMEWHAT TO THE WEST THE LAND WAS NOW OPEN AND FAIRLY LEVEL AND THEY QUICKENED THEIR PACE BUT THE SUN WAS ALREADY SINKING LOW WHEN AT LAST THEY SAW A LINE OF TALL TREES AHEAD AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD COME BACK TO THE ROAD AFTER MANY UNEXPECTED ADVENTURES THEY GALLOPED THEIR PONIES OVER THE LAST FURLONGS AND HALTED UNDER THE LONG SHADOWS OF THE TREES THEY WERE ON THE TOP OF A SLOPING BANK AND THE ROAD NOW DIM AS EVENING DREW ON WOUND AWAY BELOW THEM AT THIS POINT IT RAN NEARLY FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AND ON THEIR RIGHT IT FELL QUICKLY DOWN INTO A WIDE HOLLOW IT WAS RUTTED AND BORE MANY SIGNS OF THE RECENT HEAVY RAIN THERE WERE POOLS AND POTHOLES FULL OF WATER THEY RODE DOWN THE BANK AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
WELL HERE WE ARE AGAIN AT LAST SAID FRODO I SUPPOSE WE HAVENT LOST MORE THAN TWO DAYS BY MY SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FOREST BUT PERHAPS THE DELAY WILL PROVE USEFUL  IT MAY HAVE PUT THEM OFF OUR TRAIL
THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM THE SHADOW OF THE FEAR OF THE BLACK RIDERS CAME SUDDENLY OVER THEM AGAIN EVER SINCE THEY HAD ENTERED THE FOREST THEY HAD THOUGHT CHIEFLY OF GETTING BACK TO THE ROAD ONLY NOW WHEN IT LAY BENEATH THEIR FEET DID THEY REMEMBER THE DANGER WHICH PURSUED THEM AND WAS MORE THAN LIKELY TO BE LYING IN WAIT FOR THEM UPON THE ROAD ITSELF THEY LOOKED ANXIOUSLY BACK TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN BUT THE ROAD WAS BROWN AND EMPTY
DO YOU THINK ASKED PIPPIN HESITATINGLY DO YOU THINK WE MAY BE PURSUED TONIGHT
NO I HOPE NOT TONIGHT ANSWERED TOM BOMBADIL NOR PERHAPS THE NEXT DAY BUT DO NOT TRUST MY GUESS FOR I CANNOT TELL FOR CERTAIN OUT EAST MY KNOWLEDGE FAILS TOM IS NOT MASTER OF RIDERS FROM THE BLACK LAND FAR BEYOND HIS COUNTRY
ALL THE SAME THE HOBBITS WISHED HE WAS COMING WITH THEM THEY FELT THAT HE WOULD KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH BLACK RIDERS IF ANYONE DID THEY WOULD SOON NOW BE GOING FORWARD INTO LANDS WHOLLY STRANGE TO THEM AND BEYOND ALL BUT THE MOST VAGUE AND DISTANT LEGENDS OF THE SHIRE AND IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT THEY LONGED FOR HOME A DEEP LONELINESS AND SENSE OF LOSS WAS ON THEM THEY STOOD SILENT RELUCTANT TO MAKE THE FINAL PARTING AND ONLY SLOWLY BECAME AWARE THAT TOM WAS WISHING THEM FAREWELL AND TELLING THEM TO HAVE GOOD HEART AND TO RIDE ON TILL DARK WITHOUT HALTING
TOM WILL GIVE YOU GOOD ADVICE TILL THIS DAY IS OVER AFTER THAT YOUR OWN LUCK MUST GO WITH YOU AND GUIDE YOU FOUR MILES ALONG THE ROAD YOULL COME UPON A VILLAGE BREE UNDER BREEHILL WITH DOORS LOOKING WESTWARD THERE YOULL FIND AN OLD INN THAT IS CALLED THE PRANCING PONY BARLIMAN BUTTERBUR IS THE WORTHY KEEPER THERE YOU CAN STAY THE NIGHT AND AFTERWARDS THE MORNING WILL SPEED YOU UPON YOUR WAY BE BOLD BUT WARY KEEP UP YOUR MERRY HEARTS AND RIDE TO MEET YOUR FORTUNE
THEY BEGGED HIM TO COME AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE INN AND DRINK ONCE MORE WITH THEM BUT HE LAUGHED AND REFUSED SAYING
TOMS COUNTRY ENDS HERE HE WILL NOT PASS THE BORDERS
TOM HAS HIS HOUSE TO MIND AND GOLDBERRY IS WAITING

THEN HE TURNED TOSSED UP HIS HAT LEAPED ON LUMPKINS BACK AND RODE UP OVER THE BANK AND AWAY SINGING INTO THE DUSK
THE HOBBITS CLIMBED UP AND WATCHED HIM UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
I AM SORRY TO TAKE LEAVE OF MASTER BOMBADIL SAID SAM HES A CAUTION AND NO MISTAKE I RECKON WE MAY GO A GOOD DEAL FURTHER AND SEE NAUGHT BETTER NOR QUEERER BUT I WONT DENY ILL BE GLAD TO SEE THIS PRANCING PONY HE SPOKE OF I HOPE ITLL BE LIKE THE GREEN DRAGON AWAY BACK HOME WHAT SORT OF FOLK ARE THEY IN BREE
THERE ARE HOBBITS IN BREE SAID MERRY AS WELL AS BIG FOLK I DARESAY IT WILL BE HOMELIKE ENOUGH THE PONY IS A GOOD INN BY ALL ACCOUNTS MY PEOPLE RIDE OUT THERE NOW AND AGAIN
IT MAY BE ALL WE COULD WISH SAID FRODO BUT IT IS OUTSIDE THE SHIRE ALL THE SAME DONT MAKE YOURSELVES TOO MUCH AT HOME PLEASE REMEMBER ALL OF YOU  THAT THE NAME OF BAGGINS MUST NOT BE MENTIONED I AM MR UNDERHILL IF ANY NAME MUST BE GIVEN
THEY NOW MOUNTED THEIR PONIES AND RODE OFF SILENTLY INTO THE EVENING DARKNESS CAME DOWN QUICKLY AS THEY PLODDED SLOWLY DOWNHILL AND UP AGAIN UNTIL AT LAST THEY SAW LIGHTS TWINKLING SOME DISTANCE AHEAD
BEFORE THEM ROSE BREEHILL BARRING THE WAY A DARK MASS AGAINST MISTY STARS AND UNDER ITS WESTERN FLANK NESTLED A LARGE VILLAGE TOWARDS IT THEY NOW HURRIED DESIRING ONLY TO FIND A FIRE AND A DOOR BETWEEN THEM AND THE NIGHT



CHAPTER 9
AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY

BREE WAS THE CHIEF VILLAGE OF THE BREELAND A SMALL INHABITED REGION LIKE AN ISLAND IN THE EMPTY LANDS ROUND ABOUT BESIDES BREE ITSELF THERE WAS STADDLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL COMBE IN A DEEP VALLEY A LITTLE FURTHER EASTWARD AND ARCHET ON THE EDGE OF THE CHETWOOD LYING ROUND BREEHILL AND THE VILLAGES WAS A SMALL COUNTRY OF FIELDS AND TAMED WOODLAND ONLY A FEW MILES BROAD
THE MEN OF BREE WERE BROWNHAIRED BROAD AND RATHER SHORT CHEERFUL AND INDEPENDENT THEY BELONGED TO NOBODY BUT THEMSELVES BUT THEY WERE MORE FRIENDLY AND FAMILIAR WITH HOBBITS DWARVES ELVES AND OTHER INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD ABOUT THEM THAN WAS OR IS USUAL WITH BIG PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN TALES THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS AND WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF THE FIRST MEN THAT EVER WANDERED INTO THE WEST OF THE MIDDLEWORLD FEW HAD SURVIVED THE TURMOILS OF THE ELDER DAYS BUT WHEN THE KINGS RETURNED AGAIN OVER THE GREAT SEA THEY HAD FOUND THE BREEMEN STILL THERE AND THEY WERE STILL THERE NOW WHEN THE MEMORY OF THE OLD KINGS HAD FADED INTO THE GRASS
IN THOSE DAYS NO OTHER MEN HAD SETTLED DWELLINGS SO FAR WEST OR WITHIN A HUNDRED LEAGUES OF THE SHIRE BUT IN THE WILD LANDS BEYOND BREE THERE WERE MYSTERIOUS WANDERERS THE BREEFOLK CALLED THEM RANGERS AND KNEW NOTHING OF THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE TALLER AND DARKER THAN THE MEN OF BREE AND WERE BELIEVED TO HAVE STRANGE POWERS OF SIGHT AND HEARING AND TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGES OF BEASTS AND BIRDS THEY ROAMED AT WILL SOUTHWARDS AND EASTWARDS EVEN AS FAR AS THE MISTY MOUNTAINS BUT THEY WERE NOW FEW AND RARELY SEEN WHEN THEY APPEARED THEY BROUGHT NEWS FROM AFAR AND TOLD STRANGE FORGOTTEN TALES WHICH WERE EAGERLY LISTENED TO BUT THE BREEFOLK DID NOT MAKE FRIENDS OF THEM
THERE WERE ALSO MANY FAMILIES OF HOBBITS IN THE BREELAND AND THEY CLAIMED TO BE THE OLDEST SETTLEMENT OF HOBBITS IN THE WORLD ONE THAT WAS FOUNDED LONG BEFORE EVEN THE BRANDYWINE WAS CROSSED AND THE SHIRE COLONIZED THEY LIVED MOSTLY IN STADDLE THOUGH THERE WERE SOME IN BREE ITSELF ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHER SLOPES OF THE HILL ABOVE THE HOUSES OF THE MEN THE BIG FOLK AND THE LITTLE FOLK AS THEY CALLED ONE ANOTHER WERE ON FRIENDLY TERMS MINDING THEIR OWN AFFAIRS IN THEIR OWN WAYS BUT BOTH RIGHTLY REGARDING THEMSELVES AS NECESSARY PARTS OF THE BREEFOLK NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD WAS THIS PECULIAR BUT EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENT TO BE FOUND
THE BREEFOLK BIG AND LITTLE DID NOT THEMSELVES TRAVEL MUCH AND THE AFFAIRS OF THE FOUR VILLAGES WERE THEIR CHIEF CONCERN OCCASIONALLY THE HOBBITS OF BREE WENT AS FAR AS BUCKLAND OR THE EASTFARTHING BUT THOUGH THEIR LINK LAND WAS NOT MUCH FURTHER THAN A DAYS RIDING EAST OF THE BRANDYWINE BRIDGE THE HOBBITS OF THE SHIRE NOW SELDOM VISITED IT AN OCCASIONAL BUCKLANDER OR ADVENTUROUS TOOK WOULD COME OUT TO THE INN FOR A NIGHT OR TWO BUT EVEN THAT WAS BECOMING LESS AND LESS USUAL THE SHIREHOBBITS REFERRED TO THOSE OF BREE AND TO ANY OTHERS THAT LIVED BEYOND THE BORDERS AS OUTSIDERS AND TOOK VERY LITTLE INTEREST IN THEM CONSIDERING THEM DULL AND UNCOUTH THERE WERE PROBABLY MANY MORE OUTSIDERS SCATTERED ABOUT IN THE WEST OF THE WORLD IN THOSE DAYS THAN THE PEOPLE OF THE SHIRE IMAGINED SOME DOUBTLESS WERE NO BETTER THAN TRAMPS READY TO DIG A HOLE IN ANY BANK AND STAY ONLY AS LONG AS IT SUITED THEM BUT IN THE BREELAND AT ANY RATE THE HOBBITS WERE DECENT AND PROSPEROUS AND NO MORE RUSTIC THAN MOST OF THEIR DISTANT RELATIVES INSIDE IT WAS NOT YET FORGOTTEN THAT THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN THERE WAS MUCH COMING AND GOING BETWEEN THE SHIRE AND BREE THERE WAS BREEBLOOD IN THE BRANDYBUCKS BY ALL ACCOUNTS
THE VILLAGE OF BREE HAD SOME HUNDRED STONE HOUSES OF THE BIG FOLK MOSTLY ABOVE THE ROAD NESTLING ON THE HILLSIDE WITH WINDOWS LOOKING WEST ON THAT SIDE RUNNING IN MORE THAN HALF A CIRCLE FROM THE HILL AND BACK TO IT THERE WAS A DEEP DIKE WITH A THICK HEDGE ON THE INNER SIDE OVER THIS THE ROAD CROSSED BY A CAUSEWAY BUT WHERE IT PIERCED THE HEDGE IT WAS BARRED BY A GREAT GATE THERE WAS ANOTHER GATE IN THE SOUTHERN COMER WHERE THE ROAD RAN OUT OF THE VILLAGE THE GATES WERE CLOSED AT NIGHTFALL BUT JUST INSIDE THEM WERE SMALL LODGES FOR THE GATEKEEPERS
DOWN ON THE ROAD WHERE IT SWEPT TO THE RIGHT TO GO ROUND THE FOOT OF THE HILL THERE WAS A LARGE INN IT HAD BEEN BUILT LONG AGO WHEN THE TRAFFIC ON THE ROADS HAD BEEN FAR GREATER FOR BREE STOOD AT AN OLD MEETING OF WAYS ANOTHER ANCIENT ROAD CROSSED THE EAST ROAD JUST OUTSIDE THE DIKE AT THE WESTERN END OF THE VILLAGE AND IN FORMER DAYS MEN AND OTHER FOLK OF VARIOUS SORTS HAD TRAVELLED MUCH ON IT STRANGE AS NEWS FROM BREE WAS STILL A SAYING IN THE EASTFARTHING DESCENDING FROM THOSE DAYS WHEN NEWS FROM NORTH SOUTH AND EAST COULD BE HEARD IN THE INN AND WHEN THE SHIREHOBBITS USED TO GO MORE OFTEN TO HEAR IT BUT THE NORTHERN LANDS HAD LONG BEEN DESOLATE AND THE NORTH ROAD WAS NOW SELDOM USED IT WAS GRASSGROWN AND THE BREEFOLK CALLED IT THE GREENWAY
THE INN OF BREE WAS STILL THERE HOWEVER AND THE INNKEEPER WAS AN IMPORTANT PERSON HIS HOUSE WAS A MEETING PLACE FOR THE IDLE TALKATIVE AND INQUISITIVE AMONG THE INHABITANTS LARGE AND SMALL OF THE FOUR VILLAGES AND A RESORT OF RANGERS AND OTHER WANDERERS AND FOR SUCH TRAVELLERS MOSTLY DWARVES AS STILL JOURNEYED ON THE EAST ROAD TO AND FROM THE MOUNTAINS
IT WAS DARK AND WHITE STARS WERE SHINING WHEN FRODO AND HIS COMPANIONS CAME AT LAST TO THE GREENWAYCROSSING AND DREW NEAR THE VILLAGE THEY CAME TO THE WESTGATE AND FOUND IT SHUT BUT AT THE DOOR OF THE LODGE BEYOND IT THERE WAS A MAN SITTING HE JUMPED UP AND FETCHED A LANTERN AND LOOKED OVER THE GATE AT THEM IN SURPRISE
WHAT DO YOU WANT AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM HE ASKED GRUFFLY
WE ARE MAKING FOR THE INN HERE ANSWERED FRODO WE ARE JOURNEYING EAST AND CANNOT GO FURTHER TONIGHT
HOBBITS FOUR HOBBITS AND WHATS MORE OUT OF THE SHIRE BY THEIR TALK SAID THE GATEKEEPER SOFTLY AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF HE STARED AT THEM DARKLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SLOWLY OPENED THE GATE AND LET THEM RIDE THROUGH
WE DONT OFTEN SEE SHIREFOLK RIDING ON THE ROAD AT NIGHT HE WENT ON AS THEY HALTED A MOMENT BY HIS DOOR YOULL PARDON MY WONDERING WHAT BUSINESS TAKES YOU AWAY EAST OF BREE WHAT MAY YOUR NAMES BE MIGHT I ASK
OUR NAMES AND OUR BUSINESS ARE OUR OWN AND THIS DOES NOT SEEM A GOOD PLACE TO DISCUSS THEM SAID FRODO NOT LIKING THE LOOK OF THE MAN OR THE TONE OF HIS VOICE
YOUR BUSINESS IS YOUR OWN NO DOUBT SAID THE MAN BUT ITS MY BUSINESS TO ASK QUESTIONS AFTER NIGHTFALL
WE ARE HOBBITS FROM BUCKLAND AND WE HAVE A FANCY TO TRAVEL AND TO STAY AT THE INN HERE PUT IN MERRY I AM MR BRANDYBUCK IS THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU THE BREEFOLK USED TO BE FAIRSPOKEN TO TRAVELLERS OR SO I HAD HEARD
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT SAID THE MAN I MEANT NO OFFENCE BUT YOULL FIND MAYBE THAT MORE FOLK THAN OLD HARRY AT THE GATE WILL BE ASKING YOU QUESTIONS THERES QUEER FOLK ABOUT IF YOU GO ON TO THE PONY YOULL FIND YOURE NOT THE ONLY GUESTS
HE WISHED THEM GOOD NIGHT AND THEY SAID NO MORE BUT FRODO COULD SEE IN THE LANTERNLIGHT THAT THE MAN WAS STILL EYEING THEM CURIOUSLY HE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THE GATE CLANG TO BEHIND THEM AS THEY RODE FORWARD HE WONDERED WHY THE MAN WAS SO SUSPICIOUS AND WHETHER ANY ONE HAD BEEN ASKING FOR NEWS OF A PARTY OF HOBBITS COULD IT HAVE BEEN GANDALF HE MIGHT HAVE ARRIVED WHILE THEY WERE DELAYED IN THE FOREST AND THE DOWNS BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE LOOK AND THE VOICE OF THE GATEKEEPER THAT MADE HIM UNEASY
THE MAN STARED AFTER THE HOBBITS FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HE WENT BACK TO HIS HOUSE AS SOON AS HIS BACK WAS TURNED A DARK FIGURE CLIMBED QUICKLY IN OVER THE GATE AND MELTED INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE VILLAGE STREET
THE HOBBITS RODE ON UP A GENTLE SLOPE PASSING A FEW DETACHED HOUSES AND DREW UP OUTSIDE THE INN THE HOUSES LOOKED LARGE AND STRANGE TO THEM SAM STARED UP AT THE INN WITH ITS THREE STOREYS AND MANY WINDOWS AND FELT HIS HEART SINK HE HAD IMAGINED HIMSELF MEETING GIANTS TALLER THAN TREES AND OTHER CREATURES EVEN MORE TERRIFYING SOME TIME OR OTHER IN THE COURSE OF HIS JOURNEY BUT AT THE MOMENT HE WAS FINDING HIS FIRST SIGHT OF MEN AND THEIR TALL HOUSES QUITE ENOUGH INDEED TOO MUCH FOR THE DARK END OF A TIRING DAY HE PICTURED BLACK HORSES STANDING ALL SADDLED IN THE SHADOWS OF THE INNYARD AND BLACK RIDERS PEERING OUT OF DARK UPPER WINDOWS
WE SURELY ARENT GOING TO STAY HERE FOR THE NIGHT ARE WE SIR HE EXCLAIMED IF THERE ARE HOBBITFOLK IN THESE PANS WHY DONT WE LOOK FOR SOME THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE US IN IT WOULD BE MORE HOMELIKE
WHATS WRONG WITH THE INN SAID FRODO TOM BOMBADIL RECOMMENDED IT I EXPECT ITS HOMELIKE ENOUGH INSIDE
EVEN FROM THE OUTSIDE THE INN LOOKED A PLEASANT HOUSE TO FAMILIAR EYES IT HAD A FRONT ON THE ROAD AND TWO WINGS RUNNING BACK ON LAND PARTLY CUT OUT OF THE LOWER SLOPES OF THE HILL SO THAT AT THE REAR THE SECONDFLOOR WINDOWS WERE LEVEL WITH THE GROUND THERE WAS A WIDE ARCH LEADING TO A COURTYARD BETWEEN THE TWO WINGS AND ON THE LEFT UNDER THE ARCH THERE WAS A LARGE DOORWAY REACHED BY A FEW BROAD STEPS THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND LIGHT STREAMED OUT OF IT ABOVE THE ARCH THERE WAS A LAMP AND BENEATH IT SWUNG A LARGE SIGNBOARD A FAT WHITE PONY REARED UP ON ITS HIND LEGS OVER THE DOOR WAS PAINTED IN WHITE LETTERSTHE PRANCING PONYBY BARLIMAN BUTTERBUR MANY OF THE LOWER WINDOWS SHOWED LIGHTS BEHIND THICK CURTAINS
AS THEY HESITATED OUTSIDE IN THE GLOOM SOMEONE BEGAN SINGING A MERRY SONG INSIDE AND MANY CHEERFUL VOICES JOINED LOUDLY IN THE CHORUS THEY LISTENED TO THIS ENCOURAGING SOUND FOR A MOMENT AND THEN GOT OFF THEIR PONIES THE SONG ENDED AND THERE WAS A BURST OF LAUGHTER AND CLAPPING
THEY LED THEIR PONIES UNDER THE ARCH AND LEAVING THEM STANDING IN THE YARD THEY CLIMBED UP THE STEPS FRODO WENT FORWARD AND NEARLY BUMPED INTO A SHORT FAT MAN WITH A BALD HEAD AND A RED FACE HE HAD A WHITE APRON ON AND WAS BUSTLING OUT OF ONE DOOR AND IN THROUGH ANOTHER CARRYING A TRAY LADEN WITH FULL MUGS

SO REFRESHED AND ENCOURAGED DID THEY FEEL AT THE END OF THEIR SUPPER ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOURS STEADY GOING NOT HINDERED BY UNNECESSARY TALK THAT FRODO PIPPIN AND SAM DECIDED TO JOIN THE COMPANY MERRY SAID IT WOULD BE TOO STUFFY I SHALL SIT HERE QUIETLY BY THE FIRE FOR A BIT AND PERHAPS GO OUT LATER FOR A SNIFF OF THE AIR MIND YOUR PS AND QS AND DONT FORGET THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ESCAPING IN SECRET AND ARE STILL ON THE HIGHROAD AND NOT VERY FAR FROM THE SHIRE
ALL RIGHT SAID PIPPIN MIND YOURSELF DONT GET LOST AND DONT FORGET THAT IT IS SAFER INDOORS
THE COMPANY WAS IN THE BIG COMMONROOM OF THE INN THE GATHERING WAS LARGE AND MIXED AS FRODO DISCOVERED WHEN HIS EYES GOT USED TO THE LIGHT THIS CAME CHIEFLY FROM A BLAZING LOGFIRE FOR THE THREE LAMPS HANGING FROM THE BEAMS WERE DIM AND HALF VEILED IN SMOKE BARLIMAN BUTTERBUR WAS STANDING NEAR THE FIRE TALKING TO A COUPLE OF DWARVES AND ONE OR TWO STRANGELOOKING MEN ON THE BENCHES WERE VARIOUS FOLK MEN OF BREE A COLLECTION OF LOCAL HOBBITS SITTING CHATTERING TOGETHER A FEW MORE DWARVES AND OTHER VAGUE FIGURES DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT AWAY IN THE SHADOWS AND COMERS
AS SOON AS THE SHIREHOBBITS ENTERED THERE WAS A CHORUS OF WELCOME FROM THE BREELANDERS THE STRANGERS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAD COME UP THE GREENWAY STARED AT THEM CURIOUSLY THE LANDLORD INTRODUCED THE NEWCOMERS TO THE BREEFOLK SO QUICKLY THAT THOUGH THEY CAUGHT MANY NAMES THEY WERE SELDOM SURE WHO THE NAMES BELONGED TO THE MEN OF BREE SEEMED ALL TO HAVE RATHER BOTANICAL AND TO THE SHIREFOLK RATHER ODD NAMES LIKE RUSHLIGHT GOATLEAF HEATHERTOES APPLEDORE THISTLEWOOL AND FERNY NOT TO MENTION BUTTERBUR SOME OF THE HOBBITS HAD SIMILAR NAMES THE MUGWORTS FOR INSTANCE SEEMED NUMEROUS BUT MOST OF THEM HAD NATURAL NAMES SUCH AS BANKS BROCKHOUSE LONGHOLES SANDHEAVER AND TUNNELLY MANY OF WHICH WERE USED IN THE SHIRE THERE WERE SEVERAL UNDERHILLS FROM SADDLE AND AS THEY COULD NOT IMAGINE SHARING A NAME WITHOUT BEING RELATED THEY TOOK FRODO TO THEIR HEARTS AS A LONGLOST COUSIN
THE BREEHOBBITS WERE IN FACT FRIENDLY AND INQUISITIVE AND FRODO SOON FOUND THAT SOME EXPLANATION OF WHAT HE WAS DOING WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN HE GAVE OUT THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY AT WHICH THERE WAS MUCH WAGGING OF HEADS ALTHOUGH NEITHER OF THESE WORDS WERE MUCH USED IN THE BREEDIALECT HE SAID HE WAS THINKING OF WRITING A BOOK AT WHICH THERE WAS SILENT ASTONISHMENT AND THAT HE AND HIS FRIENDS WANTED TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT HOBBITS LIVING OUTSIDE THE SHIRE ESPECIALLY IN THE EASTERN LANDS
AT THIS A CHORUS OF VOICES BROKE OUT IF FRODO HAD REALLY WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK AND HAD HAD MANY EARS HE WOULD HAVE LEARNED ENOUGH FOR SEVERAL CHAPTERS IN A FEW MINUTES AND IF THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH HE WAS GIVEN A WHOLE LIST OF NAMES BEGINNING WITH OLD BARLIMAN HERE TO WHOM HE COULD GO FOR FURTHER INFORMATION BUT AFTER A TIME AS FRODO DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGN OF WRITING A BOOK ON THE SPOT THE HOBBITS RETURNED TO THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT DOINGS IN THE SHIRE FRODO DID NOT PROVE VERY COMMUNICATIVE AND HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF SITTING ALONE IN A COMER LISTENING AND LOOKING AROUND
THE MEN AND DWARVES WERE MOSTLY TALKING OF DISTANT EVENTS AND TELLING FLEWS OF A KIND THAT WAS BECOMING ONLY TOO FAMILIAR THERE WAS TROUBLE AWAY IN THE SOUTH AND IT SEEMED THAT THE MEN WHO HAD COME UP THE GREENWAY WERE ON THE MOVE LOOKING FOR LANDS WHERE THEY COULD FIND SOME PEACE THE BREEFOLK WERE SYMPATHETIC BUT PLAINLY NOT VERY READY TO TAKE A LARGE NUMBER OF STRANGERS INTO THEIR LITTLE LAND ONE OF THE TRAVELLERS A SQUINTEYED ILLFAVOURED FELLOW WAS FORETELLING THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE COMING NORTH IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF ROOM ISNT FOUND FOR THEM THEYLL FIND IT FOR THEMSELVES THEYVE A RIGHT TO LIVE SAME AS OTHER FOLK HE SAID LOUDLY THE LOCAL INHABITANTS DID NOT LOOK PLEASED AT THE PROSPECT
THE HOBBITS DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO ALL THIS AND IT DID NOT AT THE MOMENT SEEM TO CONCERN HOBBITS BIG FOLK COULD HARDLY BEG FOR LODGINGS IN HOBBITHOLES THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN SAM AND PIPPIN WHO WERE NOW FEELING QUITE AT HOME AND WERE CHATTING GAILY ABOUT EVENTS IN THE SHIRE PIPPIN ROUSED A GOOD DEAL OF LAUGHTER WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE ROOF OF THE TOWN HOLE IN MICHEL DELVING WILL WHITFOOT THE MAYOR AND THE FATTEST HOBBIT IN THE WESTFARTHING HAD BEEN BURIED IN CHALK AND CAME OUT LIKE A FLOURED DUMPLING BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL QUESTIONS ASKED THAT MADE FRODO A LITTLE UNEASY ONE OF THE BREELANDERS WHO SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IN THE SHIRE SEVERAL TIMES WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE UNDERHILLS LIVED AND WHO THEY WERE RELATED TO
SUDDENLY FRODO NOTICED THAT A STRANGELOOKING WEATHERBEATEN MAN SITTING IN THE SHADOWS NEAR THE WALL WAS ALSO LISTENING INTENTLY TO THE HOBBITTALK HE HAD A TALL TANKARD IN FRONT OF HIM AND WAS SMOKING A LONGSTEMMED PIPE CURIOUSLY CARVED HIS LEGS WERE STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM SHOWING HIGH BOOTS OF SUPPLE LEATHER THAT FITTED HIM WELL BUT HAD SEEN MUCH WEAR AND WERE NOW CAKED WITH MUD A TRAVELSTAINED CLOAK OF HEAVY DARKGREEN CLOTH WAS DRAWN CLOSE ABOUT HIM AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAT OF THE ROOM HE WORE A HOOD THAT OVERSHADOWED HIS FACE BUT THE GLEAM OF HIS EYES COULD BE SEEN AS HE WATCHED THE HOBBITS
WHO IS THAT FRODO ASKED WHEN HE GOT A CHANCE TO WHISPER TO MR BUTTERBUR I DONT THINK YOU INTRODUCED HIM
HIM SAID THE LANDLORD IN AN ANSWERING WHISPER COCKING AN EYE WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD I DONT RIGHTLY KNOW HE IS ONE OF THE WANDERING FOLK  RANGERS WE CALL THEM HE SELDOM TALKS NOT BUT WHAT HE CAN TELL A RARE TALE WHEN HE HAS THE MIND HE DISAPPEARS FOR A MONTH OR A YEAR AND THEN HE POPS UP AGAIN HE WAS IN AND OUT PRETTY OFTEN LAST SPRING BUT I HAVENT SEEN HIM ABOUT LATELY WHAT HIS RIGHT NAME IS IVE NEVER HEARD BUT HES KNOWN ROUND HERE AS STRIDER GOES ABOUT AT A GREAT PACE ON HIS LONG SHANKS THOUGH HE DONT TELL NOBODY WHAT CAUSE HE HAS TO HURRY BUT THERES NO ACCOUNTING FOR EAST AND WEST AS WE SAY IN BREE MEANING THE RANGERS AND THE SHIREFOLK BEGGING YOUR PARDON FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK ABOUT HIM BUT AT THAT MOMENT MR BUTTERBUR WAS CALLED AWAY BY A DEMAND FOR MORE ALE AND HIS LAST REMARK REMAINED UNEXPLAINED
FRODO FOUND THAT STRIDER WAS NOW LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE HAD HEARD OR GUESSED ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID PRESENTLY WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND AND A NOD HE INVITED FRODO TO COME OVER AND SIT BY HIM AS FRODO DREW NEAR BE THREW BACK HIS HOOD SHOWING A SHAGGY HEAD OF DARK HAIR NECKED WITH GREY AND IN A PALE STEM FACE A PAIR OF KEEN GREY EYES
I AM CALLED STRIDER HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE I AM VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU MASTER  UNDERHILL IF OLD BUTTERBUR GOT YOUR NAME RIGHT
HE DID SAID FRODO STIFFLY HE FELT FAR FROM COMFORTABLE UNDER THE STARE OF THOSE KEEN EYES
WELL MASTER UNDERHILL SAID STRIDER IF I WERE YOU I SHOULD STOP YOUR YOUNG FRIENDS FROM TALKING TOO MUCH DRINK FIRE AND CHANCEMEETING ARE PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT WELL  THIS ISNT THE SHIRE THERE ARE QUEER FOLK ABOUT THOUGH I SAY IT AS SHOULDNT YOU MAY THINK HE ADDED WITH A WRY SMILE SEEING FRODOS GLANCE AND THERE HAVE BEEN EVEN STRANGER TRAVELLERS THROUGH BREE LATELY HE WENT ON WATCHING FRODOS FACE
FRODO RETURNED HIS GAZE BUT SAID NOTHING AND STRIDER MADE NO FURTHER SIGN HIS ATTENTION SEEMED SUDDENLY TO BE FIXED ON PIPPIN TO HIS ALARM FRODO BECAME AWARE THAT THE RIDICULOUS YOUNG TOOK ENCOURAGED BY HIS SUCCESS WITH THE FAT MAYOR OF MICHEL DELVING WAS NOW ACTUALLY GIVING A COMIC ACCOUNT OF BILBOS FAREWELL PARTY HE WAS ALREADY GIVING AN IMITATION OF THE SPEECH AND WAS DRAWING NEAR TO THE ASTONISHING DISAPPEARANCE
FRODO WAS ANNOYED IT WAS A HARMLESS ENOUGH TALE FOR MOST OF THE LOCAL HOBBITS NO DOUBT JUST A FUNNY STORY ABOUT THOSE FUNNY PEOPLE AWAY BEYOND THE RIVER BUT SOME OLD BUTTERBUR FOR INSTANCE KNEW A THING OR TWO AND HAD PROBABLY HEARD RUMOURS LONG AGO ABOUT BILBOS VANISHING IT WOULD BRING THE NAME OF BAGGINS TO THEIR MINDS ESPECIALLY IF THERE HAD BEEN INQUIRIES IN BREE AFTER THAT NAME
FRODO FIDGETED WONDERING WHAT TO DO PIPPIN WAS EVIDENTLY MUCH ENJOYING THE ATTENTION HE WAS GETTING AND HAD BECOME QUITE FORGETFUL OF THEIR DANGER FRODO HAD A SUDDEN FEAR THAT IN HIS PRESENT MOOD HE MIGHT EVEN MENTION THE RING AND THAT MIGHT WELL BE DISASTROUS
YOU HAD BETTER DO SOMETHING QUICK WHISPERED STRIDER IN HIS EAR
FRODO JUMPED UP AND STOOD ON A TABLE AND BEGAN TO TALK THE ATTENTION OF PIPPINS AUDIENCE WAS DISTURBED SOME OF THE HOBBITS LOOKED AT FRODO AND LAUGHED AND CLAPPED THINKING THAT MR UNDERHILL HAD TAKEN AS MUCH ALE AS WAS GOOD FOR HIM
FRODO SUDDENLY FELT VERY FOOLISH AND FOUND HIMSELF AS WAS HIS HABIT WHEN MAKING A SPEECH FINGERING THE THINGS IN HIS POCKET HE FELT THE RING ON ITS CHAIN AND QUITE UNACCOUNTABLY THE DESIRE CAME OVER HIM TO SLIP IT ON AND VANISH OUT OF THE SILLY SITUATION IT SEEMED TO HIM SOMEHOW AS IF ME SUGGESTION CAME TO HIM FROM OUTSIDE FROM SOMEONE OR SOMETHING A THE ROOM HE RESISTED THE TEMPTATION FIRMLY AND CLASPED THE RING IN HIS HAND AS IF TO KEEP A HOLD ON IT AND PREVENT IT FROM ESCAPING OR DOING ANY MISCHIEF AT ANY RATE IT GAVE HIM NO INSPIRATION HE SPOKE A FEW SUITABLE WORDS AS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID IN THE SHIRE WE ARE ALL VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE KINDNESS OF YOUR RECEPTION AND I VENTURE TO HOPE THAT MY BRIEF VISIT WILL HELP TO RENEW THE OLD TIES OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE SHIRE AND BREE AND THEN HE HESITATED AND COUGHED
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WAS NOW LOOKING AT HIM A SONG SHOUTED ONE OF THE HOBBITS A SONG A SONG SHOUTED ALL THE OTHERS COME ON NOW MASTER SING US SOMETHING THAT WE HAVENT HEARD BEFORE
FOR A MOMENT FRODO STOOD GAPING THEN IN DESPERATION HE BEGAN A RIDICULOUS SONG THAT BILBO HAD BEEN RATHER FOND OF AND INDEED RATHER PROUD OF FOR HE HAD MADE UP THE WORDS HIMSELF IT WAS ABOUT AN INN AND THAT IS PROBABLY WHY IT CAME INTO FRODOS MIND JUST THEN HERE IT IS IN FULL ONLY A FEW WORDS OF IT ARE NOW AS A RULE REMEMBERED
THERE IS AN INN A MERRY OLD INN
BENEATH AN OLD GREY HILL
AND THERE THEY BREW A BEER SO BROWN
THAT THE MAN IN THE MOON HIMSELF CAME DOWN
ONE NIGHT TO DRINK HIS FILL

THE OSTLER HAS A TIPSY CAT
THAT PLAYS A FIVESTRINGED FIDDLE
AND UP AND DOWN HE RUNS HIS BOW
NOW SQUEAKING HIGH NOW PURRING LOW
NOW SAWING IN THE MIDDLE

THE LANDLORD KEEPS A LITTLE DOG
THAT IS MIGHTY FOND OF JOKES
WHEN THERES GOOD CHEER AMONG THE GUESTS
HE COCKS AN EAR AT ALL THE JESTS
AND LAUGHS UNTIL HE CHOKES

THEY ALSO KEEP A HORNED COW
AS PROUD AS ANY QUEEN
BUT MUSIC TURNS HER HEAD LIKE ALE
AND MAKES HER WAVE HER TUFTED TAIL
AND DANCE UPON THE GREEN

AND O THE ROWS OF SILVER DISHES
AND THE STORE OF SILVER SPOONS
FOR SUNDAY5THERES A SPECIAL PAIR
AND THESE THEY POLISH UP WITH CARE
ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS

THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS DRINKING DEEP
AND THE CAT BEGAN TO WAIL
A DISH AND A SPOON ON THE TABLE DANCED
THE COW IN THE GARDEN MADLY PRANCED
AND THE LITTLE DOG CHASED HIS TAIL

THE MAN IN THE MOON TOOK ANOTHER MUG
AND THEN ROLLED BENEATH HIS CHAIR
AND THERE HE DOZED AND DREAMED OF ALE
TILL IN THE SKY THE STARS WERE PALE
AND DAWN WAS IN THE AIR

THEN THE OSTLER SAID TO HIS TIPSY CAT
THE WHITE HORSES OF THE MOON
THEY NEIGH AND CHAMP THEIR SILVER BITS
BUT THEIR MASTERS BEEN AND DROWNED HIS WITS
AND THE SUNLL BE RISING SOON

SO THE CAT ON HIS FIDDLE PLAYED HEYDIDDLEDIDDLE
A JIG THAT WOULD WAKE THE DEAD
HE SQUEAKED AND SAWED AND QUICKENED THE TUNE
WHILE THE LANDLORD SHOOK THE MAN IN THE MOON
ITS AFTER THREE HE SAID

THEY ROLLED THE MAN SLOWLY UP THE HILL
AND BUNDLED HIM INTO THE MOON
WHILE HIS HORSES GALLOPED UP IN REAR
AND THE COW CAME CAPERING LIKE A DEER
AND A DISH RAN UP WITH THE SPOON

NOW QUICKER THE FIDDLE WENT DEEDLEDUMDIDDLE
THE DOG BEGAN TO ROAR
THE COW AND THE HORSES STOOD ON THEIR HEADS
THE GUESTS ALL BOUNDED FROM THEIR BEDS
AND DANCED UPON THE FLOOR

WITH A PING AND A PONG THE FIDDLESTRINGS BROKE
THE COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON
AND THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED TO SEE SUCH FUN
AND THE SATURDAY DISH WENT OFF AT A RUN
WITH THE SILVER SUNDAY SPOON

THE ROUND MOON ROLLED BEHIND THE HILL
AS THE SUN RAISED UP HER HEAD
SHE6HARDLY BELIEVED HER FIERY EYES
FOR THOUGH IT WAS DAY TO HER SURPRISE
THEY ALL WENT BACK TO BED

THERE WAS LOUD AND LONG APPLAUSE FRODO HAD A GOOD VOICE AND THE SONG TICKLED THEIR FANCY WHERES OLD BARLEY THEY CRIED HE OUGHT TO HEAR THIS BOB OUGHT TO LEARN HIS CAT THE FIDDLE AND THEN WED HAVE A DANCE THEY CALLED FOR MORE ALE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT LETS HAVE IT AGAIN MASTER COME ON NOW ONCE MORE
THEY MADE FRODO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK AND THEN BEGIN HIS SONG AGAIN WHILE MANY OF THEM JOINED IN FOR THE TUNE WAS WELL KNOWN AND THEY WERE QUICK AT PICKING UP WORDS IT WAS NOW FRODOS TURN TO FEEL PLEASED WITH HIMSELF HE CAPERED ABOUT ON THE TABLE AND WHEN HE CAME A SECOND TIME TO THE COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON HE LEAPED IN THE AIR MUCH TOO VIGOROUSLY FOR HE CAME DOWN BANG INTO A TRAY FULL OF MUGS AND SLIPPED AND ROLLED OFF THE TABLE WITH A CRASH CLATTER AND BUMP THE AUDIENCE ALL OPENED THEIR MOUTHS WIDE FOR LAUGHTER AND STOPPED SHORT A GAPING SILENCE FOR THE SINGER DISAPPEARED HE SIMPLY VANISHED AS IF HE HAD GONE SLAP THROUGH THE FLOOR WITHOUT LEAVING A HOLE

THE LOCAL HOBBITS STARED IN AMAZEMENT AND THEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET AND SHOUTED FOR BARLIMAN ALL THE COMPANY DREW AWAY FROM PIPPIN AND SAM WHO FOUND THEMSELVES LEFT ALONE IN A CORNER AND EYED DARKLY AND DOUBTFULLY FROM A DISTANCE IT WAS PLAIN THAT MANY PEOPLE REGARDED THEM NOW AS THE COMPANIONS OF A TRAVELLING MAGICIAN OF UNKNOWN POWERS AND PURPOSE BUT THERE WAS ONE SWARTHY BREELANDER WHO STOOD LOOKING AT THEM WITH A KNOWING AND HALFMOCKING EXPRESSION THAT MADE THEM FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE PRESENTLY HE SLIPPED OUT OF THE DOOR FOLLOWED BY THE SQUINTEYED SOUTHERNER THE TWO HAD BEEN WHISPERING TOGETHER A GOOD DEAL DURING THE EVENING HARRY THE GATEKEEPER ALSO WENT OUT JUST BEHIND THEM
FRODO FELT A FOOL NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO HE CRAWLED AWAY UNDER THE TABLES TO THE DARK COMER BY STRIDER WHO SAT UNMOVED GIVING NO SIGN OF HIS THOUGHTS FRODO LEANED BACK AGAINST THE WALL AND TOOK OFF THE RING HOW IT CAME TO BE ON HIS FINGER HE COULD NOT TELL HE COULD ONLY SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD BEEN HANDLING IT IN HIS POCKET WHILE HE SANG AND THAT SOMEHOW IT HAD SLIPPED ON WHEN HE STUCK OUT HIS HAND WITH A JERK TO SAVE HIS FALL FOR A MOMENT HE WONDERED IF THE RING ITSELF HAD NOT PLAYED HIM A TRICK PERHAPS IT HAD TRIED TO REVEAL ITSELF IN RESPONSE TO SOME WISH OR COMMAND THAT WAS FELT IN THE ROOM HE DID NOT LIKE THE LOOKS OF THE MEN THAT HAD GONE OUT
WELL SAID STRIDER WHEN HE REAPPEARED WHY DID YOU DO THAT WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOUR FRIENDS COULD HAVE SAID YOU HAVE PUT YOUR FOOT IN IT OR SHOULD I SAY YOUR FINGER
I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID FRODO ANNOYED AND ALARMED
OH YES YOU DO ANSWERED STRIDER BUT WE HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL THE UPROAR HAS DIED DOWN THEN IF YOU PLEASE MR BAGGINS I SHOULD LIKE A QUIET WORD WITH YOU
WHAT ABOUT ASKED FRODO IGNORING THE SUDDEN USE OF HIS PROPER NAME
A MATTER OF SOME IMPORTANCE  TO US BOTH ANSWERED STRIDER LOOKING FRODO IN THE EYE YOU MAY HEAR SOMETHING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
VERY WELL SAID FRODO TRYING TO APPEAR UNCONCERNED ILL TALK TO YOU LATER
MEANWHILE AN ARGUMENT WAS GOING ON BY THE FIREPLACE MR BUTTERBUR HAD COME TROTTING IN AND HE WAS NOW TRYING TO LISTEN TO SEVERAL CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF THE EVENT AT THE SAME TIME
I SAW HIM MR BUTTERBUR SAID A HOBBIT OR LEASTWAYS I DIDNT SEE HIM IF YOU TAKE MY MEANING HE JUST VANISHED INTO THIN AIR IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING

YOURS IN HASTE
GANDALF

PS DO NOT USE IT AGAIN NOT FAR ANY REASON WHATEVER DO NOT TRAVEL BY NIGHT

PPS MAKE SURE THAT IT IS THE REAL STRIDER THERE ARE MANY STRANGE MEN ON THE ROADS HIS TRUE NAME IS ARAGORN

ALL THAT IS GOLD DOES NOT GLITTER
NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST
THE OLD THAT IS STRONG DOES NOT WITHER
DEEP ROOTS ARE NOT REACHED BY THE FROST
FROM THE ASHES A FIRE SHALL BE WOKEN
A LIGHT FROM THE SHADOWS SHALL SPRING
RENEWED SHALL BE BLADE THAT WAS BROKEN
THE CROWNLESS AGAIN SHALL BE KING

PPPS I HOPE BUTTERBUR SENDS THIS PROMPTLY A WORTHY MAN BUT HIS MEMORY IS LIKE A LUMBERROAM THING WANTED ALWAYS BURIED IF HE FORGETS I SHALL ROAST HIM
FARE WELL
FRODO READ THE LETTER TO HIMSELF AND THEN PASSED IT TO PIPPIN AND SAM REALLY OLD BUTTERBUR HAS MADE A MESS OF THINGS HE SAID HE DESERVES ROASTING IF I HAD GOT THIS AT ONCE WE MIGHT ALL HAVE BEEN SAFE IN RIVENDELL BY NOW BUT WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED TO GANDALF HE WRITES AS IF HE WAS GOING INTO GREAT DANGER
HE HAS BEEN DOING THAT FOR MANY YEARS SAID STRIDER
FRODO TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY WONDERING ABOUT GANDALFS SECOND POSTSCRIPT WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME THAT YOU WERE GANDALFS FRIEND AT ONCE HE ASKED IT WOULD HAVE SAVED TIME
WOULD IT WOULD ANY OF YOU HAVE BELIEVED ME TILL NOW SAID STRIDER I KNEW NOTHING OF THIS LETTER FOR ALL I KNEW I HAD TO PERSUADE YOU TO TRUST ME WITHOUT PROOFS IF I WAS TO HELP YOU IN ANY CASE I DID NOT INTEND TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT MYSELF AT ONCE I HAD TO STUDY YOU FIRST AND MAKE SURE OF YOU THE ENEMY HAS SET TRAPS FOR ME BEFORE NOW AS SOON AS I HAD MADE UP MY MIND I WAS READY TO TELL YOU WHATEVER YOU ASKED BUT I MUST ADMIT HE ADDED WITH A QUEER LAUGH THAT I HOPED YOU WOULD TAKE TO ME FOR MY OWN SAKE A HUNTED MAN SOMETIMES WEARIES OF DISTRUST AND LONGS FOR FRIENDSHIP BUT THERE I BELIEVE MY LOOKS ARE AGAINST ME
THEY ARE  AT FIRST SIGHT AT ANY RATE LAUGHED PIPPIN WITH SUDDEN RELIEF AFTER READING GANDALFS LETTER BUT HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES AS WE SAY IN THE SHIRE AND I DARESAY WE SHALL ALL LOOK MUCH THE SAME AFTER LYING FOR DAYS IN HEDGES AND DITCHES
IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS OR YEARS OF WANDERING IN THE WILD TO MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE STRIDER HE ANSWERED AND YOU WOULD DIE FIRST UNLESS YOU ARE MADE OF STERNER STUFF THAN YOU LOOK TO BE
PIPPIN SUBSIDED BUT SAM WAS NOT DAUNTED AND HE STILL EYED STRIDER DUBIOUSLY HOW DO WE KNOW YOU ARE THE STRIDER THAT GANDALF SPEAKS ABOUT HE DEMANDED YOU NEVER MENTIONED GANDALF TILL THIS LETTER CAME OUT YOU MIGHT BE A PLAYACTING SPY FOR ALL I CAN SEE TRYING TO GET US TO GO WITH YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE IN THE REAL STRIDER AND TOOK HIS CLOTHES WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY TO THAT
THAT YOU ARE A STOUT FELLOW ANSWERED STRIDER BUT I AM AFRAID MY ONLY ANSWER TO YOU SAM GAMGEE IS THIS IF I HAD KILLED THE REAL STRIDER I COULD KILL YOU AND I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU ALREADY WITHOUT SO MUCH TALK IF I WAS AFTER THE RING I COULD HAVE IT  NOW
HE STOOD UP AND SEEMED SUDDENLY TO GROW TALLER IN HIS EYES GLEAMED A LIGHT KEEN AND COMMANDING THROWING BACK HIS CLOAK HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF A SWORD THAT HAD HUNG CONCEALED BY HIS SIDE THEY DID NOT DARE TO MOVE SAM SAT WIDEMOUTHED STARING AT HIM DUMBLY
BUT I AM THE REAL STRIDER FORTUNATELY HE SAID LOOKING DOWN AT THEM WITH HIS FACE SOFTENED BY A SUDDEN SMILE I AM ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN AND IF BY LIFE OR DEATH I CAN SAVE YOU I WILL
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE AT LAST FRODO SPOKE WITH HESITATION I BELIEVED THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND BEFORE THE LETTER CAME HE SAID OR AT LEAST I WISHED TO YOU HAVE FRIGHTENED ME SEVERAL TIMES TONIGHT BUT NEVER IN THE WAY THAT SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY WOULD OR SO I IMAGINE I THINK ONE OF HIS SPIES WOULD  WELL SEEM FAIRER AND FEEL FOULER IF YOU UNDERSTAND
I SEE LAUGHED STRIDER I LOOK FOUL AND FEEL FAIR IS THAT IT ALL THAT IS GOLD DOES NOT GLITTER NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDERARE LOST
DID THE VERSES APPLY TO YOU THEN ASKED FRODO I COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE IN GANDALFS LETTER IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IT
I DID NOT KNOW HE ANSWERED BUT I AM ARAGORN AND THOSE VERSES GO WITH THAT NAME HE DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND THEY SAW THAT THE BLADE WAS INDEED BROKEN A FOOT BELOW THE HILT NOT MUCH USE IS IT SAM SAID STRIDER BUT THE TIME IS NEAR WHEN IT SHALL BE FORGED ANEW
SAM SAID NOTHING
WELL SAID STRIDER WITH SAMS PERMISSION WE WILL CALL THAT SETTLED STRIDER SHALL BE YOUR GUIDE WE SHALL HAVE A ROUGH ROAD TOMORROW EVEN IF WE ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE BREE UNHINDERED WE CAN HARDLY HOPE NOW TO LEAVE IT UNNOTICED BUT I SHALL TRY TO GET LOST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I KNOW ONE OR TWO WAYS OUT OF BREELAND OTHER THAN THE MAIN ROAD IF ONCE WE SHAKE OFF THE PURSUIT I SHALL MAKE FOR WEATHERTOP
WEATHERTOP SAID SAM WHATS THAT
IT IS A HILL JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE ROAD ABOUT HALF WAY FROM HERE TO RIVENDELL IT COMMANDS A WIDE VIEW ALL ROUND AND THERE WE SHALL HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK ABOUT US GANDALF WILL MAKE FOR THAT POINT IF HE FOLLOWS US AFTER WEATHERTOP OUR JOURNEY WILL BECOME MORE DIFFICULT AND WE SHALL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN VARIOUS DANGERS
WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE GANDALF ASKED FRODO DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS OR WHAT HE IS DOING
STRIDER LOOKED GRAVE I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID I CAME WEST WITH HIM IN THE SPRING I HAVE OFTEN KEPT WATCH ON THE BORDERS OF THE SHIRE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WHEN HE WAS BUSY ELSEWHERE HE SELDOM LEFT IT UNGUARDED WE LAST MET ON THE FIRST OF MAY AT SARN FORD DOWN THE BRANDYWINE HE TOLD ME THAT HIS BUSINESS WITH YOU HAD GONE WELL AND THAT YOU WOULD BE STARTING FOR RIVENDELL IN THE LAST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER AS I KNEW HE WAS AT YOUR SIDE I WENT AWAY ON A JOURNEY OF MY OWN AND THAT HAS PROVED ILL FOR PLAINLY SOME NEWS REACHED HIM AND I WAS NOT AT HAND TO HELP
I AM TROUBLED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I HAVE KNOWN HIM WE SHOULD HAVE HAD MESSAGES EVEN IF HE COULD NOT COME HIMSELF WHEN I RETURNED MANY DAYS AGO I HEARD THE ILL NEWS THE TIDINGS HAD GONE FAR AND WIDE THAT GANDALF WAS MISSING AND THE HORSEMEN HAD BEEN SEEN IT WAS THE ELVENFOLK OF GILDOR THAT TOLD ME THIS AND LATER THEY TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD LEFT YOUR HOME BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF YOUR LEAVING BUCKLAND I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE EAST ROAD ANXIOUSLY
DO YOU THINK THE BLACK RIDERS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT  WITH GANDALFS ABSENCE I MEAN ASKED FRODO
I DO NOT KNOW OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD HAVE HINDERED HIM EXCEPT THE ENEMY HIMSELF SAID STRIDER BUT DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE GANDALF IS GREATER THAN YOU SHIREFOLK KNOW  AS A RULE YOU CAN ONLY SEE HIS JOKES AND TOYS BUT THIS BUSINESS OF OURS WILL BE HIS GREATEST TASK
PIPPIN YAWNED I AM SORRY HE SAID BUT I AM DEAD TIRED IN SPITE OF ALL THE DANGER AND WORRY I MUST GO TO BED OR SLEEP WHERE I SIT WHERE IS THAT SILLY FELLOW MERRY IT WOULD BE THE LAST STRAW IF WE HAD TO GO OUT IN THE DARK TO LOOK FOR HIM
AT THAT MOMENT THEY HEARD A DOOR SLAM THEN FEET CAME RUNNING ALONG THE PASSAGE MERRY CAME IN WITH A RUSH FOLLOWED BY NOB HE SHUT THE DOOR HASTILY AND LEANED AGAINST IT HE WAS OUT OF BREATH THEY STARED AT HIM IN ALARM FOR A MOMENT BEFORE HE GASPED I HAVE SEEN THEM FRODO I HAVE SEEN THEM BLACK RIDERS
BLACK RIDERS CRIED FRODO WHERE
HERE IN THE VILLAGE I STAYED INDOORS FOR AN HOUR THEN AS YOU DID NOT COME BACK I WENT OUT FOR A STROLL I HAD COME BACK AGAIN AND WAS STANDING JUST OUTSIDE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP LOOKING AT THE STARS SUDDENLY I SHIVERED AND FELT THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS CREEPING NEAR THERE WAS A SORT OF DEEPER SHADE AMONG THE SHADOWS ACROSS THE ROAD JUST BEYOND THE EDGE OF THE LAMPLIGHT IT SLID AWAY AT ONCE INTO THE DARK WITHOUT A SOUND THERE WAS NO HORSE
WHICH WAY DID IT GO ASKED STRIDER SUDDENLY AND SHARPLY MERRY STARTED NOTICING THE STRANGER FOR THE FIRST TIME GO ON SAID FRODO THIS IS A FRIEND OF GANDALFS I WILL EXPLAIN LATER
IT SEEMED TO MAKE OFF UP THE ROAD EASTWARD CONTINUED MERRY I TRIED TO FOLLOW OF COURSE IT VANISHED ALMOST AT ONCE BUT I WENT ROUND THE CORNER AND ON AS FAR AS THE LAST HOUSE ON THE ROAD
STRIDER LOOKED AT MERRY WITH WONDER YOU HAVE A STOUT HEART HE SAID BUT IT WAS FOOLISH
I DONT KNOW SAID MERRY NEITHER BRAVE NOR SILLY I THINK I COULD HARDLY HELP MYSELF I SEEMED TO BE DRAWN SOMEHOW ANYWAY I WENT AND SUDDENLY I HEARD VOICES BY THE HEDGE ONE WAS MUTTERING AND THE OTHER WAS WHISPERING OR HISSING I COULDNT HEAR A WORD THAT WAS SAID I DID NOT CREEP ANY CLOSER BECAUSE I BEGAN TO TREMBLE ALL OVER THEN I FELT TERRIFIED AND I TURNED BACK AND WAS JUST GOING TO BOLT HOME WHEN SOMETHING CAME BEHIND ME AND I I FELL OVER
I FOUND HIM SIR PUT IN NOB MR BUTTERBUR SENT ME OUT WITH A LANTERN I WENT DOWN TO WESTGATE AND THEN BACK UP TOWARDS SOUTHGATE JUST NIGH BILL FERNYS HOUSE I THOUGHT I COULD SEE SOMETHING IN THE ROAD I COULDNT SWEAR TO IT BUT IT LOOKED TO ME AS IF TWO MEN WAS STOOPING OVER SOMETHING LILTING IT I GAVE A SHOUT BUT WHERE I GOT UP TO THE SPOT THERE WAS NO SIGNS OF THEM AND ONLY MR BRANDYBUCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE HE SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP I THOUGHT I HAD FALLEN INTO DEEP WATER HE SAYS TO ME WHEN I SHOOK HIM VERY QUEER HE WAS AND AS SOON AS I HAD ROUSED HIM HE GOT UP AND RAN BACK HERE LIKE A HARE
I AM AFRAID THATS TRUE SAID MERRY THOUGH I DONT KNOW WHAT I SAID I HAD AN UGLY DREAM WHICH I CANT REMEMBER I WENT TO PIECES I DONT KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME
I DO SAID STRIDER THE BLACK BREATH THE RIDERS MUST HAVE LEFT THEIR HORSES OUTSIDE AND PASSED BACK THROUGH THE SOUTHGATE IN SECRET THEY WILL KNOW ALL THE NEWS NOW FOR THEY HAVE VISITED BILL FERNY AND PROBABLY THAT SOUTHERNER WAS A SPY AS WELL SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN IN THE NIGHT BEFORE WE LEAVE BREE
WHAT WILL HAPPEN SAID MERRY WILL THEY ATTACK THE INN
NO I THINK NOT SAID STRIDER THEY ARE NOT ALL HERE YET AND IN ANY CASE THAT IS NOT THEIR WAY IN DARK AND LONELINESS THEY ARE STRONGEST THEY WILL NOT OPENLY ATTACK A HOUSE WHERE THERE ARE LIGHTS AND MANY PEOPLE  NOT UNTIL THEY ARE DESPERATE NOT WHILE ALL THE LONG LEAGUES OF ERIADOR STILL LIE BEFORE US BUT THEIR POWER IS IN TERROR AND ALREADY SOME IN BREE ARE IN THEIR CLUTCH THEY WILL DRIVE THESE WRETCHES TO SOME EVIL WORK FERNY AND SOME OF THE STRANGERS AND MAYBE THE GATEKEEPER TOO THEY HAD WORDS WITH HARRY AT WESTGATE ON MONDAY I WAS WATCHING THEM HE WAS WHITE AND SHAKING WHEN THEY LEFT HIM
WE SEEM TO HAVE ENEMIES ALL ROUND SAID FRODO WHAT ARE WE TO DO
STAY HERE AND DO NOT GO TO YOUR ROOMS THEY ARE SURE TO HAVE FOUND OUT WHICH THOSE ARE THE HOBBITROOMS HAVE WINDOWS LOOKING NORTH AND CLOSE TO THE GROUND WE WILL ALL REMAIN TOGETHER AND BAR THIS WINDOW AND THE DOOR BUT FIRST NOB AND I WILL FETCH YOUR LUGGAGE
WHILE STRIDER WAS GONE FRODO GAVE MERRY A RAPID ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE SUPPER MERRY WAS STILL READING AND PONDERING GANDALFS LETTER WHEN STRIDER AND NOB RETURNED
WELL MASTERS SAID NOB IVE RUFFLED UP THE CLOTHES AND PUT IN A BOLSTER DOWN THE MIDDLE OF EACH BED AND I MADE A NICE IMITATION OF YOUR HEAD WITH A BROWN WOOLLEN MAT MR BAG  UNDERHILL SIR HE ADDED WITH A GRIN

GOOD NIGHT TO YOU SAID NOB AND WENT OFF TO TAKE HIS PART IN THE WATCH ON THE DOORS
THEIR BAGS AND GEAR THEY PILED ON THE PARLOURFLOOR THEY PUSHED A LOW CHAIR AGAINST THE DOOR AND SHUT THE WINDOW PEERING OUT FRODO SAW THAT THE NIGHT WAS STILL CLEAR THE SICKLE WAS SWINGING BRIGHT ABOVE THE SHOULDERS OF BREEHILL HE THEN CLOSED AND BARRED THE HEAVY INSIDE SHUTTERS AND DREW THE CURTAINS TOGETHER STRIDER BUILT UP THE FIRE AND BLEW OUT ALL THE CANDLES
THE HOBBITS LAY DOWN ON THEIR BLANKETS WITH THEIR FEET TOWARDS THE HEARTH BUT STRIDER SETTLED HIMSELF IN THE CHAIR AGAINST THE DOOR THEY TALKED FOR A LITTLE FOR MERRY STILL HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS TO ASK
JUMPED OVER THE MOON CHUCKLED MERRY AS HE ROLLED HIMSELF IN HIS BLANKET VERY RIDICULOUS OF YOU FRODO BUT I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE THE WORTHIES OF BREE WILL BE DISCUSSING IT A HUNDRED YEARS HENCE
I HOPE SO SAID STRIDER THEN THEY ALL FELL SILENT AND ONE BY ONE THE HOBBITS DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP



CHAPTER 11
A KNIFE IN THE DARK

AS THEY PREPARED FOR SLEEP IN THE INN AT BREE DARKNESS LAY ON BUCKLAND A MIST STRAYED IN THE DELLS AND ALONG THE RIVERBANK THE HOUSE AT CRICKHOLLOW STOOD SILENT FATTY BOLGER OPENED THE DOOR CAUTIOUSLY AND PEERED OUT A FEELING OF FEAR HAD BEEN GROWING ON HIM ALL DAY AND HE WAS UNABLE TO REST OR GO TO BED THERE WAS A BROODING THREAT IN THE BREATHLESS NIGHTAIR AS HE STARED OUT INTO THE GLOOM A BLACK SHADOW MOVED UNDER THE TREES THE GATE SEEMED TO OPEN OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND CLOSE AGAIN WITHOUT A SOUND TERROR SEIZED HIM HE SHRANK BACK AND FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD TREMBLING IN THE HALL THEN HE SHUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR

THE NIGHT DEEPENED THERE CAME THE SOFT SOUND OF HORSES LED WITH STEALTH ALONG THE LANE OUTSIDE THE GATE THEY STOPPED AND THREE BLACK FIGURES ENTERED LIKE SHADES OF NIGHT CREEPING ACROSS THE GROUND ONE WENT TO THE DOOR ONE TO THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE ON EITHER SIDE AND THERE THEY STOOD AS STILL AS THE SHADOWS OF STONES WHILE NIGHT WENT SLOWLY ON THE HOUSE AND THE QUIET TREES SEEMED TO BE WAITING BREATHLESSLY
THERE WAS A FAINT STIR IN THE LEAVES AND A COCK CROWED FAR AWAY THE COLD HOUR BEFORE DAWN WAS PASSING THE FIGURE BY THE DOOR MOVED IN THE DARK WITHOUT MOON OR STARS A DRAWN BLADE GLEAMED AS IF A CHILL LIGHT HAD BEEN UNSHEATHED THERE WAS A BLOW SOFT BUT HEAVY AND THE DOOR SHUDDERED
OPEN IN THE NAME OF MORDOR SAID A VOICE THIN AND MENACING
AT A SECOND BLOW THE DOOR YIELDED AND FELL BACK WITH TIMBERS BURST AND LOCK BROKEN THE BLACK FIGURES PASSED SWIFTLY IN
AT THAT MOMENT AMONG THE TREES NEARBY A HORN RANG OUT IT RENT THE NIGHT LIKE FIRE ON A HILLTOP
AWAKE FEAR FIRE FOES AWAKE
FATTY BOLGER HAD NOT BEEN IDLE AS SOON AS HE SAW THE DARK SHAPES CREEP FROM THE GARDEN HE KNEW THAT HE MUST RUN FOR IT OR PERISH AND RUN HE DID OUT OF THE BACK DOOR THROUGH THE GARDEN AND OVER THE FIELDS WHEN HE REACHED THE NEAREST HOUSE MORE THAN A MILE AWAY HE COLLAPSED ON THE DOORSTEP NO NO NO HE WAS CRYING NO NOT ME I HAVENT GOT IT IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD MAKE OUT WHAT HE WAS BABBLING ABOUT AT LAST THEY GOT THE IDEA THAT ENEMIES WERE IN BUCKLAND SOME STRANGE INVASION FROM THE OLD FOREST AND THEN THEY LOST NO MORE TIME
FEAR FIRE FOES
THE BRANDYBUCKS WERE BLOWING THE HORNCALL OF BUCKLAND THAT HAD NOT BEEN SOUNDED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS NOT SINCE THE WHITE WOLVES CAME IN THE FELL WINTER WHEN THE BRANDYWINE WAS FROZEN OVER
AWAKE AWAKE
FARAWAY ANSWERING HORNS WERE HEARD THE ALARM WAS SPREADING THE BLACK FIGURES FLED FROM THE HOUSE ONE OF THEM LET FALL A HOBBITCLOAK ON THE STEP AS HE RAN IN THE LANE THE NOISE OF HOOFS BROKE OUT AND GATHERING TO A GALLOP WENT HAMMERING AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS ALL ABOUT CRICKHOLLOW THERE WAS THE SOUND OF HORNS BLOWING AND VOICES CRYING AND FEET RUNNING BUT THE BLACK RIDERS RODE LIKE A GALE TO THE NORTHGATE LET THE LITTLE PEOPLE BLOW SAURON WOULD DEAL WITH THEM LATER MEANWHILE THEY HAD ANOTHER ERRAND THEY KNEW NOW THAT THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND THE RING HAD GONE THEY RODE DOWN THE GUARDS AT THE GATE AND VANISHED FROM THE SHIRE
IN THE EARLY NIGHT FRODO WOKE FROM DEEP SLEEP SUDDENLY AS IF SOME SOUND OR PRESENCE HAD DISTURBED HIM HE SAW THAT STRIDER WAS SITTING ALERT IN HIS CHAIR HIS EYES GLEAMED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN TENDED AND WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY BUT HE MADE NO SIGN OR MOVEMENT
FRODO SOON WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN BUT HIS DREAMS WERE AGAIN TROUBLED WITH THE NOISE OF WIND AND OF GALLOPING HOOFS THE WIND SEEMED TO BE CURLING ROUND THE HOUSE AND SHAKING IT AND FAR OFF HE HEARD A HORN BLOWING WILDLY HE OPENED HIS EYES AND HEARD A COCK CROWING LUSTILY IN THE INNYARD STRIDER HAD DRAWN THE CURTAINS AND PUSHED BACK THE SHUTTERS WITH A CLANG THE FIRST GREY LIGHT OF DAY WAS IN THE ROOM AND A COLD AIR WAS COMING THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW
AS SOON AS STRIDER HAD ROUSED THEM ALL HE LED THE WAY TO THEIR BEDROOMS WHEN THEY SAW THEM THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY HAD TAKEN HIS ADVICE THE WINDOWS HAD BEEN FORCED OPEN AND WERE SWINGING AND THE CURTAINS WERE FLAPPING THE BEDS WERE TOSSED ABOUT AND THE BOLSTERS SLASHED AND FLUNG UPON THE FLOOR THE BROWN MAT WAS TORN TO PIECES
STRIDER IMMEDIATELY WENT TO FETCH THE LANDLORD POOR MR BUTTERBUR LOOKED SLEEPY AND FRIGHTENED HE HAD HARDLY CLOSED HIS EYES ALL NIGHT SO HE SAID BUT HE HAD NEVER HEARD A SOUND
NEVER HAS SUCH A THING HAPPENED IN MY TIME HE CRIED RAISING HIS HANDS IN HORROR GUESTS UNABLE TO SLEEP IN THEIR BEDS AND GOOD BOLSTERS RUINED AND ALL WHAT ARE WE COMING TO
DARK TIMES SAID STRIDER BUT FOR THE PRESENT YOU MAY BE LEFT IN PEACE WHEN YOU HAVE GOT RID OF US WE WILL LEAVE AT ONCE NEVER MIND ABOUT BREAKFAST A DRINK AND A BITE STANDING WILL HAVE TO DO WE SHALL BE PACKED IN A FEW MINUTES
MR BUTTERBUR HURRIED OFF TO SEE THAT THEIR PONIES WERE GOT READY AND TO FETCH THEM A BITE BUT VERY SOON HE CAME BACK IN DISMAY THE PONIES HAD VANISHED THE STABLEDOORS HAD ALL BEEN OPENED IN THE NIGHT AND THEY WERE GONE NOT ONLY MERRYS PONIES BUT EVERY OTHER HORSE AND BEAST IN THE PLACE
FRODO WAS CRUSHED BY THE NEWS HOW COULD THEY HOPE TO REACH RIVENDELL ON FOOT PURSUED BY MOUNTED ENEMIES THEY MIGHT AS WELL SET OUT FOR THE MOON STRIDER SAT SILENT FOR A WHILE LOOKING AT THE HOBBITS AS IF HE WAS WEIGHING UP THEIR STRENGTH AND COURAGE
PONIES WOULD NOT HELP US TO ESCAPE HORSEMEN HE SAID AT LAST THOUGHTFULLY AS IF HE GUESSED WHAT FRODO HAD IN MIND WE SHOULD NOT GO MUCH SLOWER ON FOOT NOT ON THE ROADS THAT I MEAN TO TAKE I WAS GOING TO WALK IN ANY CASE IT IS THE FOOD AND STORES THAT TROUBLE ME WE CANNOT COUNT ON GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT BETWEEN HERE AND RIVENDELL EXCEPT WHAT WE TAKE WITH US AND WE OUGHT TO TAKE PLENTY TO SPARE FOR WE MAY BE DELAYED OR FORCED TO GO ROUNDABOUT FAR OUT OF THE DIRECT WAY HOW MUCH ARE YOU PREPARED TO CARRY ON YOUR BACKS
AS MUCH AS WE MUST SAID PIPPIN WITH A SINKING HEART BUT TRYING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS TOUGHER THAN HE LOOKED OR FELT
I CAN CARRY ENOUGH FOR TWO SAID SAM DEFIANTLY
CANT ANYTHING BE DONE MR BUTTERBUR ASKED FRODO CANT WE GET A COUPLE OF PONIES IN THE VILLAGE OR EVEN ONE JUST FOR THE BAGGAGE I DONT SUPPOSE WE COULD HIRE THEM BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY THEM HE ADDED DOUBTFULLY WONDERING IF HE COULD AFFORD IT
I DOUBT IT SAID THE LANDLORD UNHAPPILY THE TWO OR THREE RIDINGPONIES THAT THERE WERE IN BREE WERE STABLED IN MY YARD AND THEYRE GONE AS FOR OTHER ANIMALS HORSES OR PONIES FOR DRAUGHT OR WHAT NOT THERE ARE VERY FEW OF THEM IN BREE AND THEY WONT BE FOR SALE BUT ILL DO WHAT I CAN ILL ROUT OUT BOB AND SEND HIM ROUND AS SOON AS MAY BE
YES SAID STRIDER RELUCTANTLY YOU HAD BETTER DO THAT I AM AFRAID WE SHALL HAVE TO TRY TO GET ONE PONY AT LEAST BUT SO ENDS ALL HOPE OF STARTING EARLY AND SLIPPING AWAY QUIETLY WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BLOWN A HORN TO ANNOUNCE OUR DEPARTURE THAT WAS PART OF THEIR PLAN NO DOUBT
THERE IS ONE CRUMB OF COMFORT SAID MERRY AND MORE THAN A CRUMB I HOPE WE CAN HAVE BREAKFAST WHILE WE WAIT  AND SIT DOWN TO IT LETS GET HOLD OF NOB
IN THE END THERE WAS MORE THAN THREE HOURS DELAY BOB CAME BACK WITH THE REPORT THAT NO HORSE OR PONY WAS TO BE GOT FOR LOVE OR MONEY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD  EXCEPT ONE BILL FERNY HAD ONE THAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY SELL A POOR OLD HALFSTARVED CREATURE IT IS SAID BOB BUT HE WONT PART WITH IT FOR LESS THAN THRICE ITS WORTH SEEING HOW YOURE PLACED NOT IF I KNOWS BILL FERNY
BILL FERNY SAID FRODO ISNT THERE SOME TRICK WOULDNT THE BEAST BOLT BACK TO HIM WITH ALL OUR STUFF OR HELP IN TRACKING US OR SOMETHING
I WONDER SAID STRIDER BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY ANIMAL RUNNING HOME TO HIM ONCE IT GOT AWAY I FANCY THIS IS ONLY AN AFTERTHOUGHT OF KIND MASTER FERNYS JUST A WAY OF INCREASING HIS PROFITS FROM THE AFFAIR THE CHIEF DANGER IS THAT THE POOR BEAST IS PROBABLY AT DEATHS DOOR BUT THERE DOES NOT SEEM ANY CHOICE WHAT DOES HE WANT FOR IT
BILL FERNYS PRICE WAS TWELVE SILVER PENNIES AND THAT WAS INDEED AT LEAST THREE TIMES THE PONYS VALUE IN THOSE PARTS IT PROVED TO BE A BONY UNDERFED AND DISPIRITED ANIMAL BUT IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE DYING JUST YET MR BUTTERBUR PAID FOR IT HIMSELF AND OFFERED MERRY ANOTHER EIGHTEEN PENCE AS SOME COMPENSATION FOR THE LOST ANIMALS HE WAS AN HONEST MAN AND WELLOFF AS THINGS WERE RECKONED IN BREE BUT THIRTY SILVER PENNIES WAS A SORE BLOW TO HIM AND BEING CHEATED BY BILL FERNY MADE IT HARDER TO BEAR
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE CAME OUT ON THE RIGHT SIDE IN THE END IT TURNED OUT LATER THAT ONLY ONE HORSE HAD BEEN ACTUALLY STOLEN THE OTHERS HAD BEEN DRIVEN OFF OR HAD BOLTED IN TERROR AND WERE FOUND WANDERING IN DIFFERENT CORNERS OF THE BREELAND MERRYS PONIES HAD ESCAPED ALTOGETHER AND EVENTUALLY HAVING A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO THE DOWNS IN SEARCH OF FATTY LUMPKIN SO THEY CAME UNDER THE CARE OF TOM BOMBADIL FOR A WHILE AND WERE WELLOFF BUT WHEN NEWS OF THE EVENTS AT BREE CAME TO TOMS EARS HE SENT THEM TO MR BUTTERBUR WHO THUS GOT FIVE GOOD BEASTS AT A VERY FAIR PRICE THEY HAD TO WORK HARDER IN BREE BUT BOB TREATED THEM WELL SO ON THE WHOLE THEY WERE LUCKY THEY MISSED A DARK AND DANGEROUS JOURNEY BUT THEY NEVER CAME TO RIVENDELL
HOWEVER IN THE MEANWHILE FOR ALL MR BUTTERBUR KNEW HIS MONEY WAS GONE FOR GOOD OR FOR BAD AND HE HAD OTHER TROUBLES FOR THERE WAS A GREAT COMMOTION AS SOON AS THE REMAINING GUESTS WERE ASTIR AND HEARD NEWS OF THE RAID ON THE INN THE SOUTHERN TRAVELLERS HAD LOST SEVERAL HORSES AND BLAMED THE INNKEEPER LOUDLY UNTIL IT BECAME KNOWN THAT ONE OF THEIR OWN NUMBER HAD ALSO DISAPPEARED IN THE NIGHT NONE OTHER THAN BILL FERNYS SQUINTEYED COMPANION SUSPICION FELL ON HIM AT ONCE
IF YOU PICK UP WITH A HORSETHIEF AND BRING HIM TO MY HOUSE SAID BUTTERBUR ANGRILY YOU OUGHT TO PAY FOR ALL THE DAMAGE YOURSELVES AND NOT COME SHOUTING AT ME GO AND ASK FERNY WHERE YOUR HANDSOME FRIEND IS BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE WAS NOBODYS FRIEND AND NOBODY COULD RECOLLECT WHEN HE HAD JOINED THEIR PARTY
AFTER THEIR BREAKFAST THE HOBBITS HAD TO REPACK AND GET TOGETHER FURTHER SUPPLIES FOR THE LONGER JOURNEY THEY WERE NOW EXPECTING IT WAS CLOSE ON TEN OCLOCK BEFORE THEY AT LAST GOT OFF BY THAT TIME THE WHOLE OF BREE WAS BUZZING WITH EXCITEMENT FRODOS VANISHING TRICK THE APPEARANCE OF THE BLACK HORSEMEN THE ROBBING OF THE STABLES AND NOT LEAST THE NEWS THAT STRIDER THE RANGER HAD JOINED THE MYSTERIOUS HOBBITS MADE SUCH A TALE AS WOULD LAST FOR MANY UNEVENTFUL YEARS MOST OF THE INHABITANTS OF BREE AND STADDLE AND MANY EVEN FROM COMBE AND ARCHET WERE CROWDED IN THE ROAD TO SEE THE TRAVELLERS START THE OTHER GUESTS IN THE INN WERE AT THE DOORS OR HANGING OUT OF THE WINDOWS
STRIDER HAD CHANGED HIS MIND AND HE DECIDED TO LEAVE BREE BY THE MAIN ROAD ANY ATTEMPT TO SET OFF ACROSS COUNTRY AT ONCE WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE HALF THE INHABITANTS WOULD FOLLOW THEM TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE UP TO AND TO PREVENT THEM FROM TRESPASSING
THEY SAID FAREWELL TO NOB AND BOB AND TOOK LEAVE OF MR BUTTERBUR WITH MANY THANKS I HOPE WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SOME DAY WHEN THINGS ARE MERRY ONCE MORE SAID FRODO I SHOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO STAY IN YOUR HOUSE IN PEACE FOR A WHILE
THEY TRAMPED OFF ANXIOUS AND DOWNHEARTED UNDER THE EYES OF THE CROWD NOT ALL THE FACES WERE FRIENDLY NOR ALL THE WORDS THAT WERE SHOUTED BUT STRIDER SEEMED TO BE HELD IN AWE BY MOST OF THE BREELANDERS AND THOSE THAT HE STARED AT SHUT THEIR MOUTHS AND DREW AWAY HE WALKED IN FRONT WITH FRODO NEXT CAME MERRY AND PIPPIN AND LAST CAME SAM LEADING THE PONY WHICH WAS LADEN WITH AS MUCH OF THEIR BAGGAGE AS THEY HAD THE HEART TO GIVE IT BUT ALREADY IT LOOKED LESS DEJECTED AS IF IT APPROVED OF THE CHANGE IN ITS FORTUNES SAM WAS CHEWING AN APPLE THOUGHTFULLY HE HAD A POCKET FULL OF THEM A PARTING PRESENT FROM NOB AND BOB APPLES FOR WALKING AND A PIPE FOR SITTING HE SAID BUT I RECKON ILL MISS THEM BOTH BEFORE LONG
THE HOBBITS TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE INQUISITIVE HEADS THAT PEEPED OUT OF DOORS OR POPPED OVER WALLS AND FENCES AS THEY PASSED BUT AS THEY DREW NEAR TO THE FURTHER GATE FRODO SAW A DARK ILLKEPT HOUSE BEHIND A THICK HEDGE THE LAST HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SALLOW FACE WITH SLY SLANTING EYES BUT IT VANISHED AT ONCE
SO THATS WHERE THAT SOUTHERNER IS HIDING HE THOUGHT HE LOOKS MORE THAN HALF LIKE A GOBLIN
OVER THE HEDGE ANOTHER MAN WAS STARING BOLDLY HE HAD HEAVY BLACK BROWS AND DARK SCORNFUL EYES HIS LARGE MOUTH CURLED IN A SNEER HE WAS SMOKING A SHORT BLACK PIPE AS THEY APPROACHED HE TOOK IT OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND SPAT
MORNING LONGSHANKS HE SAID OFF EARLY FOUND SOME FRIENDS AT LAST STRIDER NODDED BUT DID NOT ANSWER MORNING MY LITTLE FRIENDS HE SAID TO THE OTHERS I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHO YOUVE TAKEN UP WITH THATS STICKATNAUGHT STRIDER THAT IS THOUGH IVE HEARD OTHER NAMES NOT SO PRETTY WATCH OUT TONIGHT AND YOU SAMMIE DONT GO ILLTREATING MY POOR OLD PONY PAH HE SPAT AGAIN
SAM TURNED QUICKLY AND YOU FERNY HE SAID PUT YOUR UGLY FACE OUT OF SIGHT OR IT WILL GET HURT WITH A SUDDEN FLICK QUICK AS LIGHTNING AN APPLE LEFT HIS HAND AND HIT BILL SQUARE ON THE NOSE HE DUCKED TOO LATE AND CURSES CAME FROM BEHIND THE HEDGE WASTE OF A GOOD APPLE SAID SAM REGRETFULLY AND STRODE ON
AT LAST THEY LEFT THE VILLAGE BEHIND THE ESCORT OF CHILDREN AND STRAGGLERS THAT HAD FOLLOWED THEM GOT TIRED AND TURNED BACK AT THE SOUTHGATE PASSING THROUGH THEY KEPT ON ALONG THE ROAD FOR SOME MILES IT BENT TO THE LEFT CURVING BACK INTO ITS EASTWARD LINE AS IT ROUNDED THE FEET OF BREEHILL AND THEN IT BEGAN TO RUN SWIFTLY DOWNWARDS INTO WOODED COUNTRY TO THEIR LEFT THEY COULD SEE SOME OF THE HOUSES AND HOBBITHOLES OF STADDLE ON THE GENTLER SOUTHEASTERN SLOPES OF THE HILL DOWN IN A DEEP HOLLOW AWAY NORTH OF THE ROAD THERE WERE WISPS OF RISING SMOKE THAT SHOWED WHERE COMBE LAY ARCHET WAS HIDDEN IN THE TREES BEYOND
AFTER THE ROAD HAD RUN DOWN SOME WAY AND HAD LEFT BREEHILL STANDING TALL AND BROWN BEHIND THEY CAME ON A NARROW TRACK THAT LED OFF TOWARDS THE NORTH THIS IS WHERE WE LEAVE THE OPEN AND TAKE TO COVER SAID STRIDER
NOT A SHORT CUT I HOPE SAID PIPPIN OUR LAST SHORT CUT THROUGH WOODS NEARLY ENDED IN DISASTER
AH BUT YOU HAD NOT GOT ME WITH YOU THEN LAUGHED STRIDER MY CUTS SHORT OR LONG DONT GO WRONG HE TOOK A LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT AND HE LED THE WAY QUICKLY DOWN TOWARDS THE WOODED VALLEY
HIS PLAN AS FAR AS THEY COULD UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT KNOWING THE COUNTRY WAS TO GO TOWARDS ARCHET AT FIRST BUT TO BEAR RIGHT AND PASS IT ON THE EAST AND THEN TO STEER AS STRAIGHT AS HE COULD OVER THE WILD LANDS TO WEATHERTOP HILL IN THAT WAY THEY WOULD IF ALL WENT WELL CUT OFF A GREAT LOOP OF THE ROAD WHICH FURTHER ON BENT SOUTHWARDS TO AVOID THE MIDGEWATER MARSHES BUT OF COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PASS THROUGH THE MARSHES THEMSELVES AND STRIDERS DESCRIPTION OF THEM WAS NOT ENCOURAGING
HOWEVER IN THE MEANWHILE WALKING WAS NOT UNPLEASANT INDEED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE DISTURBING EVENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY BETTER THAN ANY UP TO THAT TIME THE SUN WAS SHINING CLEAR BUT NOT TOO HOT THE WOODS IN THE VALLEY WERE STILL LEAFY AND FULL OF COLOUR AND SEEMED PEACEFUL AND WHOLESOME STRIDER GUIDED THEM CONFIDENTLY AMONG THE MANY CROSSING PATHS ALTHOUGH LEFT TO THEMSELVES THEY WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN AT A LOSS HE WAS TAKING A WANDERING COURSE WITH MANY TURNS AND DOUBLINGS TO PUT OFF ANY PURSUIT
BILL FERNY WILL HAVE WATCHED WHERE WE LEFT THE ROAD FOR CERTAIN HE SAID THOUGH I DONT THINK HE WILL FOLLOW US HIMSELF HE KNOWS THE LAND ROUND HERE WELL ENOUGH BUT HE KNOWS HE IS NOT A MATCH FOR ME IN A WOOD IT IS WHAT HE MAY TELL OTHERS THAT I AM AFRAID OF I DONT SUPPOSE THEY ARE FAR AWAY IF THEY THINK WE HAVE MADE FOR ARCHET SO MUCH THE BETTER
WHETHER BECAUSE OF STRIDERS SKILL OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON THEY SAW NO SIGN AND HEARD NO SOUND OF ANY OTHER LIVING THING ALL THAT DAY NEITHER TWOFOOTED EXCEPT BIRDS NOR FOURFOOTED EXCEPT ONE FOX AND A FEW SQUIRRELS THE NEXT DAY THEY BEGAN TO STEER A STEADY COURSE EASTWARDS AND STILL ALL WAS QUIET AND PEACEFUL ON THE THIRD DAY OUT FROM BREE THEY CAME OUT OF THE CHETWOOD THE LAND HAD BEEN FALLING STEADILY EVER SINCE THEY TURNED ASIDE FROM THE ROAD AND THEY NOW ENTERED A WIDE FLAT EXPANSE OF COUNTRY MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THEY WERE FAR BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THE BREELAND OUT IN THE PATHLESS WILDERNESS AND DRAWING NEAR TO THE MIDGEWATER MARSHES
THE GROUND NOW BECAME DAMP AND IN PLACES BOGGY AND HERE AND THERE THEY CAME UPON POOLS AND WIDE STRETCHES OF REEDS AND RUSHES FILLED WITH THE WARBLING OF LITTLE HIDDEN BIRDS THEY HAD TO PICK THEIR WAY CAREFULLY TO KEEP BOTH DRYFOOTED AND ON THEIR PROPER COURSE AT FIRST THEY MADE FARE PROGRESS BUT AS THEY WENT ON THEIR PASSAGE BECAME SLOWER AND MORE DANGEROUS THE MARSHES WERE BEWILDERING AND TREACHEROUS AND THERE WAS NO PERMANENT TRAIL EVEN FOR RANGERS TO FIND THROUGH THEIR SHIFTING QUAGMIRES THE FLIES BEGAN TO TORMENT THEM AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF CLOUDS OF TINY MIDGES THAT CREPT UP THEIR SLEEVES AND BREECHES AND INTO THEIR HAIR
I AM BEING EATEN ALIVE CRIED PIPPIN MIDGEWATER THERE ARE MORE MIDGES THAN WATER
WHAT DO THEY LIVE ON WHEN THEY CANT GET HOBBIT ASKED SAM SCRATCHING HIS NECK
THEY SPENT A MISERABLE DAY IN THIS LONELY AND UNPLEASANT COUNTRY THEIR CAMPINGPLACE WAS DAMP COLD AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BITING INSECTS WOULD NOT LET THEM SLEEP THERE WERE ALSO ABOMINABLE CREATURES HAUNTING THE REEDS AND TUSSOCKS THAT FROM THE SOUND OF THEM WERE EVIL RELATIVES OF THE CRICKET THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM AND THEY SQUEAKED ALL ROUND NEEKBREEK BREEKNEEK UNCEASINGLY ALL THE NIGHT UNTIL THE HOBBITS WERE NEARLY FRANTIC
THE NEXT DAY THE FOURTH WAS LITTLE BETTER AND THE NIGHT ALMOST AS COMFORTLESS THOUGH THE NEEKERBREEKERS AS SAM CALLED THEM HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND THE MIDGES STILL PURSUED THEM
AS FRODO LAY TIRED BUT UNABLE TO CLOSE HIS EYES IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT FAR AWAY THERE CAME A LIGHT IN THE EASTERN SKY IT FLASHED AND FADED MANY TIMES IT WAS NOT THE DAWN FOR THAT WAS STILL SOME HOURS OFF
WHAT IS THE LIGHT HE SAID TO STRIDER WHO HAD RISEN AND WAS STANDING GAZING AHEAD INTO THE NIGHT
I DO NOT KNOW STRIDER ANSWERED IT IS TOO DISTANT TO MAKE OUT IT IS LIKE LIGHTNING THAT LEAPS UP FROM THE HILLTOPS
FRODO LAY DOWN AGAIN BUT FOR A LONG WHILE HE COULD STILL SEE THE WHITE FLASHES AND AGAINST THEM THE TALL DARK FIGURE OF STRIDER STANDING SILENT AND WATCHFUL AT LAST HE PASSED INTO UNEASY SLEEP
THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR ON THE FIFTH DAY WHEN THEY LEFT THE LAST STRAGGLING POOLS AND REEDBEDS OF THE MARSHES BEHIND THEM THE LAND BEFORE THEM BEGAN STEADILY TO RISE AGAIN AWAY IN THE DISTANCE EASTWARD THEY COULD NOW SEE A LINE OF HILLS THE HIGHEST OF THEM WAS AT THE RIGHT OF THE LINE AND A LITTLE SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS IT HAD A CONICAL TOP SLIGHTLY FLATTENED AT THE SUMMIT
THAT IS WEATHERTOP SAID STRIDER THE OLD ROAD WHICH WE HAVE LEFT FAR AWAY ON OUR RIGHT RUNS TO THE SOUTH OF IT AND PASSES NOT FAR FROM ITS FOOT WE MIGHT REACH IT BY NOON TOMORROW IF WE GO STRAIGHT TOWARDS IT I SUPPOSE WE HAD BETTER DO SO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED FRODO
I MEAN WHEN WE DO GET THERE IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHAT WE SHALL FIND IT IS CLOSE TO THE ROAD
BUT SURELY WE WERE HOPING TO FIND GANDALF THERE
YES BUT THE HOPE IS FAINT IF HE COMES THIS WAY AT ALL HE MAY NOT PASS THROUGH BREE AND SO HE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING AND ANYWAY UNLESS BY LUCK WE ARRIVE ALMOST TOGETHER WE SHALL MISS ONE ANOTHER IT WILL NOT BE SAFE FOR HIM OR FOR US TO WAIT THERE LONG IF THE RIDERS FAIL TO FIND US IN THE WILDERNESS THEY ARE LIKELY TO MAKE FOR WEATHERTOP THEMSELVES IT COMMANDS A WIDE VIEW ALL ROUND INDEED THERE ARE MANY BIRDS AND BEASTS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT COULD SEE US AS WE STAND HERE FROM THAT HILLTOP NOT ALL THE BIRDS ARE TO BE TRUSTED AND THERE ARE OTHER SPIES MORE EVIL THAN THEY ARE
THE HOBBITS LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE DISTANT HILLS SAM LOOKED UP INTO THE PALE SKY FEARING TO SEE HAWKS OR EAGLES HOVERING OVER THEM WITH BRIGHT UNFRIENDLY EYES YOU DO MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND LONESOME STRIDER HE SAID
WHAT DO YOU ADVISE US TO DO ASKED FRODO
I THINK ANSWERED STRIDER SLOWLY AS IF HE WAS NOT QUITE SURE I THINK THE BEST THING IS TO GO AS STRAIGHT EASTWARD FROM HERE AS WE CAN TO MAKE FOR THE LINE OF HILLS NOT FOR WEATHERTOP THERE WE CAN STRIKE A PATH I KNOW THAT RUNS AT THEIR FEET IT WILL BRING US TO WEATHERTOP FROM THE NORTH AND LESS OPENLY THEN WE SHALL SEE WHAT WE SHALL SEE
ALL THAT DAY THEY PLODDED ALONG UNTIL THE COLD AND EARLY EVENING CAME DOWN THE LAND BECAME DRIER AND MORE BARREN BUT MISTS AND VAPOURS LAY BEHIND THEM ON THE MARSHES A FEW MELANCHOLY BIRDS WERE PIPING AND WAILING UNTIL THE ROUND RED SUN SANK SLOWLY INTO THE WESTERN SHADOWS THEN AN EMPTY SILENCE FELL THE HOBBITS THOUGHT OF THE SOFT LIGHT OF SUNSET GLANCING THROUGH THE CHEERFUL WINDOWS OF BAG END FAR AWAY
AT THE DAYS END THEY CAME TO A STREAM THAT WANDERED DOWN FROM THE HILLS TO LOSE ITSELF IN THE STAGNANT MARSHLAND AND THEY WENT UP ALONG ITS BANKS WHILE THE LIGHT LASTED IT WAS ALREADY NIGHT WHEN AT LAST THEY HALTED AND MADE THEIR CAMP UNDER SOME STUNTED ALDERTREES BY THE SHORES OF THE STREAM AHEAD THERE LOOMED NOW AGAINST THE DUSKY SKY THE BLEAK AND TREELESS BACKS OF THE HILLS THAT NIGHT THEY SET A WATCH AND STRIDER IT SEEMED DID NOT SLEEP AT ALL THE MOON WAS WAXING AND IN THE EARLY NIGHTHOURS A COLD GREY LIGHT LAY ON THE LAND
NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT AGAIN SOON AFTER SUNRISE THERE WAS A FROST IN THE AIR AND THE SKY WAS A PALE CLEAR BLUE THE HOBBITS FELT REFRESHED AS IF THEY HAD HAD A NIGHT OF UNBROKEN SLEEP ALREADY THEY WERE GETTING USED TO MUCH WALKING ON SHORT COMMONS  SHORTER AT ANY RATE THAN WHAT IN THE SHIRE THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BARELY ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM ON THEIR LEGS PIPPIN DECLARED THAT FRODO WAS LOOKING TWICE THE HOBBIT THAT HE HAD BEEN
VERY ODD SAID FRODO TIGHTENING HIS BELT CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A GOOD DEAL LESS OF ME I HOPE THE THINNING PROCESS WILL NOT GO ON INDEFINITELY OR I SHALL BECOME A WRAITH
DO NOT SPEAK OF SUCH THINGS SAID STRIDER QUICKLY AND WITH SURPRISING EARNESTNESS
THE HILLS DREW NEARER THEY MADE AN UNDULATING RIDGE OFTEN RISING ALMOST TO A THOUSAND FEET AND HERE AND THERE FALLING AGAIN TO LOW CLEFTS OR PASSES LEADING INTO THE EASTERN LAND BEYOND ALONG THE CREST OF THE RIDGE THE HOBBITS COULD SEE WHAT LOOKED TO BE THE REMAINS OF GREENGROWN WALLS AND DIKES AND IN THE CLEFTS THERE STILL STOOD THE RUINS OF OLD WORKS OF STONE BY NIGHT THEY HAD REACHED THE FEET OF THE WESTWARD SLOPES AND THERE THEY CAMPED IT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER AND THEY WERE SIX DAYS OUT FROM BREE
IN THE MORNING THEY FOUND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THE CHETWOOD A TRACK PLAIN TO SEE THEY TURNED RIGHT AND FOLLOWED IT SOUTHWARDS IT RAN CUNNINGLY TAKING A LINE THAT SEEMED CHOSEN SO AS TO KEEP AS MUCH HIDDEN AS POSSIBLE FROM THE VIEW BOTH OF THE HILLTOPS ABOVE AND OF THE FLATS TO THE WEST IT DIVED INTO DELLS AND HUGGED STEEP BANKS AND WHERE IT PASSED OVER FLATTER AND MORE OPEN GROUND ON EITHER SIDE OF IT THERE WERE LINES OF LARGE BOULDERS AND HEWN STONES THAT SCREENED THE TRAVELLERS ALMOST LIKE A HEDGE
I WONDER WHO MADE THIS PATH AND WHAT FOR SAID MERRY AS THEY WALKED ALONG ONE OF THESE AVENUES WHERE THE STONES WERE UNUSUALLY LARGE AND CLOSELY SET I AM NOT SURE THAT I LIKE IT IT HAS A  WELL RATHER A BARROWWIGHTISH LOOK IS THERE ANY BARROW ON WEATHERTOP
NO THERE IS NO BARROW ON WEATHERTOP NOR ON ANY OF THESE HILLS ANSWERED STRIDER THE MEN OF THE WEST DID NOT LIVE HERE THOUGH IN THEIR LATTER DAYS THEY DEFENDED THE HILLS FOR A WHILE AGAINST THE EVIL THAT CAME OUT OF ANGMAR THIS PATH WAS MADE TO SERVE THE FORTS ALONG THE WALLS BUT LONG BEFORE IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE NORTH KINGDOM THEY BUILT A GREAT WATCHTOWER ON WEATHERTOP AMON SUL THEY CALLED IT IT WAS BURNED AND BROKEN AND NOTHING REMAINS OF IT NOW BUT A TUMBLED RING LIKE A ROUGH CROWN ON THE OLD HILLS HEAD YET ONCE IT WAS TALL AND FAIR IT IS TOLD THAT ELENDIL STOOD THERE WATCHING FOR THE COMING OF GILGALAD OUT OF THE WEST IN THE DAYS OF THE LAST ALLIANCE
THE HOBBITS GAZED AT STRIDER IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS LEARNED IN OLD LORE AS WELL AS IN THE WAYS OF THE WILD WHO WAS GILGALAD ASKED MERRY BUT STRIDER DID NOT ANSWER AND SEEMED TO BE LOST IN THOUGHT SUDDENLY A LOW VOICE MURMURED
GILGALAD WAS AN ELVENKING
OF HIM THE HARPERS SADLY SING
THE LAST WHOSE REALM WAS FAIR AND FREE
BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA

HIS SWORD WAS LONG HIS LANCE WAS KEEN
HIS SHINING HELM AFAR WAS SEEN
THE COUNTLESS STARS OF HEAVENS FIELD
WERE MIRRORED IN HIS SILVER SHIELD

BUT LONG AGO HE RODE AWAY
AND WHERE HE DWELLETH NONE CAN SAY
FOR INTO DARKNESS FELL HIS STAR
IN MORDOR WHERE THE SHADOWS ARE

THE OTHERS TURNED IN AMAZEMENT FOR THE VOICE WAS SAMS
DONT STOP SAID MERRY
THATS ALL I KNOW STAMMERED SAM BLUSHING I LEARNED IT FROM MR BILBO WHEN I WAS A LAD HE USED TO TELL ME TALES LIKE THAT KNOWING HOW I WAS ALWAYS ONE FOR HEARING ABOUT ELVES IT WAS MR BILBO AS TAUGHT ME MY LETTERS HE WAS MIGHTY BOOKLEARNED WAS DEAR OLD MR BILBO AND HE WROTE POETRY HE WROTE WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID
HE DID NOT MAKE IT UP SAID STRIDER IT IS PART OF THE LAY THAT IS CALLED THE FALL OF GILGALAD WHICH IS IN AN ANCIENT TONGUE BILBO MUST HAVE TRANSLATED IT I NEVER KNEW THAT
THERE WAS A LOT MORE SAID SAM ALL ABOUT MORDOR I DIDNT LEARN THAT PART IT GAVE ME THE SHIVERS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD BE GOING THAT WAY MYSELF
GOING TO MORDOR CRIED PIPPIN I HOPE IT WONT COME TO THAT
DO NOT SPEAK THAT NAME SO LOUDLY SAID STRIDER
IT WAS ALREADY MIDDAY WHEN THEY DREW NEAR THE SOUTHERN END OF THE PATH AND SAW BEFORE THEM IN THE PALE CLEAR LIGHT OF THE OCTOBER SUN A GREYGREEN BANK LEADING UP LIKE A BRIDGE ON TO THE NORTHWARD SLOPE OF THE HILL THEY DECIDED TO MAKE FOR THE TOP AT ONCE WHILE THE DAYLIGHT WAS BROAD CONCEALMENT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE AND THEY COULD ONLY HOPE THAT NO ENEMY OR SPY WAS OBSERVING THEM NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN MOVING ON THE HILL IF GANDALF WAS ANYWHERE ABOUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM
ON THE WESTERN FLANK OF WEATHERTOP THEY FOUND A SHELTERED HOLLOW AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH THERE WAS A BOWLSHAPED DELL WITH GRASSY SIDES THERE THEY LEFT SAM AND PIPPIN WITH THE PONY AND THEIR PACKS AND LUGGAGE THE OTHER THREE WENT ON AFTER HALF AN HOURS PLODDING CLIMB STRIDER REACHED THE CROWN OF THE HILL FRODO AND MERRY FOLLOWED TIRED AND BREATHLESS THE LAST SLOPE HAD BEEN STEEP AND ROCKY
ON THE TOP THEY FOUND AS STRIDER HAD SAID A WIDE RING OF ANCIENT STONEWORK NOW CRUMBLING OR COVERED WITH AGELONG GRASS BUT IN THE CENTRE A CAIRN OF BROKEN STONES HAD BEEN PILED THEY WERE BLACKENED AS IF WITH FIRE ABOUT THEM THE TURF WAS BURNED TO THE ROOTS AND ALL WITHIN THE RING THE GRASS WAS SCORCHED AND SHRIVELLED AS IF FLAMES HAD SWEPT THE HILLTOP BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY LIVING THING
STANDING UPON THE RIM OF THE RUINED CIRCLE THEY SAW ALL ROUND BELOW THEM A WIDE PROSPECT FOR THE MOST PART OF LANDS EMPTY AND FEATURELESS EXCEPT FOR PATCHES OF WOODLAND AWAY TO THE SOUTH BEYOND WHICH THEY CAUGHT HERE AND THERE THE GLINT OF DISTANT WATER BENEATH THEM ON THIS SOUTHERN SIDE THERE RAN LIKE A RIBBON THE OLD ROAD COMING OUT OF THE WEST AND WINDING UP AND DOWN UNTIL IT FADED BEHIND A RIDGE OF DARK LAND TO THE EAST NOTHING WAS MOVING ON IT FOLLOWING ITS LINE EASTWARD WITH THEIR EYES THEY SAW THE MOUNTAINS THE NEARER FOOTHILLS WERE BROWN AND SOMBRE BEHIND THEM STOOD TALLER SHAPES OF GREY AND BEHIND THOSE AGAIN WERE HIGH WHITE PEAKS GLIMMERING AMONG THE CLOUDS
WELL HERE WE ARE SAID MERRY AND VERY CHEERLESS AND UNINVITING IT LOOKS THERE IS NO WATER AND NO SHELTER AND NO SIGN OF GANDALF BUT I DONT BLAME HIM FOR NOT WAITING  IF HE EVER CAME HERE
I WONDER SAID STRIDER LOOKING ROUND THOUGHTFULLY EVEN IF HE WAS A DAY OR TWO BEHIND US AT BREE HE COULD HAVE ARRIVED HERE FIRST HE CAN RIDE VERY SWIFTLY WHEN NEED PRESSES SUDDENLY HE STOOPED AND LOOKED AT THE STONE ON THE TOP OF THE CAIRN IT WAS FLATTER THAN THE OTHERS AND WHITER AS IF IT HAD ESCAPED THE FIRE HE PICKED IT UP AND EXAMINED IT TURNING IT IN HIS FINGERS THIS HAS BEEN HANDLED RECENTLY HE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE MARKS
ON THE FLAT UNDERSIDE FRODO SAW SOME SCRATCHES 
THERE SEEMS TO HE A STROKE A DOT AND THREE MORE STROKES HE SAID
THE STROKE ON THE LEFT MIGHT BE A GRUNE WITH THIN BRANCHES SAID STRIDER IT MIGHT BE A SIGN LEFT BY GANDALF THOUGH ONE CANNOT BE SURE THE SCRATCHES ARE FINE AND THEY CERTAINLY LOOK FRESH BUT THE MARKS MIGHT MEAN SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH US RANGERS USE RUNES AND THEY COME HERE SOMETIMES
WHAT COULD THEY MEAN EVEN IF GANDALF MADE THEM ASKED MERRY
I SHOULD SAY ANSWERED STRIDER THAT THEY STOOD FOR G3 AND WERE A SIGN THAT GANDALF WAS HERE ON OCTOBER THE THIRD THAT IS THREE DAYS AGO NOW IT WOULD ALSO SHOW THAT HE WAS IN A HURRY AND DANGER WAS AT HAND SO THAT HE HAD NO TIME OR DID NOT DARE TO WRITE ANYTHING LONGER OR PLAINER IF THAT IS SO WE MUST BE WARY
I WISH WE COULD FEEL SURE THAT HE MADE THE MARKS WHATEVER THEY MAY MEAN SAID FRODO IT WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO KNOW THAT HE WAS ON THE WAY IN FRONT OF US OR BEHIND US
PERHAPS SAID STRIDER FOR MYSELF I BELIEVE THAT HE WAS HERE AND WAS IN DANGER THERE HAVE BEEN SCORCHING FLAMES HERE AND NOW THE LIGHT THAT WE SAW THREE NIGHTS AGO IN THE EASTERN SKY COMES BACK TO MY MIND I GUESS THAT HE WAS ATTACKED ON THIS HILLTOP BUT WITH WHAT RESULT I CANNOT TELL HE IS HERE NO LONGER AND WE MUST NOW LOOK AFTER OURSELVES AND MAKE OUR OWN WAY TO RIVENDELL AS BEST WE CAN
HOW FAR IS RIVENDELL ASKED MERRY GAZING ROUND WEARILY THE WORLD LOOKED WILD AND WIDE FROM WEATHERTOP
I DONT KNOW IF THE ROAD HAS EVER BEEN MEASURED IN MILES BEYOND THE FORSAKEN INN A DAYS JOURNEY EAST OF BREE ANSWERED STRIDER SOME SAY IT IS SO FAR AND SOME SAY OTHERWISE IT IS A STRANGE ROAD AND FOLK ARE GLAD TO REACH THEIR JOURNEYS END WHETHER THE TIME IS LONG OR SHORT BUT I KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE ME ON MY OWN FEET WITH FAIR WEATHER AND NO ILL FORTUNE TWELVE DAYS FROM HERE TO THE FORD OF BRUINEN WHERE THE ROAD CROSSES THE LOUDWATER THAT RUNS OUT OF RIVENDELL WE HAVE AT LEAST A FORTNIGHTS JOURNEY BEFORE US FOR I DO NOT THINK WE SHALL BE ABLE TO USE THE ROAD
A FORTNIGHT SAID FRODO A LOT MAY HAPPEN IN THAT TIME
IT MAY SAID STRIDER
THEY STOOD FOR A WHILE SILENT ON THE HILLTOP NEAR ITS SOUTHWARD EDGE IN THAT LONELY PLACE FRODO FOR THE FIRST TIME FULLY REALIZED HIS HOMELESSNESS AND DANGER HE WISHED BITTERLY THAT HIS FORTUNE HAD LEFT HIM IN THE QUIET AND BELOVED SHIRE HE STARED DOWN AT THE HATEFUL ROAD LEADING BACK WESTWARD  TO HIS HOME SUDDENLY HE WAS AWARE THAT TWO BLACK SPECKS WERE MOVING SLOWLY ALONG IT GOING WESTWARD AND LOOKING AGAIN HE SAW THAT THREE OTHERS WERE CREEPING EASTWARD TO MEET THEM HE GAVE A CRY AND CLUTCHED STRIDERS ARM
LOOK HE SAID POINTING DOWNWARDS
AT ONCE STRIDER FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE GROUND BEHIND THE RUINED CIRCLE PULLING FRODO DOWN BESIDE HIM MERRY THREW HIMSELF ALONGSIDE
WHAT IS IT HE WHISPERED
I DO NOT KNOW BUT I FEAR THE WORST ANSWERED STRIDER
SLOWLY THEY CRAWLED UP TO THE EDGE OF THE RING AGAIN AND PEERED THROUGH A CLEFT BETWEEN TWO JAGGED STONES THE LIGHT WAS NO LONGER BRIGHT FOR THE CLEAR MORNING HAD FADED AND CLOUDS CREEPING OUT OF THE EAST HAD NOW OVERTAKEN THE SUN AS IT BEGAN TO GO DOWN THEY COULD ALL SEE THE BLACK SPECKS BUT NEITHER FRODO NOR MERRY COULD MAKE OUT THEIR SHAPES FOR CERTAIN YET SOMETHING TOLD THEM THAT THERE FAR BELOW WERE BLACK RIDERS ASSEMBLING ON THE ROAD BEYOND THE FOOT OF THE HILL
YES SAID STRIDER WHOSE KEENER SIGHT LEFT HIM IN NO DOUBT THE ENEMY IS HERE
HASTILY THEY CREPT AWAY AND SLIPPED DOWN THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HILL TO FIND THEIR COMPANIONS
SAM AND PEREGRIN HAD NOT BEEN IDLE THEY HAD EXPLORED THE SMALL DELL AND THE SURROUNDING SLOPES NOT FAR AWAY THEY FOUND A SPRING OF CLEAR WATER IN THE HILLSIDE AND NEAR IT FOOTPRINTS NOT MORE THAN A DAY OR TWO OLD IN THE DELL ITSELF THEY FOUND RECENT TRACES OF A FIRE AND OTHER SIGNS OF A HASTY CAMP THERE WERE SOME FALLEN ROCKS ON THE EDGE OF THE DELL NEAREST TO THE HILL BEHIND THEM SAM CAME UPON A SMALL STORE OF FIREWOOD NEATLY STACKED
I WONDER IF OLD GANDALF HAS BEEN HERE HE SAID TO PIPPIN WHOEVER IT WAS PUT THIS STUFF HERE MEANT TO COME BACK IT SEEMS
STRIDER WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THESE DISCOVERIES I WISH I HAD WAITED AND EXPLORED THE GROUND DOWN HERE MYSELF HE SAID HURRYING OFF TO THE SPRING TO EXAMINE THE FOOTPRINTS
IT IS JUST AS I FEARED HE SAID WHEN HE CAME BACK SAM AND PIPPIN HAVE TRAMPLED THE SOFT GROUND AND THE MARKS ARE SPOILT OR CONFUSED RANGERS HAVE BEEN HERE LATELY IT IS THEY WHO LEFT THE FIREWOOD BEHIND BUT THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL NEWER TRACKS THAT WERE NOT MADE BY RANGERS AT LEAST ONE SET WAS MADE ONLY A DAY OR TWO AGO BY HEAVY BOOTS AT LEAST ONE I CANNOT NOW BE CERTAIN BUT I THINK THERE WERE MANY BOOTED FEET HE PAUSED AND STOOD IN ANXIOUS THOUGHT
EACH OF THE HOBBITS SAW IN HIS MIND A VISION OF THE CLOAKED AND BOOTED RIDERS IF THE HORSEMEN HAD ALREADY FOUND THE DELL THE SOONER STRIDER LED THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BETTER SAM VIEWED THE HOLLOW WITH GREAT DISLIKE NOW THAT HE HAD HEARD NEWS OF THEIR ENEMIES ON THE ROAD ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY
HADNT WE BETTER CLEAR OUT QUICK MR STRIDER HE ASKED IMPATIENTLY IT IS GETTING LATE AND I DONT LIKE THIS HOLE IT MAKES MY HEART SINK SOMEHOW
YES WE CERTAINLY MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO AT ONCE ANSWERED STRIDER LOOKING UP AND CONSIDERING THE TIME AND THE WEATHER WELL SAM HE SAID AT LAST I DO NOT LIKE THIS PLACE EITHER BUT I CANNOT THINK OF ANYWHERE BETTER THAT WE COULD REACH BEFORE NIGHTFALL AT LEAST WE ARE OUT OF SIGHT FOR THE MOMENT AND IF WE MOVED WE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE SEEN BY SPIES ALL WE COULD DO WOULD BE TO GO RIGHT OUT OF OUR WAY BACK NORTH ON THIS SIDE OF THE LINE OF HILLS WHERE THE LAND IS ALL MUCH THE SAME AS IT IS HERE THE ROAD IS WATCHED BUT WE SHOULD HAVE TO CROSS IT IF WE TRIED TO TAKE COVER IN THE THICKETS AWAY TO THE SOUTH ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ROAD BEYOND THE HILLS THE COUNTRY IS BARE AND FLAT FOR MILES
CAN THE RIDERS SEE ASKED MERRY I MEAN THEY SEEM USUALLY TO HAVE USED THEIR NOSES RATHER THAN THEIR EYES SMELLING FOR US IF SMELLING IS THE RIGHT WORD AT LEAST IN THE DAYLIGHT BUT YOU MADE US LIE DOWN FLAT WHEN YOU SAW THEM DOWN BELOW AND NOW YOU TALK OF BEING SEEN IF WE MOVE
I WAS TOO CARELESS ON THE HILLTOP ANSWERED STRIDER I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO FIND SOME SIGN OF GANDALF BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THREE OF US TO GO UP AND STAND THERE SO LONG FOR THE BLACK HORSES CAN SEE AND THE RIDERS CAN USE MEN AND OTHER CREATURES AS SPIES AS WE FOUND AT BREE THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT SEE THE WORLD OF LIGHT AS WE DO BUT OUR SHAPES CAST SHADOWS IN THEIR MINDS WHICH ONLY THE NOON SUN DESTROYS AND IN THE DARK THEY PERCEIVE MANY SIGNS AND FORMS THAT ARE HIDDEN FROM US THEN THEY ARE MOST TO BE FEARED AND AT ALL TIMES THEY SMELL THE BLOOD OF LIVING THINGS DESIRING AND HATING IT SENSES TOO THERE ARE OTHER THAN SIGHT OR SMELL WE CAN FEEL THEIR PRESENCE  IT TROUBLED OUR HEARTS AS SOON AS WE CAME HERE AND BEFORE WE SAW THEM THEY FEEL OURS MORE KEENLY ALSO HE ADDED AND HIS VOICE SANK TO A WHISPER THE RING DRAWS THEM
IS THERE NO ESCAPE THEN SAID FRODO LOOKING ROUND WILDLY IF I MOVE I SHALL BE SEEN AND HUNTED IF I STAY I SHALL DRAW THEM TO ME
STRIDER LAID HIS HAND ON HIS SHOULDER THERE IS STILL HOPE HE SAID YOU ARE NOT ALONE LET US TAKE THIS WOOD THAT IS SET READY FOR THE FIRE AS A SIGN THERE IS LITTLE SHELTER OR DEFENCE HERE BUT FIRE SHALL SERVE FOR BOTH SAURON CAN PUT FIRE TO HIS EVIL USES AS HE CAN ALL THINGS BUT THESE RIDERS DO NOT LOVE IT AND FEAR THOSE WHO WIELD IT FIRE IS OUR FRIEND IN THE WILDERNESS
MAYBE MUTTERED SAM IT IS ALSO AS GOOD A WAY OF SAYING HERE WE ARE AS I CAN THINK OF BAR SHOUTING
DOWN IN THE LOWEST AND MOST SHELTERED CORNER OF THE DELL THEY LIT A FIRE AND PREPARED A MEAL THE SHADES OF EVENING BEGAN TO FALL AND IT GREW COLD THEY WERE SUDDENLY AWARE OF GREAT HUNGER FOR THEY HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING SINCE BREAKFAST BUT THEY DARED NOT MAKE MORE THAN A FRUGAL SUPPER THE LANDS AHEAD WERE EMPTY OF ALL SAVE BIRDS AND BEASTS UNFRIENDLY PLACES DESERTED BY ALL THE RACES OF THE WORLD RANGERS PASSED AT TIMES BEYOND THE HILLS BUT THEY WERE FEW AND DID NOT STAY OTHER WANDERERS WERE RARE AND OF EVIL SORT TROLLS MIGHT STRAY DOWN AT TIMES OUT OF THE NORTHERN VALLEYS OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS ONLY ON THE ROAD WOULD TRAVELLERS BE FOUND MOST OFTEN DWARVES HURRYING ALONG ON BUSINESS OF THEIR OWN AND WITH NO HELP AND FEW WORDS TO SPARE FOR STRANGERS
I DONT SEE HOW OUR FOOD CAN BE MADE TO LAST SAID FRODO WE HAVE BEEN CAREFUL ENOUGH IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND THIS SUPPER IS NO FEAST BUT WE HAVE USED MORE THAN WE OUGHT IF WE HAVE TWO WEEKS STILL TO GO AND PERHAPS MORE
THERE IS FOOD IN THE WILD SAID STRIDER BERRY ROOT AND HERB AND I HAVE SOME SKILL AS A HUNTER AT NEED YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF STARVING BEFORE WINTER COMES BUT GATHERING AND CATCHING FOOD IS LONG AND WEARY WORK AND WE NEED HASTE SO TIGHTEN YOUR BELTS AND THINK WITH HOPE OF THE TABLES OF ELRONDS HOUSE
THE COLD INCREASED AS DARKNESS CAME ON PEERING OUT FROM THE EDGE OF THE DELL THEY COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A GREY LAND NOW VANISHING QUICKLY INTO SHADOW THE SKY ABOVE HAD CLEARED AGAIN AND WAS SLOWLY FILLED WITH TWINKLING STARS FRODO AND HIS COMPANIONS HUDDLED ROUND THE FIRE WRAPPED IN EVERY GARMENT AND BLANKET THEY POSSESSED BUT STRIDER WAS CONTENT WITH A SINGLE CLOAK AND SAT A LITTLE APART DRAWING THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS PIPE
AS NIGHT FELL AND THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE BEGAN TO SHINE OUT BRIGHTLY HE BEGAN TO TELL THEM TALES TO KEEP THEIR MINDS FROM FEAR HE KNEW MANY HISTORIES AND LEGENDS OF LONG AGO OF ELVES AND MEN AND THE GOOD AND EVIL DEEDS OF THE ELDER DAYS THEY WONDERED HOW OLD HE WAS AND WHERE HE HAD LEARNED ALL THIS LORE
TELL US OF GILGALAD SAID MERRY SUDDENLY WHEN HE PAUSED AT THE END OF A STORY OF THE ELFKINGDOMS DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE OF THAT OLD LAY THAT YOU SPOKE OF
I DO INDEED ANSWERED STRIDER SO ALSO DOES FRODO FOR IT CONCERNS US CLOSELY MERRY AND PIPPIN LOOKED AT FRODO WHO WAS STARING INTO THE FIRE
I KNOW ONLY THE LITTLE THAT GANDALF HAS TOLD ME SAID FRODO SLOWLY GILGALAD WAS THE LAST OF THE GREAT ELFKINGS OF MIDDLEEARTH GILGALAD IS STARLIGHT IN THEIR TONGUE WITH ELENDIL THE ELFFRIEND HE WENT TO THE LAND OF
NO SAID STRIDER INTERRUPTING I DO NOT THINK THAT TALE SHOULD BE TOLD NOW WITH THE SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY AT HAND IF WE WIN THROUGH TO THE HOUSE OF ELROND YOU MAY HEAR IT THERE TOLD IN FULL
THEN TELL US SOME OTHER TALE OF THE OLD DAYS BEGGED SAM A TALE ABOUT THE ELVES BEFORE THE FADING TIME I WOULD DEARLY LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT ELVES THE DARK SEEMS TO PRESS ROUND SO CLOSE
I WILL TELL YOU THE TALE OF TINUVIEL SAID STRIDER IN BRIEF  FOR IT IS A LONG TALE OF WHICH THE END IS NOT KNOWN AND THERE ARE NONE NOW EXCEPT ELROND THAT REMEMBER IT ARIGHT AS IT WAS TOLD OF OLD IT IS A FAIR TALE THOUGH IT IS SAD AS ARE ALL THE TALES OF MIDDLEEARTH AND YET IT MAY LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS HE WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME AND THEN HE BEGAN NOT TO SPEAK BUT TO CHANT SOFTLY
THE LEAVES WERE LONG THE GRASS WAS GREEN
THE HEMLOCKUMBELS TALL AND FAIR
AND IN THE GLADE A LIGHT WAS SEEN
OF STARS IN SHADOW SHIMMERING
TINUVIEL WAS DANCING THERE
TO MUSIC OF A PIPE UNSEEN
AND LIGHT OF STARS WAS IN HER HAIR
AND IN HER RAIMENT GLIMMERING

THERE BEREN CAME FROM MOUNTAINS COLD
AND LOST HE WANDERED UNDER LEAVES
AND WHERE THE ELVENRIVER ROLLED
HE WALKED ALONE AND SORROWING
HE PEERED BETWEEN THE HEMLOCKLEAVES
AND SAW IN WANDER FLOWERS OF GOLD
UPON HER MANTLE AND HER SLEEVES
AND HER HAIR LIKE SHADOW FOLLOWING

ENCHANTMENT HEALED HIS WEARY FEET
THAT OVER HILLS WERE DOOMED TO ROAM
AND FORTH HE HASTENED STRONG AND FLEET
AND GRASPED AT MOONBEAMS GLISTENING
THROUGH WOVEN WOODS IN ELVENHOME
SHE TIGHTLY FLED ON DANCING FEET
AND LEFT HIM LONELY STILL TO ROAM
IN THE SILENT FOREST LISTENING

HE HEARD THERE OFT THE FLYING SOUND
OF FEET AS LIGHT AS LINDENLEAVES
OR MUSIC WELLING UNDERGROUND
IN HIDDEN HOLLOWS QUAVERING
NOW WITHERED LAY THE HEMLOCKSHEAVES
AND ONE BY ONE WITH SIGHING SOUND
WHISPERING FELL THE BEECHEN LEAVES
IN THE WINTRY WOODLAND WAVERING

HE SOUGHT HER EVER WANDERING FAR
WHERE LEAVES OF YEARS WERE THICKLY STREWN
BY LIGHT OF MOON AND RAY OF STAR
IN FROSTY HEAVENS SHIVERING
HER MANTLE GLINTED IN THE MOON
AS ON A HILLTOP HIGH AND FAR
SHE DANCED AND AT HER FEET WAS STREWN
A MIST OF SILVER QUIVERING

WHEN WINTER PASSED SHE CAME AGAIN
AND HER SONG RELEASED THE SUDDEN SPRING
LIKE RISING LARK AND FALLING RAIN
AND MELTING WATER BUBBLING
HE SAW THE ELVENFLOWERS SPRING
ABOUT HER FEET AND HEALED AGAIN
HE LONGED BY HER TO DANCE AND SING
UPON THE GRASS UNTROUBLING

AGAIN SHE FLED BUT SWIFT HE CAME
TINUVIEL TINUVIEL
HE CALLED HER BY HER ELVISH NAME
AND THERE SHE HALTED LISTENING
ONE MOMENT STOOD SHE AND A SPELL
HIS VOICE LAID ON HER BEREN CAME
AND DOOM FELL ON TINUVIEL
THAT IN HIS ARMS LAY GLISTENING

AS BEREN LOOKED INTO HER EYES
WITHIN THE SHADOWS OF HER HAIR
THE TREMBLING STARLIGHT OF THE SKIES
HE SAW THERE MIRRORED SHIMMERING
TINUVIEL THE ELVENFAIR
IMMORTAL MAIDEN ELVENWISE
ABOUT HIM CAST HER SHADOWY HAIR
AND ARMS LIKE SILVER GLIMMERING

LONG WAS THE WAY THAT FATE THEM BORE
OER STONY MOUNTAINS COLD AND GREY
THROUGH HALLS OF IRON AND DARKLING DOOR
AND WOODS OF NIGHTSHADE MORROWLESS
THE SUNDERING SEAS BETWEEN THEM LAY
AND YET AT LAST THEY MET ONCE MORE
AND LONG AGO THEY PASSED AWAY
IN THE FOREST SINGING SORROWLESS


STRIDER SIGHED AND PAUSED BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN THAT IS A SONG HE SAID IN THE MODE THAT IS CALLED ANNTHENNATH AMONG THE ELVES BUT IS HARD TO RENDER IN OUR COMMON SPEECH AND THIS IS BUT A ROUGH ECHO OF IT IT TELLS OF THE MEETING OF BEREN SON OF BARAHIR AND LUTHIEN TINUVIEL BEREN WAS A MORTAL MAN BUT LUTHIEN WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THINGOL A KING OF ELVES UPON MIDDLEEARTH WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG AND SHE WAS THE FAIREST MAIDEN THAT HAS EVER BEEN AMONG ALL THE CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD AS THE STARS ABOVE THE MISTS OF THE NORTHERN LANDS WAS HER LOVELINESS AND IN HER FACE WAS A SHINING LIGHT IN THOSE DAYS THE GREAT ENEMY OF WHOM SAURON OF MORDOR WAS BUT A SERVANT DWELT IN ANGBAND IN THE NORTH AND THE ELVES OF THE WEST COMING BACK TO MIDDLEEARTH MADE WAR UPON HIM TO REGAIN THE SILMARILS WHICH HE HAD STOLEN AND THE FATHERS OF MEN AIDED THE ELVES BUT THE ENEMY WAS VICTORIOUS AND BARAHIR WAS SLAIN AND BEREN ESCAPING THROUGH GREAT PERIL CAME OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF TERROR INTO THE HIDDEN KINGDOM OF THINGOL IN THE FOREST OF NELDORETH THERE HE BEHELD LUTHIEN SINGING AND DANCING IN A GLADE BESIDE THE ENCHANTED RIVER ESGALDUIN AND HE NAMED HER TINUVIEL THAT IS NIGHTINGALE IN THE LANGUAGE OF OLD MANY SORROWS BEFELL THEM AFTERWARDS AND THEY WERE PARTED LONG TINUVIEL RESCUED BEREN FROM THE DUNGEONS OF SAURON AND TOGETHER THEY PASSED THROUGH GREAT DANGERS AND CAST DOWN EVEN THE GREAT ENEMY FROM HIS THRONE AND TOOK FROM HIS IRON CROWN ONE OF THE THREE SILMARILS BRIGHTEST OF ALL JEWELS TO BE THE BRIDEPRICE OF LUTHIEN TO THINGOL HER FATHER YET AT THE LAST BEREN WAS SLAIN BY THE WOLF THAT CAME FROM THE GATES OF ANGBAND AND HE DIED IN THE ARMS OF TINUVIEL BUT SHE CHOSE MORTALITY AND TO DIE FROM THE WORLD SO THAT SHE MIGHT FOLLOW HIM AND IT IS SUNG THAT THEY MET AGAIN BEYOND THE SUNDERING SEAS AND AFTER A BRIEF TIME WALKING ALIVE ONCE MORE IN THE GREEN WOODS TOGETHER THEY PASSED LONG AGO BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THIS WORLD SO IT IS THAT LUTHIEN TINUVIEL ALONE OF THE ELFKINDRED HAS DIED INDEED AND LEFT THE WORLD AND THEY HAVE LOST HER WHOM THEY MOST LOVED BUT FROM HER THE LINEAGE OF THE ELFLORDS OF OLD DESCENDED AMONG MEN THERE LIVE STILL THOSE OF WHOM LUTHIEN WAS THE FOREMOTHER AND IT IS SAID THAT HER LINE SHALL NEVER FAIL ELROND OF RIVENDELL IS OF THAT KIN FOR OF BEREN AND LUTHIEN WAS BORN DIOR THINGOLS HEIR AND OF HIM ELWING THE WHITE WHOM EARENDIL WEDDED HE THAT SAILED HIS SHIP OUT OF THE MISTS OF THE WORLD INTO THE SEAS OF HEAVEN WITH THE SILMARIL UPON HIS BROW AND OF EARENDIL CAME THE KINGS OF NUMENOR THAT IS WESTERNESSE
AS STRIDER WAS SPEAKING THEY WATCHED HIS STRANGE EAGER FACE DIMLY LIT IN THE RED GLOW OF THE WOODFIRE HIS EYES SHONE AND HIS VOICE WAS RICH AND DEEP ABOVE HIM WAS A BLACK STARRY SKY SUDDENLY A PALE LIGHT APPEARED OVER THE CROWN OF WEATHERTOP BEHIND HIM THE WAXING MOON WAS CLIMBING SLOWLY ABOVE THE HILL THAT OVERSHADOWED THEM AND THE STARS ABOVE THE HILLTOP FADED
THE STORY ENDED THE HOBBITS MOVED AND STRETCHED LOOK SAID MERRY THE MOON IS RISING IT MUST BE GETTING LATE
THE OTHERS LOOKED UP EVEN AS THEY DID SO THEY SAW ON THE TOP OF THE HILL SOMETHING SMALL AND DARK AGAINST THE GLIMMER OF THE MOONRISE IT WAS PERHAPS ONLY A LARGE STONE OR JUTTING ROCK SHOWN UP BY THE PALE LIGHT
SAM AND MERRY GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY FROM THE FIRE FRODO AND PIPPIN REMAINED SEATED IN SILENCE STRIDER WAS WATCHING THE MOONLIGHT ON THE HILL INTENTLY ALL SEEMED QUIET AND STILL BUT FRODO FELT A COLD DREAD CREEPING OVER HIS HEART NOW THAT STRIDER WAS NO LONGER SPEAKING HE HUDDLED CLOSER TO THE FIRE AT THAT MOMENT SAM CAME RUNNING BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE DELL
I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS HE SAID BUT I SUDDENLY FELT AFRAID I DURSTNT GO OUTSIDE THIS DELL FOR ANY MONEY I FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS CREEPING UP THE SLOPE
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING ASKED FRODO SPRINGING TO HIS FEET
NO SIR I SAW NOTHING BUT I DIDNT STOP TO LOOK
I SAW SOMETHING SAID MERRY OR I THOUGHT I DID  AWAY WESTWARDS WHERE THE MOONLIGHT WAS FALLING ON THE FLATS BEYOND THE SHADOW OF THE HILLTOPS I THOUGHT THERE WERE TWO OR THREE BLACK SHAPES THEY SEEMED TO BE MOVING THIS WAY
KEEP CLOSE TO THE FIRE WITH YOUR FACES OUTWARD CRIED STRIDER GET SOME OF THE LONGER STICKS READY IN YOUR HANDS
FOR A BREATHLESS TIME THEY SAT THERE SILENT AND ALERT WITH THEIR BACKS TURNED TO THE WOODFIRE EACH GAZING INTO THE SHADOWS THAT ENCIRCLED THEM NOTHING HAPPENED THERE WAS NO SOUND OR MOVEMENT IN THE NIGHT FRODO STIRRED FEELING THAT HE MUST BREAK THE SILENCE HE LONGED TO SHOUT OUT ALOUD
HUSH WHISPERED STRIDER WHATS THAT GASPED PIPPIN AT THE SAME MOMENT
OVER THE LIP OF THE LITTLE DELL ON THE SIDE AWAY FROM THE HILL THEY FELT RATHER THAN SAW A SHADOW RISE ONE SHADOW OR MORE THAN ONE THEY STRAINED THEIR EYES AND THE SHADOWS SEEMED TO GROW SOON THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THREE OR FOUR TALL BLACK FIGURES WERE STANDING THERE ON THE SLOPE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM SO BLACK WERE THEY THAT THEY SEEMED LIKE BLACK HOLES IN THE DEEP SHADE BEHIND THEM FRODO THOUGHT THAT HE HEARD A FAINT HISS AS OF VENOMOUS BREATH AND FELT A THIN PIERCING CHILL THEN THE SHAPES SLOWLY ADVANCED
TERROR OVERCAME PIPPIN AND MERRY AND THEY THREW THEMSELVES FLAT ON THE GROUND SAM SHRANK TO FRODOS SIDE FRODO WAS HARDLY LESS TERRIFIED THAN HIS COMPANIONS HE WAS QUAKING AS IF HE WAS BITTER COLD BUT HIS TERROR WAS SWALLOWED UP IN A SUDDEN TEMPTATION TO PUT ON THE RING THE DESIRE TO DO THIS LAID HOLD OF HIM AND HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE HE DID NOT FORGET THE BARROW NOR THE MESSAGE OF GANDALF BUT SOMETHING SEEMED TO BE COMPELLING HIM TO DISREGARD ALL WARNINGS AND HE LONGED TO YIELD NOT WITH THE HOPE OF ESCAPE OR OF DOING ANYTHING EITHER GOOD OR BAD HE SIMPLY FELT THAT HE MUST TAKE THE RING AND PUT IT ON HIS FINGER HE COULD NOT SPEAK HE FELT SAM LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE KNEW THAT HIS MASTER WAS IN SOME GREAT TROUBLE BUT HE COULD NOT TURN TOWARDS HIM HE SHUT HIS EYES AND STRUGGLED FOR A WHILE BUT RESISTANCE BECAME UNBEARABLE AND AT LAST HE SLOWLY DREW OUT THE CHAIN AND SLIPPED THE RING ON THE FOREFINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND
IMMEDIATELY THOUGH EVERYTHING ELSE REMAINED AS BEFORE DIM AND DARK THE SHAPES BECAME TERRIBLY CLEAR HE WAS ABLE TO SEE BENEATH THEIR BLACK WRAPPINGS THERE WERE FIVE TALL FIGURES TWO STANDING ON THE LIP OF THE DELL THREE ADVANCING IN THEIR WHITE FACES BURNED KEEN AND MERCILESS EYES UNDER THEIR MANTLES WERE LONG GREY ROBES UPON THEIR GREY HAIRS WERE HELMS OF SILVER IN THEIR HAGGARD HANDS WERE SWORDS OF STEEL THEIR EYES FELL ON HIM AND PIERCED HIM AS THEY RUSHED TOWARDS HIM DESPERATE HE DREW HIS OWN SWORD AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FLICKERED RED AS IF IT WAS A FIREBRAND TWO OF THE FIGURES HALTED THE THIRD WAS TALLER THAN THE OTHERS HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND GLEAMING AND ON HIS HELM WAS A CROWN IN ONE HAND HE HELD A LONG SWORD AND IN THE OTHER A KNIFE BOTH THE KNIFE AND THE HAND THAT HELD IT GLOWED WITH A PALE LIGHT HE SPRANG FORWARD AND BORE DOWN ON FRODO
AT THAT MOMENT FRODO THREW HIMSELF FORWARD ON THE GROUND AND HE HEARD HIMSELF CRYING ALOUD O ELBERETH GILTHONIEL AT THE SAME TIME HE STRUCK AT THE FEET OF HIS ENEMY A SHRILL CRY RANG OUT IN THE NIGHT AND HE FELT A PAIN LIKE A DART OF POISONED ICE PIERCE HIS LEFT SHOULDER EVEN AS HE SWOONED HE CAUGHT AS THROUGH A SWIRLING MIST A GLIMPSE OF STRIDER LEAPING OUT OF THE DARKNESS WITH A FLAMING BRAND OF WOOD IN EITHER HAND WITH A LAST EFFORT FRODO DROPPING HIS SWORD SLIPPED THE RING FROM HIS FINGER AND CLOSED HIS RIGHT HAND TIGHT UPON IT



CHAPTER 12
FLIGHT TO THE FORD

WHEN FRODO CAME TO HIMSELF HE WAS STILL CLUTCHING THE RING DESPERATELY HE WAS LYING BY THE FIRE WHICH WAS NOW PILED HIGH AND BURNING BRIGHTLY HIS THREE COMPANIONS WERE BENDING OVER HIM WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHERE IS THE PALE KING HE ASKED WILDLY THEY WERE TOO OVERJOYED TO HEAR HIM SPEAK TO ANSWER FOR A WHILE NOR DID THEY UNDERSTAND HIS QUESTION AT LENGTH HE GATHERED FROM SAM THAT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING BUT THE VAGUE SHADOWY SHAPES COMING TOWARDS THEM SUDDENLY TO HIS HORROR SAM FOUND THAT HIS MASTER HAD VANISHED AND AT THAT MOMENT A BLACK SHADOW RUSHED PAST HIM AND HE FELL HE HEARD FRODOS VOICE BUT IT SEEMED TO COME FROM A GREAT DISTANCE OR FROM UNDER THE EARTH CRYING OUT STRANGE WORDS THEY SAW NOTHING MORE UNTIL THEY STUMBLED OVER THE BODY OF FRODO LYING AS IF DEAD FACE DOWNWARDS ON THE GRASS WITH HIS SWORD BENEATH HIM STRIDER ORDERED THEM TO PICK HIM UP AND LAY HIM NEAR THE FIRE AND THEN HE DISAPPEARED THAT WAS NOW A GOOD WHILE AGO
SAM PLAINLY WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE DOUBTS AGAIN ABOUT STRIDER BUT WHILE THEY WERE TALKING HE RETURNED APPEARING SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SHADOWS THEY STARTED AND SAM DREW HIS SWORD AND STOOD OVER FRODO BUT STRIDER KNELT DOWN SWIFTLY AT HIS SIDE
I AM NOT A BLACK RIDER SAM HE SAID GENTLY NOR IN LEAGUE WITH THEM I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOMETHING OF THEIR MOVEMENTS BUT I HAVE FOUND NOTHING I CANNOT THINK WHY THEY HAVE GONE AND DO NOT ATTACK AGAIN BUT THERE IS NO FEELING OF THEIR PRESENCE ANYWHERE AT HAND
WHEN HE HEARD WHAT FRODO HAD TO TELL HE BECAME FULL OF CONCERN AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SIGHED THEN HE ORDERED PIPPIN AND MERRY TO HEAT AS MUCH WATER AS THEY COULD IN THEIR SMALL KETTLES AND TO BATHE THE WOUND WITH IT KEEP THE FIRE GOING WELL AND KEEP FRODO WARM HE SAID THEN HE GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY AND CALLED SAM TO HIM I THINK I UNDERSTAND THINGS BETTER NOW HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE THERE SEEM ONLY TO HAVE BEEN FIVE OF THE ENEMY WHY THEY WERE NOT ALL HERE I DONT KNOW BUT I DONT THINK THEY EXPECTED TO BE RESISTED THEY HAVE DRAWN OFF FOR THE TIME BEING BUT NOT FAR I FEAR THEY WILL COME AGAIN ANOTHER NIGHT IF WE CANNOT ESCAPE THEY ARE ONLY WAITING BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THEIR PURPOSE IS ALMOST ACCOMPLISHED AND THAT THE RING CANNOT FLY MUCH FURTHER I FEAR SAM THAT THEY BELIEVE YOUR MASTER HAS A DEADLY WOUND THAT WILL SUBDUE HIM TO THEIR WILL WE SHALL SEE SAM CHOKED WITH TEARS DONT DESPAIR SAID STRIDER YOU MUST TRUST ME NOW YOUR FRODO IS MADE OF STERNER STUFF THAN I HAD GUESSED THOUGH GANDALF HINTED THAT IT MIGHT PROVE SO HE IS NOT SLAIN AND I THINK HE WILL RESIST THE EVIL POWER OF THE WOUND LONGER THAN HIS ENEMIES EXPECT I WILL DO ALL I CAN TO HELP AND HEAL HIM GUARD HIM WELL WHILE I AM AWAY HE HURRIED OFF AND DISAPPEARED AGAIN INTO THE DARKNESS
FRODO DOZED THOUGH THE PAIN OF HIS WOUND WAS SLOWLY GROWING AND A DEADLY CHILL WAS SPREADING FROM HIS SHOULDER TO HIS ARM AND SIDE HIS FRIENDS WATCHED OVER HIM WARMING HIM AND BATHING HIS WOUND THE NIGHT PASSED SLOWLY AND WEARILY DAWN WAS GROWING IN THE SKY AND THE DELL WAS FILLING WITH GREY LIGHT WHEN STRIDER AT LAST RETURNED
LOOK HE CRIED AND STOOPING HE LIFTED FROM THE GROUND A BLACK CLOAK THAT HAD LAIN THERE HIDDEN BY THE DARKNESS A FOOT ABOVE THE LOWER HEM THERE WAS A SLASH THIS WAS THE STROKE OF FRODOS SWORD HE SAID THE ONLY HURT THAT IT DID TO HIS ENEMY I FEAR FOR IT IS UNHARMED BUT ALL BLADES PERISH THAT PIERCE THAT DREADFUL KING MORE DEADLY TO HIM WAS THE NAME OF ELBERETH
AND MORE DEADLY TO FRODO WAS THIS HE STOOPED AGAIN AND LIFTED UP A LONG THIN KNIFE THERE WAS A COLD GLEAM IN IT AS STRIDER RAISED IT THEY SAW THAT NEAR THE END ITS EDGE WAS NOTCHED AND THE POINT WAS BROKEN OFF BUT EVEN AS HE HELD IT UP IN THE GROWING LIGHT THEY GAZED IN ASTONISHMENT FOR THE BLADE SEEMED TO MELT AND VANISHED LIKE A SMOKE IN THE AIR LEAVING ONLY THE HILT IN STRIDERS HAND ALAS HE CRIED IT WAS THIS ACCURSED KNIFE THAT GAVE THE WOUND FEW NOW HAVE THE SKILL IN HEALING TO MATCH SUCH EVIL WEAPONS BUT I WILL DO WHAT I CAN
HE SAT DOWN ON THE GROUND AND TAKING THE DAGGERHILT LAID IT ON HIS KNEES AND HE SANG OVER IT A SLOW SONG IN A STRANGE TONGUE THEN SETTING IT ASIDE HE TURNED TO FRODO AND IN A SOFT TONE SPOKE WORDS THE OTHERS COULD NOT CATCH FROM THE POUCH AT HIS BELT HE DREW OUT THE LONG LEAVES OF A PLANT
THESE LEAVES HE SAID I HAVE WALKED FAR TO FIND FOR THIS PLANT DOES NOT GROW IN THE BARE HILLS BUT IN THE THICKETS AWAY SOUTH OF THE ROAD I FOUND IT IN THE DARK BY THE SCENT OF ITS LEAVES HE CRUSHED A LEAF IN HIS FINGERS AND IT GAVE OUT A SWEET AND PUNGENT FRAGRANCE IT IS FORTUNATE THAT I COULD FIND IT FOR IT IS A HEALING PLANT THAT THE MEN OF THE WEST BROUGHT TO MIDDLEEARTH ATHELAS THEY NAMED IT AND IT GROWS NOW SPARSELY AND ONLY NEAR PLACES WHERE THEY DWELT OR CAMPED OF OLD AND IT IS NOT KNOWN IN THE NORTH EXCEPT TO SOME OF THOSE WHO WANDER IN THE WILD IT HAS GREAT VIRTUES BUT OVER SUCH A WOUND AS THIS ITS HEALING POWERS MAY BE SMALL
HE THREW THE LEAVES INTO BOILING WATER AND BATHED FRODOS SHOULDER THE FRAGRANCE OF THE STEAM WAS REFRESHING AND THOSE THAT WERE UNHURT FELT THEIR MINDS CALMED AND CLEARED THE HERB HAD ALSO SOME POWER OVER THE WOUND FOR FRODO FELT THE PAIN AND ALSO THE SENSE OF FROZEN COLD LESSEN IN HIS SIDE BUT THE LIFE DID NOT RETURN TO HIS ARM AND HE COULD NOT RAISE OR USE HIS HAND HE BITTERLY REGRETTED HIS FOOLISHNESS AND REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR WEAKNESS OF WILL FOR HE NOW PERCEIVED THAT IN PUTTING ON THE RING HE OBEYED NOT HIS OWN DESIRE BUT THE COMMANDING WISH OF HIS ENEMIES HE WONDERED IF HE WOULD REMAIN MAIMED FOR LIFE AND HOW THEY WOULD NOW MANAGE TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY HE FELL TOO WEAK TO STAND
THE OTHERS WERE DISCUSSING THIS VERY QUESTION THEY QUICKLY DECIDED TO LEAVE WEATHERTOP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I THINK NOW SAID STRIDER THAT THE ENEMY HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS PLACE FOR SOME DAYS IF GANDALF EVER CAME HERE THEN HE MUST HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RIDE AWAY AND HE WILL NOT RETURN IN ANY CASE WE ARE IN GREAT PERIL HERE AFTER DARK SINCE THE ATTACK OF LAST NIGHT AND WE CAN HARDLY MEET GREATER DANGER WHEREVER WE GO
AS SOON AS THE DAYLIGHT WAS FULL THEY HAD SOME HURRIED FOOD AND PACKED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR FRODO TO WALK SO THEY DIVIDED THE GREATER PART OF THEIR BAGGAGE AMONG THE FOUR OF THEM AND PUT FRODO ON THE PONY IN THE LAST FEW DAYS THE POOR BEAST HAD IMPROVED WONDERFULLY IT ALREADY SEEMED FATTER AND STRONGER AND HAD BEGUN TO SHOW AN AFFECTION FOR ITS NEW MASTERS ESPECIALLY FOR SAM BILL FERNYS TREATMENT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY HARD FOR THE JOURNEY IN THE WILD TO SEEM SO MUCH BETTER THAN ITS FORMER LIFE
THEY STARTED OFF IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION THIS WOULD MEAN CROSSING THE ROAD BUT IT WAS THE QUICKEST WAY TO MORE WOODED COUNTRY AND THEY NEEDED FUEL FOR STRIDER SAID THAT FRODO MUST BE KEPT WARM ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WHILE FIRE WOULD BE SOME PROTECTION FOR THEM ALL IT WAS ALSO HIS PLAN TO SHORTEN THEIR JOURNEY BY CUTTING ACROSS ANOTHER GREAT LOOP OF THE ROAD EAST BEYOND WEATHERTOP IT CHANGED ITS COURSE AND TOOK A WIDE BEND NORTHWARDS
THEY MADE THEIR WAY SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY ROUND THE SOUTHWESTERN SLOPES OF THE HILL AND CAME IN A LITTLE WHILE TO THE EDGE OF THE ROAD THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE RIDERS BUT EVEN AS THEY WERE HURRYING ACROSS THEY HEARD FAR AWAY TWO CRIES A COLD VOICE CALLING AND A COLD VOICE ANSWERING TREMBLING THEY SPRANG FORWARD AND MADE FOR THE THICKETS THAT LAY AHEAD THE LAND BEFORE THEM SLOPED AWAY SOUTHWARDS BUT IT WAS WILD AND PATHLESS BUSHES AND STUNTED TREES GREW IN DENSE PATCHES WITH WIDE BARREN SPACES IN BETWEEN THE GRASS WAS SCANTY COARSE AND GREY AND THE LEAVES IN THE THICKETS WERE FADED AND FALLING IT WAS A CHEERLESS LAND AND THEIR JOURNEY WAS SLOW AND GLOOMY THEY SPOKE LITTLE AS THEY TRUDGED ALONG FRODOS HEART WAS GRIEVED AS HE WATCHED THEM WALKING BESIDE HIM WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN AND THEIR BACKS BOWED UNDER THEIR BURDENS EVEN STRIDER SEEMED TIRED AND HEAVYHEARTED
BEFORE THE FIRST DAYS MARCH WAS OVER FRODOS PAIN BEGAN TO GROW AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OF IT FOR A LONG TIME FOUR DAYS PASSED WITHOUT THE GROUND OR THE SCENE CHANGING MUCH EXCEPT THAT BEHIND THEM WEATHERTOP SLOWLY SANK AND BEFORE THEM THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS LOOMED A LITTLE NEARER YET SINCE THAT FAR CRY THEY HAD SEEN AND HEARD NO SIGN THAT THE ENEMY HAD MARKED THEIR FLIGHT OR FOLLOWED THEM THEY DREADED THE DARK HOURS AND KEPT WATCH IN PAIRS BY NIGHT EXPECTING AT ANY TIME TO SEE BLACK SHAPES STALKING IN THE GREY NIGHT DIMLY LIT BY THE CLOUDVEILED MOON BUT THEY SAW NOTHING AND HEARD NO SOUND BUT THE SIGH OF WITHERED LEAVES AND GRASS NOT ONCE DID THEY FEEL THE SENSE OF PRESENT EVIL THAT HAD ASSAILED THEM BEFORE THE ATTACK IN THE DELL IT SEEMED TOO MUCH TO HOPE THAT THE RIDERS HAD ALREADY LOST THEIR TRAIL AGAIN PERHAPS THEY WERE WAITING TO MAKE SOME AMBUSH IN A NARROW PLACE
AT THE END OF THE FIFTH DAY THE GROUND BEGAN ONCE MORE TO RISE SLOWLY OUT OF THE WIDE SHALLOW VALLEY INTO WHICH THEY HAD DESCENDED STRIDER NOW TURNED THEIR COURSE AGAIN NORTHEASTWARDS AND ON THE SIXTH DAY THEY REACHED THE TOP OF A LONG SLOWCLIMBING SLOPE AND SAW FAR AHEAD A HUDDLE OF WOODED HILLS AWAY BELOW THEM THEY COULD SEE THE ROAD SWEEPING ROUND THE FEET OF THE HILLS AND TO THEIR RIGHT A GREY RIVER GLEAMED PALE IN THE THIN SUNSHINE IN THE DISTANCE THEY GLIMPSED YET ANOTHER RIVER IN A STONY VALLEY HALFVEILED IN MIST
I AM AFRAID WE MUST GO BACK TO THE ROAD HERE FOR A WHILE SAID STRIDER WE HAVE NOW COME TO THE RIVER HOARWELL THAT THE ELVES CALL MITHEITHEL IT FLOWS DOWN OUT OF THE ETTENMOORS THE TROLLFELLS NORTH OF RIVENDELL AND JOINS THE LOUDWATER AWAY IN THE SOUTH SOME CALL IT THE GREYFLOOD AFTER THAT IT IS A GREAT WATER BEFORE IT FINDS THE SEA THERE IS NO WAY OVER IT BELOW ITS SOURCES IN THE ETTENMOORS EXCEPT BY THE LAST BRIDGE ON WHICH THE ROAD CROSSES
WHAT IS THAT OTHER RIVER WE CAN SEE FAR AWAY THERE ASKED MERRY
THAT IS LOUDWATER THE BRUINEN OF RIVENDELL ANSWERED STRIDER THE ROAD RUNS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE HILLS FOR MANY MILES FROM THE BRIDGE TO THE FORD OF BRUINEN BUT I HAVE NOT YET THOUGHT HOW WE SHALL CROSS THAT WATER ONE RIVER AT A TIME WE SHALL BE FORTUNATE INDEED IF WE DO NOT FIND THE LAST BRIDGE HELD AGAINST US
NEXT DAY EARLY IN THE MORNING THEY CAME DOWN AGAIN TO THE BORDERS OF THE ROAD SAM AND STRIDER WENT FORWARD BUT THEY FOUND NO SIGN OF ANY TRAVELLERS OR RIDERS HERE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HILLS THERE HAD BEEN SOME RAIN STRIDER JUDGED THAT IT HAD FALLEN TWO DAYS BEFORE AND HAD WASHED AWAY ALL FOOTPRINTS NO HORSEMAN HAD PASSED SINCE THEN AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE
THEY HURRIED ALONG WITH ALL THE SPEED THEY COULD MAKE AND AFTER A MILE OR TWO THEY SAW THE LAST BRIDGE AHEAD AT THE BOTTOM OF A SHORT STEEP SLOPE THEY DREADED TO SEE BLACK FIGURES WAITING THERE BUT THEY SAW NONE STRIDER MADE THEM TAKE COVER IN A THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHILE HE WENT FORWARD TO EXPLORE
BEFORE LONG HE CAME HURRYING BACK I CAN SEE NO SIGN OF THE ENEMY HE SAID AND I WONDER VERY MUCH WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING VERY STRANGE
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AND SHOWED A SINGLE PALEGREEN JEWEL I FOUND IT IN THE MUD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE HE SAID IT IS A BERYL AN ELFSTONE WHETHER IT WAS SET THERE OR LET FALL BY CHANCE I CANNOT SAY BUT IT BRINGS HOPE TO ME I WILL TAKE IT AS A SIGN THAT WE MAY PASS THE BRIDGE BUT BEYOND THAT I DARE NOT KEEP TO THE ROAD WITHOUT SOME CLEARER TOKEN
AT ONCE THEY WENT ON AGAIN THEY CROSSED THE BRIDGE IN SAFETY HEARING NO SOUND BUT THE WATER SWIRLING AGAINST ITS THREE GREAT ARCHES A MILE FURTHER ON THEY CAME TO A NARROW RAVINE THAT LED AWAY NORTHWARDS THROUGH THE STEEP LANDS ON THE LEFT OF THE ROAD HERE STRIDER TURNED ASIDE AND SOON THEY WERE LOST IN A SOMBRE COUNTRY OF DARK TREES WINDING AMONG THE FEET OF SULLEN HILLS
THE HOBBITS WERE GLAD TO LEAVE THE CHEERLESS LANDS AND THE PERILOUS ROAD BEHIND THEM BUT THIS NEW COUNTRY SEEMED THREATENING AND UNFRIENDLY AS THEY WENT FORWARD THE HILLS ABOUT THEM STEADILY ROSE HERE AND THERE UPON HEIGHTS AND RIDGES THEY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT WALLS OF STONE AND THE RUINS OF TOWERS THEY HAD AN OMINOUS LOOK FRODO WHO WAS NOT WALKING HAD TIME TO GAZE AHEAD AND TO THINK HE RECALLED BILBOS ACCOUNT OF HIS JOURNEY AND THE THREATENING TOWERS ON THE HILLS NORTH OF THE ROAD IN THE COUNTRY NEAR THE TROLLS WOOD WHERE HIS FIRST SERIOUS ADVENTURE HAD HAPPENED FRODO GUESSED THAT THEY WERE NOW IN THE SAME REGION AND WONDERED IF BY CHANCE THEY WOULD PASS NEAR THE SPOT
WHO LIVES IN THIS LAND HE ASKED AND WHO BUILT THESE TOWERS IS THIS TROLLCOUNTRY
NO SAID STRIDER TROLLS DO NOT BUILD NO ONE LIVES IN THIS LAND MEN ONCE DWELT HERE AGES AGO BUT NONE REMAIN NOW THEY BECAME AN EVIL PEOPLE AS LEGENDS TELL FOR THEY FELL UNDER THE SHADOW OF ANGMAR BUT ALL WERE DESTROYED IN THE WAR THAT BROUGHT THE NORTH KINGDOM TO ITS END BUT THAT IS NOW SO LONG AGO THAT THE HILLS HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM THOUGH A SHADOW STILL LIES ON THE LAND
WHERE DID YOU LEARN SUCH TALES IF ALL THE LAND IS EMPTY AND FORGETFUL ASKED PEREGRIN THE BIRDS AND BEASTS DO NOT TELL TALES OF THAT SON
THE HEIRS OF ELENDIL DO NOT FORGET ALL THINGS PAST SAID STRIDER AND MANY MORE THINGS THAN I CAN TELL ARE REMEMBERED IN RIVENDELL
HAVE YOU OFTEN BEEN TO RIVENDELL SAID FRODO
I HAVE SAID STRIDER I DWELT THERE ONCE AND STILL I RETURN WHEN I MAY THERE MY HEART IS BUT IT IS NOT MY FATE TO SIT IN PEACE EVEN IN THE FAIR HOUSE OF ELROND
THE HILLS NOW BEGAN TO SHUT THEM IN THE ROAD BEHIND HELD ON ITS WAY TO THE RIVER BRUINEN BUT BOTH WERE NOW HIDDEN FROM VIEW THE TRAVELLERS CAME INTO A LONG VALLEY NARROW DEEPLY CLOVEN DARK AND SILENT TREES WITH OLD AND TWISTED ROOTS HUNG OVER CLIFFS AND PILED UP BEHIND INTO MOUNTING SLOPES OF PINEWOOD
THE HOBBITS GREW VERY WEARY THEY ADVANCED SLOWLY FOR THEY HAD TO PICK THEIR WAY THROUGH A PATHLESS COUNTRY ENCUMBERED BY FALLEN TREES AND TUMBLED ROCKS AS LONG AS THEY COULD THEY AVOIDED CLIMBING FOR FRODOS SAKE AND BECAUSE IT WAS IN FACT DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY WAY UP OUT OF THE NARROW DALES THEY HAD BEEN TWO DAYS IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN THE WEATHER TURNED WET THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW STEADILY OUT OF THE WEST AND POUR THE WATER OF THE DISTANT SEAS ON THE DARK HEADS OF THE HILLS IN FINE DRENCHING RAIN BY NIGHTFALL THEY WERE ALL SOAKED AND THEIR CAMP WAS CHEERLESS FOR THEY COULD NOT GET ANY FIRE TO BURN THE NEXT DAY THE HILLS ROSE STILL HIGHER AND STEEPER BEFORE THEM AND THEY WERE FORCED TO TURN AWAY NORTHWARDS OUT OF THEIR COURSE STRIDER SEEMED TO BE GETTING ANXIOUS THEY WERE NEARLY TEN DAYS OUT FROM WEATHERTOP AND THEIR STOCK OF PROVISIONS WAS BEGINNING TO RUN LOW IT WENT ON RAINING
THAT NIGHT THEY CAMPED ON A STONY SHELF WITH A ROCKWALL BEHIND THEM IN WHICH THERE WAS A SHALLOW CAVE A MERE SCOOP IN THE CLIFF FRODO WAS RESTLESS THE COLD AND WET HAD MADE HIS WOUND MORE PAINFUL THAN EVER AND THE ACHE AND SENSE OF DEADLY CHILL TOOK AWAY ALL SLEEP HE LAY TOSSING AND TURNING AND LISTENING FEARFULLY TO THE STEALTHY NIGHTNOISES WIND IN CHINKS OF ROCK WATER DRIPPING A CRACK THE SUDDEN RATTLING FALL OF A LOOSENED STONE HE FELT THAT BLACK SHAPES WERE ADVANCING TO SMOTHER HIM BUT WHEN HE SAT UP HE SAW NOTHING BUT THE BACK OF STRIDER SITTING HUNCHED UP SMOKING HIS PIPE AND WATCHING HE LAY DOWN AGAIN AND PASSED INTO AN UNEASY DREAM IN WHICH HE WALKED ON THE GRASS IN HIS GARDEN IN THE SHIRE BUT IT SEEMED FAINT AND DIM LESS CLEAR THAN THE TALL BLACK SHADOWS THAT STOOD LOOKING OVER THE HEDGE
IN THE MORNING HE WOKE TO FIND THAT THE RAIN HAD STOPPED THE CLOUDS WERE STILL THICK BUT THEY WERE BREAKING AND PALE STRIPS OF BLUE APPEARED BETWEEN THEM THE WIND WAS SHIFTING AGAIN THEY DID NOT START EARLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR COLD AND COMFORTLESS BREAKFAST STRIDER WENT OFF ALONE TELLING THE OTHERS TO REMAIN UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE CLIFF UNTIL HE CAME BACK HE WAS GOING TO CLIMB UP IF HE COULD AND GET A LOOK AT THE LIE OF THE LAND
WHEN HE RETURNED HE WAS NOT REASSURING WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO THE NORTH HE SAID AND WE MUST FIND SOME WAY TO TURN BACK SOUTHWARDS AGAIN IF WE KEEP ON AS WE ARE GOING WE SHALL GET UP INTO THE ETTENDALES FAR NORTH OF RIVENDELL THAT IS TROLLCOUNTRY AND LITTLE KNOWN TO ME WE COULD PERHAPS FIND OUR WAY THROUGH AND COME ROUND TO RIVENDELL FROM THE NORTH BUT IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG FOR I DO NOT KNOW THE WAY AND OUR FOOD WOULD NOT LAST SO SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE MUST FIND THE FORD OF BRUINEN
THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY SPENT SCRAMBLING OVER ROCKY GROUND THEY FOUND A PASSAGE BETWEEN TWO HILLS THAT LED THEM INTO A VALLEY RUNNING SOUTHEAST THE DIRECTION THAT THEY WISHED TO TAKE BUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY THEY FOUND THEIR ROAD AGAIN BARRED BY A RIDGE OF HIGH LAND ITS DARK EDGE AGAINST THE SKY WAS BROKEN INTO MANY BARE POINTS LIKE TEETH OF A BLUNTED SAW THEY HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN GOING BACK OR CLIMBING OVER IT
THEY DECIDED TO ATTEMPT THE CLIMB BUT IT PROVED VERY DIFFICULT BEFORE LONG FRODO WAS OBLIGED TO DISMOUNT AND STRUGGLE ALONG ON FOOT EVEN SO THEY OFTEN DESPAIRED OF GETTING THEIR PONY UP OR INDEED OF FINDING A PATH FOR THEMSELVES BURDENED AS THEY WERE THE LIGHT WAS NEARLY GONE AND THEY WERE ALL EXHAUSTED WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE TOP THEY HAD CLIMBED ON TO A NARROW SADDLE BETWEEN TWO HIGHER POINTS AND THE LAND FELL STEEPLY AWAY AGAIN ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE AHEAD FRODO THREW HIMSELF DOWN AND LAY ON THE GROUND SHIVERING HIS LEFT ARM WAS LIFELESS AND HIS SIDE AND SHOULDER FELT AS IF ICY CLAWS WERE LAID UPON THEM THE TREES AND ROCKS ABOUT HIM SEEMED SHADOWY AND DIM
WE CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER SAID MERRY TO STRIDER I AM AFRAID THIS HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR FRODO I AM DREADFULLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM WHAT ARE WE TO DO DO YOU THINK THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CURE HIM IN RIVENDELL IF WE EVER GET THERE
WE SHALL SEE ANSWERED STRIDER THERE IS NOTHING MORE THAT I CAN DO IN THE WILDERNESS AND IT IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF HIS WOUND THAT I AM SO ANXIOUS TO PRESS ON BUT I AGREE THAT WE CAN GO NO FURTHER TONIGHT
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH MY MASTER ASKED SAM IN A LOW VOICE LOOKING APPEALINGLY AT STRIDER HIS WOUND WAS SMALL AND IT IS ALREADY CLOSED THERES NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT A COLD WHITE MARK ON HIS SHOULDER
FRODO HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY THE WEAPONS OF THE ENEMY SAID STRIDER AND THERE IS SOME POISON OR EVIL AT WORK THAT IS BEYOND MY SKILL TO DRIVE OUT BUT DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE SAM
NIGHT WAS COLD UP ON THE HIGH RIDGE THEY LIT A SMALL FIRE DOWN UNDER THE GNARLED ROOTS OF AN OLD PINE THAT HUNG OVER A SHALLOW PIT IT LOOKED AS IF STONE HAD ONCE BEEN QUARRIED THERE THEY SAT HUDDLED TOGETHER THE WIND BLEW CHILL THROUGH THE PASS AND THEY HEARD THE TREETOPS LOWER DOWN MOANING AND SIGHING FRODO LAY HALF IN A DREAM IMAGINING THAT ENDLESS DARK WINGS WERE SWEEPING BY ABOVE HIM AND THAT ON THE WINGS RODE PURSUERS THAT SOUGHT HIM IN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE HILLS
THE MORNING DAWNED BRIGHT AND FAIR THE AIR WAS CLEAN AND THE LIGHT PALE AND CLEAR IN A RAINWASHED SKY THEIR HEARTS WERE ENCOURAGED BUT THEY LONGED FOR THE SUN TO WARM THEIR COLD STIFF LIMBS AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT STRIDER TOOK MERRY WITH HIM AND WENT TO SURVEY THE COUNTRY FROM THE HEIGHT TO THE EAST OF THE PASS THE SUN HAD RISEN AND WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY WHEN HE RETURNED WITH MORE COMFORTING NEWS THEY WERE NOW GOING MORE OR LESS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IF THEY WENT ON DOWN THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGE THEY WOULD HAVE THE MOUNTAINS ON THEIR LEFT SOME WAY AHEAD STRIDER HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE LOUDWATER AGAIN AND HE KNEW THAT THOUGH IT WAS HIDDEN FROM VIEW THE ROAD TO THE FORD WAS NOT FAR FROM THE RIVER AND LAY ON THE SIDE NEAREST TO THEM
WE MUST MAKE FOR THE ROAD AGAIN HE SAID WE CANNOT HOPE TO FIND A PATH THROUGH THESE HILLS WHATEVER DANGER MAY BESET IT THE ROAD IS OUR ONLY WAY TO THE FORD
AS SOON AS THEY HAD EATEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN THEY CLIMBED SLOWLY DOWN THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE RIDGE BUT THE WAY WAS MUCH EASIER THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED FOR THE SLOPE WAS FAR LESS STEEP ON THIS SIDE AND BEFORE LONG FRODO WAS ABLE TO RIDE AGAIN BILL FERNYS POOR OLD PONY WAS DEVELOPING AN UNEXPECTED TALENT FOR PICKING OUT A PATH AND FOR SPARING ITS RIDER AS MANY JOLTS AS POSSIBLE THE SPIRITS OF THE PARTY ROSE AGAIN EVEN FRODO FELT BETTER IN THE MORNING LIGHT BUT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN A MIST SEEMED TO OBSCURE HIS SIGHT AND HE PASSED HIS HANDS OVER HIS EYES
PIPPIN WAS A LITTLE AHEAD OF THE OTHERS SUDDENLY HE TURNED ROUND AND CALLED TO THEM THERE IS A PATH HERE HE CRIED
WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH HIM THEY SAW THAT HE HAD MADE NO MISTAKE THERE WERE CLEARLY THE BEGINNINGS OF A PATH THAT CLIMBED WITH MANY WINDINGS OUT OF THE WOODS BELOW AND FADED AWAY ON THE HILLTOP BEHIND IN PLACES IT WAS NOW FAINT AND OVERGROWN OR CHOKED WITH FALLEN STONES AND TREES BUT AT ONE TIME IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MUCH USED IT WAS A PATH MADE BY STRONG ARMS AND HEAVY FEET HERE AND THERE OLD TREES HAD BEEN CUT OR BROKEN DOWN AND LARGE ROCKS CLOVEN OR HEAVED ASIDE TO MAKE A WAY
THEY FOLLOWED THE TRACK FOR SOME WHILE FOR IT OFFERED MUCH THE EASIEST WAY DOWN BUT THEY WENT CAUTIOUSLY AND THEIR ANXIETY INCREASED AS THEY CAME INTO THE DARK WOODS AND THE PATH GREW PLAINER AND BROADER SUDDENLY COMING OUT OF A BELT OF FIRTREES IT RAN STEEPLY DOWN A SLOPE AND TURNED SHARPLY TO THE LEFT ROUND THE COMER OF A ROCKY SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHEN THEY CAME TO THE COMER THEY LOOKED ROUND AND SAW THAT THE PATH RAN ON OVER A LEVEL STRIP UNDER THE FACE OF A LOW CLIFF OVERHUNG WITH TREES IN THE STONY WALL THERE WAS A DOOR HANGING CROOKEDLY AJAR UPON ONE GREAT HINGE
OUTSIDE THE DOOR THEY ALL HALTED THERE WAS A CAVE OR ROCKCHAMBER BEHIND BUT IN THE GLOOM INSIDE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN STRIDER SAM AND MERRY PUSHING WITH ALL THEIR STRENGTH MANAGED TO OPEN THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER AND THEN STRIDER AND MERRY WENT IN THEY DID NOT GO FAR FOR ON THE FLOOR LAY MANY OLD BONES AND NOTHING ELSE WAS TO BE SEEN NEAR THE ENTRANCE EXCEPT SOME GREAT EMPTY JARS AND BROKEN POTS
SURELY THIS IS A TROLLHOLE IF EVER THERE WAS ONE SAID PIPPIN COME OUT YOU TWO AND LET US GET AWAY NOW WE KNOW WHO MADE THE PATH  AND WE HAD BETTER GET OFF IT QUICK
THERE IS NO NEED I THINK SAID STRIDER COINING OUT IT IS CERTAINLY A TROLLHOLE BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LONG FORSAKEN I DONT THINK WE NEED BE AFRAID BUT LET US GO ON DOWN WARILY AND WE SHALL SEE
THE PATH WENT ON AGAIN FROM THE DOOR AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT AGAIN ACROSS THE LEVEL SPACE PLUNGED DOWN A THICK WOODED SLOPE PIPPIN NOT LIKING TO SHOW STRIDER THAT HE WAS STILL AFRAID WENT ON AHEAD WITH MERRY SAM AND STRIDER CAME BEHIND ONE ON EACH SIDE OF FRODOS PONY FOR THE PATH WAS NOW BROAD ENOUGH FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOBBITS TO WALK ABREAST BUT THEY HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE PIPPIN CAME RUNNING BACK FOLLOWED BY MERRY THEY BOTH LOOKED TERRIFIED
THERE ARE TROLLS PIPPIN PANTED DOWN IN A CLEARING IN THE WOODS NOT FAR BELOW WE GOT A SIGHT OF THEM THROUGH THE TREETRUNKS THEY ARE VERY LARGE
WE WILL COME AND LOOK AT THEM SAID STRIDER PICKING UP A STICK FRODO SAID NOTHING BUT SAM LOOKED SCARED
THE SUN WAS NOW HIGH AND IT SHONE DOWN THROUGH THE HALFSTRIPPED BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND LIT THE CLEARING WITH BRIGHT PATCHES OF LIGHT THEY HALTED SUDDENLY ON THE EDGE AND PEERED THROUGH THE TREETRUNKS HOLDING THEIR BREATH THERE STOOD THE TROLLS THREE LARGE TROLLS ONE WAS STOOPING AND THE OTHER TWO STOOD STARING AT HIM
STRIDER WALKED FORWARD UNCONCERNEDLY GET UP OLD STONE HE SAID AND BROKE HIS STICK UPON THE STOOPING TROLL
NOTHING HAPPENED THERE WAS A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT FROM THE HOBBITS AND THEN EVEN FRODO LAUGHED WELL HE SAID WE ARE FORGETTING OUR FAMILY HISTORY THESE MUST BE THE VERY THREE THAT WERE CAUGHT BY GANDALF QUARRELLING OVER THE RIGHT WAY TO COOK THIRTEEN DWARVES AND ONE HOBBIT
I HAD NO IDEA WE WERE ANYWHERE NEAR THE PLACE SAID PIPPIN HE KNEW THE STORY WELL BILBO AND FRODO HAD TOLD IT OFTEN BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT HE HAD NEVER MORE THAN HALF BELIEVED IT EVEN NOW HE LOOKED AT THE STONE TROLLS WITH SUSPICION WONDERING IF SOME MAGIC MIGHT NOT SUDDENLY BRING THEM TO LIFE AGAIN
YOU ARE FORGETTING NOT ONLY YOUR FAMILY HISTORY BUT ALL YOU EVER KNEW ABOUT TROLLS SAID STRIDER IT IS BROAD DAYLIGHT WITH A BRIGHT SUN AND YET YOU COME BACK TRYING TO SCARE ME WITH A TALE OF LIVE TROLLS WAITING FOR US IN THIS GLADE IN ANY CASE YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM HAS AN OLD BIRDS NEST BEHIND HIS EAR THAT WOULD BE A MOST UNUSUAL ORNAMENT FOR A LIVE TROLL
THEY ALL LAUGHED FRODO FELT HIS SPIRITS REVIVING THE REMINDER OF BILBOS FIRST SUCCESSFUL ADVENTURE WAS HEARTENING THE SUN TOO WAS WARM AND COMFORTING AND THE MIST BEFORE HIS EYES SEEMED TO BE LIFTING A LITTLE THEY RESTED FOR SOME TIME IN THE GLADE AND TOOK THEIR MIDDAY MEAL RIGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE TROLLS LARGE LEGS

WONT SOMEBODY GIVE US A BIT OF A SONG WHILE THE SUN IS HIGH SAID MERRY WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED WE HAVENT HAD A SONG OR A TALE FOR DAYS
NOT SINCE WEATHERTOP SAID FRODO THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM DONT WORRY ABOUT ME HE ADDED I FEEL MUCH BETTER BUT I DONT THINK I COULD SING PERHAPS SAM COULD DIG SOMETHING OUT OF HIS MEMORY
COME ON SAM SAID MERRY THERES MORE STORED IN YOUR HEAD THAN YOU LET ON ABOUT
I DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID SAM BUT HOW WOULD THIS SUIT IT AINT WHAT I CALL PROPER POETRY IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME JUST A BIT OF NONSENSE BUT THESE OLD IMAGES HERE BROUGHT IT TO MY MIND STANDING UP WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK AS IF HE WAS AT SCHOOL HE BEGAN TO SING TO AN OLD TUNE
TROLL SAT ALONE ON HIS SEAT OF STONE
AND MUNCHED AND MUMBLED A BARE OLD BONE
FOR MANY A YEAR HE HAD GNAWED IT NEAR
FOR MEAT WAS HARD TO COME BY
DONE BY GUM BY
IN A CASE IN THE HILLS HE DWELT ALONE
AND MEAT WAS HARD TO COME BY

UP CAME TOM WITH HIS BIG BOOTS ON
SAID HE TO TROLL PRAY WHAT IS YON
FOR IT LOOKS LIKE THE SHIN O MY NUNCLE TIM
AS SHOULD BE ALYIN IN GRAVEYARD
CAVEYARD PAVEYARD
THIS MANY A YEAR HAS TIM BEEN GONE
AND I THOUGHT HE WERE LYIN IN GRAVEYARD

MY LAD SAID TROLL THIS BONE I STOLE
BUT WHAT BE BONES THAT LIE IN A HOLE
THY NUNCLE WAS DEAD AS A LUMP O LEAD
AFORE I FOUND HIS SHINBONE
TINBONE THINBONE
HE CAN SPARE A SHARE FOR A POOR OLD TROLL
FOR HE DONT NEED HIS SHINBONE

SAID TOM I DONT SEE WHY THE LIKES O THEE
WITHOUT AXIN LEAVE SHOULD GO MAKIN FREE
WITH THE SHANK OR THE SHIN O MY FATHERS KIN
SO HAND THE OLD BONE OVER
ROVER TROVER
THOUGH DEAD HE BE IT BELONGS TO HE
SO HAND THE OLD BONE OVER

FOR A COUPLE O PINS SAYS TROLL AND GRINS
ILL EAT THEE TOO AND GNAW THY SHINS
A BIT O FRESH MEAL WILL GO DOWN SWEET
ILL TRY MY TEETH ON THEE NOW
HEE NOW SEE NOW
IM TIRED O GNAWING OLD BONES AND SKINS
IVE A MIND TO DINE ON THEE NOW

BUT JUST AS HE THOUGHT HIS DINNER WAS CAUGHT
HE FOUND HIS HANDS HAD HOLD OF NAUGHT
BEFORE HE COULD MIND TOM SLIPPED BEHIND
AND GAVE HIM THE BOOT TO LARN HIM
WARN HIM DARN HIM
A BUMP O THE BOOT ON THE SEAT TOM THOUGHT
WOULD BE THE WAY TO LARN HIM

BUT HARDER THAN STONE IS THE FLESH AND BONE
OF A TROLL THAT SITS IN THE HILLS ALONE
AS WELL SET YOUR BOOT TO THE MOUNTAINS ROOT
FOR THE SEAT OF A TROLL DONT FEEL IT
PEEL IT HEAL IT
OLD TROLL LAUGHED WHEN HE HEARD TOM GROAN
AND HE KNEW HIS TOES COULD FEEL IT

TOMS LEG IS GAME SINCE HOME HE CAME
AND HIS BOOTLESS FOOT IS LASTING LAME
BUT TROLL DONT CARE AND HES STILL THERE
WITH THE BONE HE BONED FROM ITS OWNER
DONER BONER
TROLLS OLD SEAT IS STILL THE SAME
AND THE BONE HE BONED FROM ITS OWNER

WELL THATS A WARNING TO US ALL LAUGHED MERRY IT IS AS WELL YOU USED A STICK AND NOT YOUR HAND STRIDER
WHERE DID YOU COME BY THAT SAM ASKED PIPPIN IVE NEVER HEARD THOSE WORDS BEFORE
SAM MUTTERED SOMETHING INAUDIBLE ITS OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD OF COURSE SAID FRODO I AM LEARNING A LOT ABOUT SAM GAMGEE ON THIS JOURNEY FIRST HE WAS A CONSPIRATOR NOW HES A JESTER HELL END UP BY BECOMING A WIZARD  OR A WARRIOR
I HOPE NOT SAID SAM I DONT WANT TO BE NEITHER
IN THE AFTERNOON THEY WENT ON DOWN THE WOODS THEY WERE PROBABLY FOLLOWING THE VERY TRACK THAT GANDALF BILBO AND THE DWARVES HAD USED MANY YEARS BEFORE AFTER A FEW MILES THEY CAME OUT ON THE TOP OF A HIGH BANK ABOVE THE ROAD AT THIS POINT THE ROAD HAD LEFT THE HOARWELL FAR BEHIND IN ITS NARROW VALLEY AND NOW CLUNG CLOSE TO THE FEET OF THE HILLS ROLLING AND WINDING EASTWARD AMONG WOODS AND HEATHERCOVERED SLOPES TOWARDS THE FORD AND THE MOUNTAINS NOT FAR DOWN THE BANK STRIDER POINTED OUT A STONE IN THE GRASS ON IT ROUGHLY CUT AND NOW MUCH WEATHERED COULD STILL BE SEEN DWARFRUNES AND SECRET MARKS
THERE SAID MERRY THAT MUST BE THE STONE THAT MARKED THE PLACE WHERE THE TROLLS GOLD WAS HIDDEN HOW MUCH IS LEFT OF BILBOS SHARE I WONDER FRODO
FRODO LOOKED AT THE STONE AND WISHED THAT BILBO HAD BROUGHT HOME NO TREASURE MORE PERILOUS NOR LESS EASY TO PAN WITH NONE AT ALL HE SAID BILBO GAVE IT ALL AWAY HE TOLD ME HE DID NOT FEEL IT WAS REALLY HIS AS IT CAME FROM ROBBERS
THE ROAD LAY QUIET UNDER THE LONG SHADOWS OF EARLY EVENING THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY OTHER TRAVELLERS TO BE SEEN AS THERE WAS NOW NO OTHER POSSIBLE COURSE FOR THEM TO TAKE THEY CLIMBED DOWN THE BANK AND TURNING LEFT WENT OFF AS FAST AS THEY COULD SOON A SHOULDER OF THE HILLS CUT OFF THE LIGHT OF THE FAST WESTERING SUN A COLD WIND FLOWED DOWN TO MEET THEM FROM THE MOUNTAINS AHEAD
THEY WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK OUT FOR A PLACE OFF THE ROAD WHERE THEY COULD CAMP FOR THE NIGHT WHEN THEY HEARD A SOUND THAT BROUGHT SUDDEN FEAR BACK INTO THEIR HEARTS THE NOISE OF HOOFS BEHIND THEM THEY LOOKED BACK BUT THEY COULD NOT SEE FAR BECAUSE OF THE MANY WINDINGS AND ROLLINGS OF THE ROAD AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD THEY SCRAMBLED OFF THE BEATEN WAY AND UP INTO THE DEEP HEATHER AND BILBERRY BRUSHWOOD ON THE SLOPES ABOVE UNTIL THEY CAME TO A SMALL PATCH OF THICKGROWING HAZELS AS THEY PEERED OUT FROM AMONG THE BUSHES THEY COULD SEE THE ROAD FAINT AND GREY IN THE FAILING LIGHT SOME THIRTY FEET BELOW THEM THE SOUND OF HOOFS DREW NEARER THEY WERE GOING FAST WITH A LIGHT CLIPPETYCLIPPETYCLIP THEN FAINTLY AS IF IT WAS BLOWN AWAY FROM THEM BY THE BREEZE THEY SEEMED TO CATCH A DIM RINGING AS OF SMALL BELLS TINKLING
THAT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A BLACK RIDERS HORSE SAID FRODO LISTENING INTENTLY THE OTHER HOBBITS AGREED HOPEFULLY THAT IT DID NOT BUT THEY ALL REMAINED FULL OF SUSPICION THEY HAD BEEN IN FEAR OF PURSUIT FOR SO LONG THAT ANY SOUND FROM BEHIND SEEMED OMINOUS AND UNFRIENDLY BUT STRIDER WAS NOW LEANING FORWARD STOOPED TO THE GROUND WITH A HAND TO HIS EAR AND A LOOK OF JOY ON HIS FACE
THE LIGHT FADED AND THE LEAVES ON THE BUSHES RUSTLED SOFTLY CLEARER AND NEARER NOW THE BELLS JINGLED AND CLIPPETYCLIP CAME THE QUICK TROTTING FEET SUDDENLY INTO VIEW BELOW CAME A WHITE HORSE GLEAMING IN THE SHADOWS RUNNING SWIFTLY IN THE DUSK ITS HEADSTALL FLICKERED AND FLASHED AS IF IT WERE STUDDED WITH GEMS LIKE LIVING STARS THE RIDERS CLOAK STREAMED BEHIND HIM AND HIS HOOD WAS THROWN BACK HIS GOLDEN HAIR FLOWED SHIMMERING IN THE WIND OF HIS SPEED TO FRODO IT APPEARED THAT A WHITE LIGHT WAS SHINING THROUGH THE FORM AND RAIMENT OF THE RIDER AS IF THROUGH A THIN VEIL
STRIDER SPRANG FROM HIDING AND DASHED DOWN TOWARDS THE ROAD LEAPING WITH A CRY THROUGH THE HEATHER BUT EVEN BEFORE HE HAD MOVED OR CALLED THE RIDER HAD REINED IN HIS HORSE AND HALTED LOOKING UP TOWARDS THE THICKET WHERE THEY STOOD WHEN HE SAW STRIDER HE DISMOUNTED AND RAN TO MEET HIM CALLING OUT AI NA VEDUI DUNADAN MAE GOVANNEN HIS SPEECH AND CLEAR RINGING VOICE LEFT NO DOUBT IN THEIR HEARTS THE RIDER WAS OF THE ELVENFOLK NO OTHERS THAT DWELT IN THE WIDE WORLD HAD VOICES SO FAIR TO HEAR BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE A NOTE OF HASTE OR FEAR IN HIS CALL AND THEY SAW THAT HE WAS NOW SPEAKING QUICKLY AND URGENTLY TO STRIDER
SOON STRIDER BECKONED TO THEM AND THE HOBBITS LEFT THE BUSHES AND HURRIED DOWN TO THE ROAD THIS IS GLORFINDEL WHO DWELLS IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND SAID STRIDER
HAIL AND WELL MET AT LAST SAID THE ELFLORD TO FRODO I WAS SENT FROM RIVENDELL TO LOOK FOR YOU WE FEARED THAT YOU WERE IN DANGER UPON THE ROAD
THEN GANDALF HAS REACHED RIVENDELL CRIED FRODO JOYFULLY
NO HE HAD NOT WHEN I DEPARTED BUT THAT WAS NINE DAYS AGO ANSWERED GLORFINDEL ELROND RECEIVED NEWS THAT TROUBLED HIM SOME OF MY KINDRED JOURNEYING IN YOUR LAND BEYOND THE BARANDUIN7LEARNED THAT THINGS WERE AMISS AND SENT MESSAGES AS SWIFTLY AS THEY COULD THEY SAID THAT THE NINE WERE ABROAD AND THAT YOU WERE ASTRAY BEARING A GREAT BURDEN WITHOUT GUIDANCE FOR GANDALF HAD NOT RETURNED THERE ARE FEW EVEN IN RIVENDELL THAT CAN RIDE OPENLY AGAINST THE NINE BUT SUCH AS THERE WERE ELROND SENT OUT NORTH WEST AND SOUTH IT WAS THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT TURN FAR ASIDE TO AVOID PURSUIT AND BECOME LOST IN THE WILDERNESS
IT WAS MY LOT TO TAKE THE ROAD AND I CAME TO THE BRIDGE OF MITHEITHEL AND LEFT A TOKEN THERE NIGH ON SEVEN DAYS AGO THREE OF THE SERVANTS OF SAURON WERE UPON THE BRIDGE BUT THEY WITHDREW AND I PURSUED THEM WESTWARD I CAME ALSO UPON TWO OTHERS BUT THEY TURNED AWAY SOUTHWARD SINCE THEN I HAVE SEARCHED FOR YOUR TRAIL TWO DAYS AGO I FOUND IT AND FOLLOWED IT OVER THE BRIDGE AND TODAY I MARKED WHERE YOU DESCENDED FROM THE HILLS AGAIN BUT COME THERE IS NO TIME FOR FURTHER NEWS SINCE YOU ARE HERE WE MUST RISK THE PERIL OF THE ROAD AND GO THERE ARE FIVE BEHIND US AND WHEN THEY FIND YOUR TRAIL UPON THE ROAD THEY WILL RIDE AFTER US LIKE THE WIND AND THEY ARE NOT ALL WHERE THE OTHER FOUR MAY BE I DO NOT KNOW I FEAR THAT WE MAY FIND THE FORD IS ALREADY HELD AGAINST US
WHILE GLORFINDEL WAS SPEAKING THE SHADES OF EVENING DEEPENED FRODO FELT A GREAT WEARINESS COME OVER HIM EVER SINCE THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK THE MIST BEFORE HIS EYES HAD DARKENED AND HE FELT THAT A SHADOW WAS COMING BETWEEN HIM AND THE FACES OF HIS FRIENDS NOW PAIN ASSAILED HIM AND HE FELT COLD HE SWAYED CLUTCHING AT SAMS ARM
MY MASTER IS SICK AND WOUNDED SAID SAM ANGRILY HE CANT GO ON RIDING AFTER NIGHTFALL HE NEEDS REST
GLORFINDEL CAUGHT FRODO AS HE SANK TO THE GROUND AND TAKING HIM GENTLY IN HIS ARMS HE LOOKED IN HIS FACE WITH GRAVE ANXIETY
BRIEFLY STRIDER TOLD OF THE ATTACK ON THEIR CAMP UNDER WEATHERTOP AND OF THE DEADLY KNIFE HE DREW OUT THE HILT WHICH HE HAD KEPT AND HANDED IT TO THE ELF GLORFINDEL SHUDDERED AS HE TOOK IT BUT HE LOOKED INTENTLY AT IT
THERE ARE EVIL THINGS WRITTEN ON THIS HILT HE SAID THOUGH MAYBE YOUR EYES CANNOT SEE THEM KEEP IT ARAGORN TILL WE REACH THE HOUSE OF ELROND BUT BE WARY AND HANDLE IT AS LITTLE AS YOU MAY ALAS THE WOUNDS OF THIS WEAPON ARE BEYOND MY SKILL TO HEAL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN  BUT ALL THE MORE DO I URGE YOU NOW TO GO ON WITHOUT REST
HE SEARCHED THE WOUND ON FRODOS SHOULDER WITH HIS FINGERS AND HIS FACE GREW GRAVER AS IF WHAT HE LEARNED DISQUIETED HIM BUT FRODO FELT THE CHILL LESSEN IN HIS SIDE AND ARM A LITTLE WARMTH CREPT DOWN FROM HIS SHOULDER TO HIS HAND AND THE PAIN GREW EASIER THE DUSK OF EVENING SEEMED TO GROW LIGHTER ABOUT HIM AS IF A CLOUD HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN HE SAW HIS FRIENDS FACES MORE CLEARLY AGAIN AND A MEASURE OF NEW HOPE AND STRENGTH RETURNED
YOU SHALL RIDE MY HORSE SAID GLORFINDEL I WILL SHORTEN THE STIRRUPS UP TO THE SADDLESKINS AND YOU MUST SIT AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN BUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR MY HORSE WILL NOT LET ANY RIDER FALL THAT I COMMAND HIM TO BEAR HIS PACE IS LIGHT AND SMOOTH AND IF DANGER PRESSES TOO NEAR HE WILL BEAR YOU AWAY WITH A SPEED THAT EVEN THE BLACK STEEDS OF THE ENEMY CANNOT RIVAL
NO HE WILL NOT SAID FRODO I SHALL NOT RIDE HIM IF I AM TO BE CARRIED OFF TO RIVENDELL OR ANYWHERE ELSE LEAVING MY FRIENDS BEHIND IN DANGER
GLORFINDEL SMILED I DOUBT VERY MUCH HE SAID IF YOUR FRIENDS WOULD BE IN DANGER IF YOU WERE NOT WITH THEM THE PURSUIT WOULD FOLLOW YOU AND LEAVE US IN PEACE I THINK IT IS YOU FRODO AND THAT WHICH YOU BEAR THAT BRINGS US ALL IN PERIL
TO THAT FRODO HAD NO ANSWER AND HE WAS PERSUADED TO MOUNT GLORFINDELS WHITE HORSE THE PONY WAS LADEN INSTEAD WITH A GREAT PART OF THE OTHERS BURDENS SO THAT THEY NOW MARCHED LIGHTER AND FOR A TIME MADE GOOD SPEED BUT THE HOBBITS BEGAN TO FIND IT HARD TO KEEP UP WITH THE SWIFT TIRELESS FEET OF THE ELF ON HE LED THEM INTO THE MOUTH OF DARKNESS AND STILL ON UNDER THE DEEP CLOUDED NIGHT THERE WAS NEITHER STAR NOR MOON NOT UNTIL THE GREY OF DAWN DID HE ALLOW THEM TO HALT PIPPIN MERRY AND SAM WERE BY THAT TIME NEARLY ASLEEP ON THEIR STUMBLING LEGS AND EVEN STRIDER SEEMED BY THE SAG OF HIS SHOULDERS TO BE WEARY FRODO SAT UPON THE HORSE IN A DARK DREAM
THEY CAST THEMSELVES DOWN IN THE HEATHER A FEW YARDS FROM THE ROADSIDE AND FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY THEY SEEMED HARDLY TO HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES WHEN GLORFINDEL WHO HAD SET HIMSELF TO WATCH WHILE THEY SLEPT AWOKE THEM AGAIN THE SUN HAD NOW CLIMBED FAR INTO THE MORNING AND THE CLOUDS AND MISTS OF THE NIGHT WERE GONE
DRINK THIS SAID GLORFINDEL TO THEM POURING FOR EACH IN TURN A LITTLE LIQUOR FROM HIS SILVERSTUDDED FLASK OF LEATHER IT WAS CLEAR AS SPRING WATER AND HAD NO TASTE AND IT DID NOT FEEL EITHER COOL OR WARM IN THE MOUTH BUT STRENGTH AND VIGOUR SEEMED TO FLOW INTO ALL THEIR LIMBS AS THEY DRANK IT EATEN AFTER THAT DRAUGHT THE STALE BREAD AND DRIED FRUIT WHICH WAS NOW ALL THAT THEY HAD LEFT SEEMED TO SATISFY THEIR HUNGER BETTER THAN MANY A GOOD BREAKFAST IN THE SHIRE HAD DONE
THEY HAD RESTED RATHER LESS THAN FIVE HOURS WHEN THEY TOOK TO THE ROAD AGAIN GLORFINDEL STILL URGED THEM ON AND ONLY ALLOWED TWO BRIEF HALTS DURING THE DAYS MARCH IN THIS WAY THEY COVERED ALMOST TWENTY MILES BEFORE NIGHTFALL AND CAME TO A POINT WHERE THE ROAD BENT RIGHT AND RAN DOWN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY NOW MAKING STRAIGHT FOR THE BRUINEN SO FAR THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGN OR SOUND OF PURSUIT THAT THE HOBBITS COULD SEE OR HEAR BUT OFTEN GLORFINDEL WOULD HALT AND LISTEN FOR A MOMENT IF THEY LAGGED BEHIND AND A LOOK OF ANXIETY CLOUDED HIS FACE ONCE OR TWICE HE SPOKE TO STRIDER IN THE ELFTONGUE
BUT HOWEVER ANXIOUS THEIR GUIDES MIGHT BE IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE HOBBITS COULD GO NO FURTHER THAT NIGHT THEY WERE STUMBLING ALONG DIZZY WITH WEARINESS AND UNABLE TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT THEIR FEET AND LEGS FRODOS PAIN HAD REDOUBLED AND DURING THE DAY THINGS ABOUT HIM FADED TO SHADOWS OF GHOSTLY GREY HE ALMOST WELCOMED THE COMING OF NIGHT FOR THEN THE WORLD SEEMED LESS PALE AND EMPTY
THE HOBBITS WERE STILL WEARY WHEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN EARLY NEXT MORNING THERE WERE MANY MILES YET TO GO BETWEEN THEM AND THE FORD AND THEY HOBBLED FORWARD AT THE BEST PACE THEY COULD MANAGE
OUR PERIL WILL BE GREATEST JUST ERE WE REACH THE RIVER SAID GLORFINDEL FOR MY HEART WARNS ME THAT THE PURSUIT IS NOW SWIFT BEHIND US AND OTHER DANGER MAY BE WAITING BY THE FORD
THE ROAD WAS STILL RUNNING STEADILY DOWNHILL AND THERE WAS NOW IN PLACES MUCH GRASS AT EITHER SIDE IN WHICH THE HOBBITS WALKED WHEN THEY COULD TO EASE THEIR TIRED FEET IN THE LATE AFTERNOON THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE ROAD WENT SUDDENLY UNDER THE DARK SHADOW OF TALL PINETREES AND THEN PLUNGED INTO A DEEP CUTTING WITH STEEP MOIST WALLS OF RED STONE ECHOES RAN ALONG AS THEY HURRIED FORWARD AND THERE SEEMED TO BE A SOUND OF MANY FOOTFALLS FOLLOWING THEIR OWN ALL AT ONCE AS IF THROUGH A GATE OF LIGHT THE ROAD RAN OUT AGAIN FROM THE END OF THE TUNNEL INTO THE OPEN THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF A SHARP INCLINE THEY SAW BEFORE THEM A LONG FLAT MILE AND BEYOND THAT THE FORD OF RIVENDELL ON THE FURTHER SIDE WAS A STEEP BROWN BANK THREADED BY A WINDING PATH AND BEHIND THAT THE TALL MOUNTAINS CLIMBED SHOULDER ABOVE SHOULDER AND PEAK BEYOND PEAK INTO THE FADING SKY
THERE WAS STILL AN ECHO AS OF FOLLOWING FEET IN THE CUTTING BEHIND THEM A RUSHING NOISE AS IF A WIND WERE RISING AND POURING THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE PINES ONE MOMENT GLORFINDEL TURNED AND LISTENED THEN HE SPRANG FORWARD WITH A LOUD CRY
FLY HE CALLED FLY THE ENEMY IS UPON US
THE WHITE HORSE LEAPED FORWARD THE HOBBITS RAN DOWN THE SLOPE GLORFINDEL AND STRIDER FOLLOWED AS REARGUARD THEY WERE ONLY HALF WAY ACROSS THE FLAT WHEN SUDDENLY THERE WAS A NOISE OF HORSES GALLOPING OUT OF THE GATE IN THE TREES THAT THEY HAD JUST LEFT RODE A BLACK RIDER HE REINED HIS HORSE IN AND HALTED SWAYING IN HIS SADDLE ANOTHER FOLLOWED HIM AND THEN ANOTHER THEN AGAIN TWO MORE
RIDE FORWARD RIDE CRIED GLORFINDEL TO FRODO
HE DID NOT OBEY AT ONCE FOR A STRANGE RELUCTANCE SEIZED HIM CHECKING THE HORSE TO A WALK HE TURNED AND LOOKED BACK THE RIDERS SEEMED TO SIT UPON THEIR GREAT STEEDS LIKE THREATENING STATUES UPON A HILL DARK AND SOLID WHILE ALL THE WOODS AND LAND ABOUT THEM RECEDED AS IF INTO A MIST SUDDENLY HE KNEW IN HIS HEART THAT THEY WERE SILENTLY COMMANDING HIM TO WAIT THEN AT ONCE FEAR AND HATRED AWOKE IN HIM HIS HAND LEFT THE BRIDLE AND GRIPPED THE HILT OF HIS SWORD AND WITH A RED FLASH HE DREW IT
RIDE ON RIDE ON CRIED GLORFINDEL AND THEN LOUD AND CLEAR HE CALLED TO THE HORSE IN THE ELFTONGUE NORO LIM NORO LIM ASFALOTH
AT ONCE THE WHITE HORSE SPRANG AWAY AND SPED LIKE THE WIND ALONG THE LAST LAP OF THE ROAD AT THE SAME MOMENT THE BLACK HORSES LEAPED DOWN THE HILL IN PURSUIT AND FROM THE RIDERS CAME A TERRIBLE CRY SUCH AS FRODO HAD HEARD FILLING THE WOODS WITH HORROR IN THE EASTFARTHING FAR AWAY IT WAS ANSWERED AND TO THE DISMAY OF FRODO AND HIS FRIENDS OUT FROM THE TREES AND ROCKS AWAY ON THE LEFT FOUR OTHER RIDERS CAME FLYING TWO RODE TOWARDS FRODO TWO GALLOPED MADLY TOWARDS THE FORD TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE THEY SEEMED TO HIM TO RUN LIKE THE WIND AND TO GROW SWIFTLY LARGER AND DARKER AS THEIR COURSES CONVERGED WITH HIS
FRODO LOOKED BACK FOR A MOMENT OVER HIS SHOULDER HE COULD NO LONGER SEE HIS FRIENDS THE RIDERS BEHIND WERE FALLING BACK EVEN THEIR GREAT STEEDS WERE NO MATCH IN SPEED FOR THE WHITE ELFHORSE OF GLORFINDEL HE LOOKED FORWARD AGAIN AND HOPE FADED THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF REACHING THE FORD BEFORE HE WAS CUT OFF BY THE OTHERS THAT HAD LAIN IN AMBUSH HE COULD SEE THEM CLEARLY NOW THEY APPEARED TO HAVE CAST ASIDE THEIR HOODS AND BLACK CLOAKS AND THEY WERE ROBED IN WHITE AND GREY SWORDS WERE NAKED IN THEIR PALE HANDS HELMS WERE ON THEIR HEADS THEIR COLD EYES GLITTERED AND THEY CALLED TO HIM WITH FELL VOICES
FEAR NOW FILLED ALL FRODOS MIND HE THOUGHT NO LONGER OF HIS SWORD NO CRY CAME FROM HIM HE SHUT HIS EYES AND CLUNG TO THE HORSES MANE THE WIND WHISTLED IN HIS EARS AND THE BELLS UPON THE HARNESS RANG WILD AND SHRILL A BREATH OF DEADLY COLD PIERCED HIM LIKE A SPEAR AS WITH A LAST SPURT LIKE A FLASH OF WHITE FIRE THE ELFHORSE SPEEDING AS IF ON WINGS PASSED RIGHT BEFORE THE FACE OF THE FOREMOST RIDER
FRODO HEARD THE SPLASH OF WATER IT FOAMED ABOUT HIS FEET HE FELT THE QUICK HEAVE AND SURGE AS THE HORSE LEFT THE RIVER AND STRUGGLED UP THE STONY PATH HE WAS CLIMBING THE STEEP BANK HE WAS ACROSS THE FORD
BUT THE PURSUERS WERE CLOSE BEHIND AT THE TOP OF THE BANK THE HORSE HALTED AND TURNED ABOUT NEIGHING FIERCELY THERE WERE NINE RIDERS AT THE WATERS EDGE BELOW AND FRODOS SPIRIT QUAILED BEFORE THE THREAT OF THEIR UPLIFTED FACES HE KNEW OF NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM CROSSING AS EASILY AS HE HAD DONE AND HE FELT THAT IT WAS USELESS TO TRY TO ESCAPE OVER THE LONG UNCERTAIN PATH FROM THE FORD TO THE EDGE OF RIVENDELL IF ONCE THE RIDERS CROSSED IN ANY CASE HE FELT THAT HE WAS COMMANDED URGENTLY TO HALT HATRED AGAIN STIRRED IN HIM BUT HE HAD NO LONGER THE STRENGTH TO REFUSE
SUDDENLY THE FOREMOST RIDER SPURRED HIS HORSE FORWARD IT CHECKED AT THE WATER AND REARED UP WITH A GREAT EFFORT FRODO SAT UPRIGHT AND BRANDISHED HIS SWORD
GO BACK HE CRIED GO BACK TO THE LAND OF MORDOR AND FOLLOW ME NO MORE HIS VOICE SOUNDED THIN AND SHRILL IN HIS OWN EARS THE RIDERS HALTED BUT FRODO HAD NOT THE POWER OF BOMBADIL HIS ENEMIES LAUGHED AT HIM WITH A HARSH AND CHILLING LAUGHTER
COME BACK COME BACK THEY CALLED TO MORDOR WE WILL TAKE YOU
GO BACK HE WHISPERED
THE RING THE RING THEY CRIED WITH DEADLY VOICES AND IMMEDIATELY THEIR LEADER URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD INTO THE WATER FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY TWO OTHERS
BY ELBERETH AND LUTHIEN THE FAIR SAID FRODO WITH A LAST EFFORT LIFTING UP HIS SWORD YOU SHALL HAVE NEITHER THE RING NOR ME
THEN THE LEADER WHO WAS NOW HALF ACROSS THE FORD STOOD UP MENACING IN HIS STIRRUPS AND RAISED UP HIS HAND FRODO WAS STRICKEN DUMB HE FELT HIS TONGUE CLEAVE TO HIS MOUTH AND HIS HEART LABOURING HIS SWORD BROKE AND FELL OUT OF HIS SHAKING HAND THE ELFHORSE REARED AND SNORTED THE FOREMOST OF THE BLACK HORSES HAD ALMOST SET FOOT UPON THE SHORE
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A ROARING AND A RUSHING A NOISE OF LOUD WATERS ROLLING MANY STONES DIMLY FRODO SAW THE RIVER BELOW HIM RISE AND DOWN ALONG ITS COURSE THERE CAME A PLUMED CAVALRY OF WAVES WHITE FLAMES SEEMED TO FRODO TO FLICKER ON THEIR CRESTS AND HE HALF FANCIED THAT HE SAW AMID THE WATER WHITE RIDERS UPON WHITE HORSES WITH FROTHING MANES THE THREE RIDERS THAT WERE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE FORD WERE OVERWHELMED THEY DISAPPEARED BURIED SUDDENLY UNDER ANGRY FOAM THOSE THAT WERE BEHIND DREW BACK IN DISMAY
WITH HIS LAST FAILING SENSES FRODO HEARD CRIES AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE SAW BEYOND THE RIDERS THAT HESITATED ON THE SHORE A SHINING FIGURE OF WHITE LIGHT AND BEHIND IT RAN SMALL SHADOWY FORMS WAVING FLAMES THAT FLARED RED IN THE GREY MIST THAT WAS FALLING OVER THE WORLD
THE BLACK HORSES WERE FILLED WITH MADNESS AND LEAPING FORWARD IN TERROR THEY BORE THEIR RIDERS INTO THE RUSHING FLOOD THEIR PIERCING CRIES WERE DROWNED IN THE ROARING OF THE RIVER AS IT CARRIED THEM AWAY THEN FRODO FELT HIMSELF FALLING AND THE ROARING AND CONFUSION SEEMED TO RISE AND ENGULF HIM TOGETHER WITH HIS ENEMIES HE HEARD AND SAW NO MORE




BOOK II



CHAPTER 1
MANY MEETINGS

FRODO WOKE AND FOUND HIMSELF LYING IN BED AT FIRST HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SLEPT LATE AFTER A LONG UNPLEASANT DREAM THAT STILL HOVERED ON THE EDGE OF MEMORY OR PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN ILL BUT THE CEILING LOOKED STRANGE IT WAS FLAT AND IT HAD DARK BEAMS RICHLY CARVED HE LAY A LITTLE WHILE LONGER LOOKING AT PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT ON THE WALL AND LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF A WATERFALL
WHERE AM I AND WHAT IS THE TIME HE SAID ALOUD TO THE CEILING IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND AND IT IS TEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING SAID A VOICE IT IS THE MORNING OF OCTOBER THE TWENTYFOURTH IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
GANDALF CRIED FRODO SITTING UP THERE WAS THE OLD WIZARD SITTING IN A CHAIR BY THE OPEN WINDOW
YES HE SAID I AM HERE AND YOU ARE LUCKY TO BE HERE TOO AFTER ALL THE ABSURD THINGS YOU HAVE DONE SINCE YOU LEFT HOME
FRODO LAY DOWN AGAIN HE FELT TOO COMFORTABLE AND PEACEFUL TO ARGUE AND IN ANY CASE HE DID NOT THINK HE WOULD GET THE BETTER OF AN ARGUMENT HE WAS FULLY AWAKE NOW AND THE MEMORY OF HIS JOURNEY WAS RETURNING THE DISASTROUS SHORT CUT THROUGH THE OLD FOREST THE ACCIDENT AT THE PRANCING PONY AND HIS MADNESS IN PUTTING ON THE RING IN THE DELL UNDER WEATHERTOP WHILE HE WAS THINKING OF ALL THESE THINGS AND TRYING IN VAIN TO BRING HIS MEMORY DOWN TO HIS ARRIVING IN RIVENDELL THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE SOFT PUFFS OF GANDALFS PIPE AS HE BLEW WHITE SMOKERINGS OUT OF THE WINDOW
WHERES SAM FRODO ASKED AT LENGTH AND ARE THE OTHERS ALL RIGHT
YES THEY ARE ALL SAFE AND SOUND ANSWERED GANDALF SAM WAS HERE UNTIL I SENT HIM OFF TO GET SOME REST ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FORD SAID FRODO IT ALL SEEMED SO DIM SOMEHOW AND IT STILL DOES
YES IT WOULD YOU WERE BEGINNING TO FADE ANSWERED GANDALF THE WOUND WAS OVERCOMING YOU AT LAST A FEW MORE HOURS AND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BEYOND OUR AID BUT YOU HAVE SOME STRENGTH IN YOU MY DEAR HOBBIT AS YOU SHOWED IN THE BARROW THAT WAS TOUCH AND GO PERHAPS THE MOST DANGEROUS MOMENT OF ALL I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HELD OUT AT WEATHERTOP
YOU SEEM TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ALREADY SAID FRODO I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO THE OTHERS ABOUT THE BARROW AT FIRST IT WAS TOO HORRIBLE AND AFTERWARDS THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT
YOU HAVE TALKED LONG IN YOUR SLEEP FRODO SAID GANDALF GENTLY AND IT HAS NOT BEEN HARD FOR ME TO READ YOUR MIND AND MEMORY DO NOT WORRY THOUGH I SAID ABSURD JUST NOW I DID NOT MEAN IT I THINK WELL OF YOU  AND OF THE OTHERS IT IS NO SMALL FEAT TO HAVE COME SO FAR AND THROUGH SUCH DANGERS STILL BEARING THE RING
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT STRIDER SAID FRODO BUT WE NEEDED YOU I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHOUT YOU
I WAS DELAYED SAID GANDALF AND THAT NEARLY PROVED OUR RUIN AND YET I AM NOT SURE IT MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER SO
I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
ALL IN GOOD TIME YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK OR WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING TODAY BY ELRONDS ORDERS
BUT TALKING WOULD STOP ME THINKING AND WONDERING WHICH ARE QUITE AS TIRING SAID FRODO I AM WIDE AWAKE NOW AND I REMEMBER SO MANY THINGS THAT WANT EXPLAINING WHY WERE YOU DELAYED YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME THAT AT LEAST
YOU WILL SOON HEAR ALL YOU WISH TO KNOW SAID GANDALF WE SHALL HAVE A COUNCIL AS SOON AS YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT I WILL ONLY SAY THAT I WAS HELD CAPTIVE
YOU CRIED FRODO
YES I GANDALF THE GREY SAID THE WIZARD SOLEMNLY THERE ARE MANY POWERS IN THE WORLD FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL SOME ARE GREATER THAN I AM AGAINST SOME I HAVE NOT YET BEEN MEASURED BUT MY TIME IS COMING THE MORGULLORD AND HIS BLACK RIDERS HAVE COME FORTH WAR IS PREPARING
THEN YOU KNEW OF THE RIDERS ALREADYBEFORE I MET THEM
YES I KNEW OF THEM INDEED I SPOKE OF THEM ONCE TO YOU FOR THE BLACK RIDERS ARE THE RINGWRAITHS THE NINE SERVANTS OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS BUT I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY HAD ARISEN AGAIN OR I SHOULD HAVE FLED WITH YOU AT ONCE I HEARD NEWS OF THEM ONLY AFTER I LEFT YOU IN JUNE BUT THAT STORY MUST WAIT FOR THE MOMENT WE HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM DISASTER BY ARAGORN
YES SAID FRODO IT WAS STRIDER THAT SAVED US YET I WAS AFRAID OF HIM AT FIRST SAM NEVER QUITE TRUSTED HIM I THINK NOT AT ANY RATE UNTIL WE MET GLORFINDEL
GANDALF SMILED I HAVE HEARD ALL ABOUT SAM HE SAID HE HAS NO MORE DOUBTS NOW
I AM GLAD SAID FRODO FOR I HAVE BECOME VERY FOND OF STRIDER WELL FOND IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD I MEAN HE IS DEAR TO ME THOUGH HE IS STRANGE AND GRIM AT TIMES IN FACT HE REMINDS ME OFTEN OF YOU I DIDNT KNOW THAT ANY OF THE BIG PEOPLE WERE LIKE THAT I THOUGHT WELL THAT THEY WERE JUST BIG AND RATHER STUPID KIND AND STUPID LIKE BUTTERBUR OR STUPID AND WICKED LIKE BILL FERNY BUT THEN WE DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT MEN IN THE SHIRE EXCEPT PERHAPS THE BREELANDERS
YOU DONT KNOW MUCH EVEN ABOUT THEM IF YOU THINK OLD BARLIMAN IS STUPID SAID GANDALF HE IS WISE ENOUGH ON HIS OWN GROUND HE THINKS LESS THAN HE TALKS AND SLOWER YET HE CAN SEE THROUGH A BRICK WALL IN TIME AS THEY SAY IN BREE BUT THERE ARE FEW LEFT IN MIDDLEEARTH LIKE ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN THE RACE OF THE KINGS FROM OVER THE SEA IS NEARLY AT AN END IT MAY BE THAT THIS WAR OF THE RING WILL BE THEIR LAST ADVENTURE
DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT STRIDER IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE OLD KINGS SAID FRODO IN WONDER I THOUGHT THEY HAD ALL VANISHED LONG AGO I THOUGHT HE WAS ONLY A RANGER
ONLY A RANGER CRIED GANDALF MY DEAR FRODO THAT IS JUST WHAT THE RANGERS ARE THE LAST REMNANT IN THE NORTH OF THE GREAT PEOPLE THE MEN OF THE WEST THEY HAVE HELPED ME BEFORE AND I SHALL NEED THEIR HELP IN THE DAYS TO COME FOR WE HAVE REACHED RIVENDELL BUT THE RING IS NOT YET AT REST
I SUPPOSE NOT SAID FRODO BUT SO FAR MY ONLY THOUGHT HAS BEEN TO GET HERE AND I HOPE I SHANT HAVE TO GO ANY FURTHER IT IS VERY PLEASANT JUST TO REST I HAVE HAD A MONTH OF EXILE AND ADVENTURE AND I FIND THAT HAS BEEN AS MUCH AS I WANT
HE FELL SILENT AND SHUT HIS EYES AFTER A WHILE HE SPOKE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN RECKONING HE SAID AND I CANT BRING THE TOTAL UP TO OCTOBER THE TWENTYFOURTH IT OUGHT TO BE THE TWENTYFIRST WE MUST HAVE REACHED THE FORD BY THE TWENTIETH
YOU HAVE TALKED AND RECKONED MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR YOU SAID GANDALF HOW DO THE SIDE AND SHOULDER FEEL NOW
I DONT KNOW FRODO ANSWERED THEY DONT FEEL AT ALL WHICH IS AN IMPROVEMENT BUTHE MADE AN EFFORTI CAN MOVE MY ARM AGAIN A LITTLE YES IT IS COMING BACK TO LIFE IT IS NOT COLD HE ADDED TOUCHING HIS LEFT HAND WITH HIS RIGHT
GOOD SAID GANDALF IT IS MENDING FAST YOU WILL SOON BE SOUND AGAIN ELROND HAS CURED YOU HE HAS TENDED YOU FOR DAYS EVER SINCE YOU WERE BROUGHT IN
DAYS SAID FRODO
WELL FOUR NIGHTS AND THREE DAYS TO BE EXACT THE ELVES BROUGHT YOU FROM THIS WHERE YOU LOST COUNT WE HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY ANXIOUS AND SAM HAS HARDLY LEFT YOUR SIDE DAY OR NIGHT EXCEPT TO RUN MESSAGES ELROND IS A MASTER OF HEALING BUT THE WEAPONS OF OUR ENEMY ARE DEADLY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I HAD VERY LITTLE HOPE FOR I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS SOME FRAGMENT OF THE BLADE STILL IN THE CLOSED WOUND BUT IT COULD NOT BE FOUND UNTIL LAST NIGHT THEN ELROND REMOVED A SPLINTER IT WAS DEEPLY BURIED AND IT WAS WORKING INWARDS
FRODO SHUDDERED REMEMBERING THE CRUEL KNIFE WITH NOTCHED BLADE THAT HAD VANISHED IN STRIDERS HANDS DONT BE ALARMED SAID GANDALF IT IS GONE NOW IT HAS BEEN MELTED AND IT SEEMS THAT HOBBITS FADE VERY RELUCTANTLY I HAVE KNOWN STRONG WARRIORS OF THE BIG PEOPLE WHO WOULD QUICKLY HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BY THAT SPLINTER WHICH YOU BORE FOR SEVENTEEN DAYS
WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE DONE TO ME ASKED FRODO WHAT WERE THE RIDERS TRYING TO DO
THEY TRIED TO PIERCE YOUR HEART WITH A MORGULKNIFE WHICH REMAINS IN THE WOUND IF THEY HAD SUCCEEDED YOU WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE THEY ARE ONLY WEAKER AND UNDER THEIR COMMAND YOU WOULD HAVE BECAME A WRAITH UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE DARK LORD AND HE WOULD HAVE TORMENTED YOU FOR TRYING TO KEEP HIS RING IF ANY GREATER TORMENT WERE POSSIBLE THAN BEING ROBBED OF IT AND SEEING IT ON HIS HAND
THANK GOODNESS I DID NOT REALIZE THE HORRIBLE DANGER SAID FRODO FAINTLY I WAS MORTALLY AFRAID OF COURSE BUT IF I HAD KNOWN MORE I SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED EVEN TO MOVE IT IS A MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED
YES FORTUNE OR FATE HAVE HELPED YOU SAID GANDALF NOT TO MENTION COURAGE FOR YOUR HEART WAS NOT TOUCHED AND ONLY YOUR SHOULDER WAS PIERCED AND THAT WAS BECAUSE YOU RESISTED TO THE LAST BUT IT WAS A TERRIBLY NARROW SHAVE SO TO SPEAK YOU WERE IN GRAVEST PERIL WHILE YOU WORE THE RING FOR THEN YOU WERE HALF IN THE WRAITHWORLD YOURSELF AND THEY MIGHT HAVE SEIZED YOU YOU COULD SEE THEM AND THEY COULD SEE YOU
I KNOW SAID FRODO THEY WERE TERRIBLE TO BEHOLD BUT WHY COULD WE ALL SEE THEIR HORSES
BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL HORSES JUST AS THE BLACK ROBES ARE REAL ROBES THAT THEY WEAR TO GIVE SHAPE TO THEIR NOTHINGNESS WHEN THEY HAVE DEALINGS WITH THE LIVING
THEN WHY DO THESE BLACK HORSES ENDURE SUCH RIDERS ALL OTHER ANIMALS ARE TERRIFIED WHEN THEY DRAW NEAR EVEN THE ELFHORSE OF GLORFINDEL THE DOGS HOWL AND THE GEESE SCREAM AT THEM
BECAUSE THESE HORSES ARE BORN AND BRED TO THE SERVICE OF THE DARK LORD IN MORDOR NOT ALL HIS SERVANTS AND CHATTELS ARE WRAITHS THERE ARE ORCS AND TROLLS THERE ARE WARGS AND WEREWOLVES AND THERE HAVE BEEN AND STILL ARE MANY MEN WARRIORS AND KINGS THAT WALK ALIVE UNDER THE SUN AND YET ARE UNDER HIS SWAY AND THEIR NUMBER IS GROWING DAILY
WHAT ABOUT RIVENDELL AND THE ELVES IS RIVENDELL SAFE
YES AT PRESENT UNTIL ALL ELSE IS CONQUERED THE ELVES MAY FEAR THE DARK LORD AND THEY MAY FLY BEFORE HIM BUT NEVER AGAIN WILL THEY LISTEN TO HIM OR SERVE HIM AND HERE IN RIVENDELL THERE LIVE STILL SOME OF HIS CHIEF FOES THE ELVENWISE LORDS OF THE ELDAR FROM BEYOND THE FURTHEST SEAS THEY DO NOT FEAR THE RINGWRAITHS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DWELT IN THE BLESSED REALM LIVE AT ONCE IN BOTH WORLDS AND AGAINST BOTH THE SEEN AND THE UNSEEN THEY HAVE GREAT POWER
I THOUGHT THAT I SAW A WHITE FIGURE THAT SHONE AND DID NOT GROW DIM LIKE THE OTHERS WAS THAT GLORFINDEL THEN
YES YOU SAW HIM FOR A MOMENT AS HE IS UPON THE OTHER SIDE ONE OF THE MIGHTY OF THE FIRSTBORN HE IS AN ELFLORD OF A HOUSE OF PRINCES INDEED THERE IS A POWER IN RIVENDELL TO WITHSTAND THE MIGHT OF MORDOR FOR A WHILE AND ELSEWHERE OTHER POWERS STILL DWELL THERE IS POWER TOO OF ANOTHER KIND IN THE SHIRE BUT ALL SUCH PLACES WILL SOON BECOME ISLANDS UNDER SIEGE IF THINGS GO ON AS THEY ARE GOING THE DARK LORD IS PUTTING FORTH ALL HIS STRENGTH
STILL HE SAID STANDING SUDDENLY UP AND STICKING OUT HIS CHIN WHILE HIS BEARD WENT STIFF AND STRAIGHT LIKE BRISTLING WIRE WE MUST KEEP UP OUR COURAGE YOU WILL SOON BE WELL IF I DO NOT TALK YOU TO DEATH YOU ARE IN RIVENDELL AND YOU NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING FOR THE PRESENT
I HAVENT ANY COURAGE TO KEEP UP SAID FRODO BUT I AM NOT WORRIED AT THE MOMENT JUST GIVE ME NEWS OF MY FRIENDS AND TELL ME THE END OF THE AFFAIR AT THE FORD AS I KEEP ON ASKING AND I SHALL BE CONTENT FOR THE PRESENT AFTER THAT I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER SLEEP I THINK BUT I SHANT BE ABLE TO CLOSE MY EYES UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE STORY FOR ME
GANDALF MOVED HIS CHAIR TO THE BEDSIDE AND TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT FRODO THE COLOUR HAD COME BACK TO HIS FACE AND HIS EYES WERE CLEAR AND FULLY AWAKE AND AWARE HE WAS SMILING AND THERE SEEMED TO BE LITTLE WRONG WITH HIM BUT TO THE WIZARDS EYE THERE WAS A FAINT CHANGE JUST A HINT AS IT WERE OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HIM AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE LEFT HAND THAT LAY OUTSIDE UPON THE COVERLET
STILL THAT MUST BE EXPECTED SAID GANDALF TO HIMSELF HE IS NOT HALF THROUGH YET AND TO WHAT HE WILL COME IN THE END NOT EVEN ELROND CAN FORETELL NOT TO EVIL I THINK HE MAY BECOME LIKE A GLASS FILLED WITH A CLEAR LIGHT FOR EYES TO SEE THAT CAN
YOU LOOK SPLENDID HE SAID ALOUD I WILL RISK A BRIEF TALE WITHOUT CONSULTING ELROND BUT QUITE BRIEF MIND YOU AND THEN YOU MUST SLEEP AGAIN THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED AS FAR AS I CAN GATHER THE RIDERS MADE STRAIGHT FOR YOU AS SOON AS YOU FLED THEY DID NOT NEED THE GUIDANCE OF THEIR HORSES ANY LONGER YOU HAD BECOME VISIBLE TO THEM BEING ALREADY ON THE THRESHOLD OF THEIR WORLD AND ALSO THE RING DREW THEM YOUR FRIENDS SPRANG ASIDE OFF THE ROAD OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDDEN DOWN THEY KNEW THAT NOTHING COULD SAVE YOU IF THE WHITE HORSE COULD NOT THE RIDERS WERE TOO SWIFT TO OVERTAKE AND TOO MANY TO OPPOSE ON FOOT EVEN GLORFINDEL AND ARAGORN TOGETHER COULD NOT WITHSTAND ALL THE NINE AT ONCE
WHEN THE RINGWRAITHS SWEPT BY YOUR FRIENDS RAN UP BEHIND CLOSE TO THE FORD THERE IS A SMALL HOLLOW BESIDE THE ROAD MASKED BY A FEW STUNTED TREES THERE THEY HASTILY KINDLED FIRE FOR GLORFINDEL KNEW THAT A FLOOD WOULD COME DOWN IF THE RIDERS TRIED TO CROSS AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANY THAT WERE LEFT ON HIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THE MOMENT THE FLOOD APPEARED HE RUSHED OUT FOLLOWED BY ARAGORN AND THE OTHERS WITH FLAMING BRANDS CAUGHT BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER AND SEEING AN ELFLORD REVEALED IN HIS WRATH THEY WERE DISMAYED AND THEIR HORSES WERE STRICKEN WITH MADNESS THREE WERE CARRIED AWAY BY THE FIRST ASSAULT OF THE FLOOD THE OTHERS WERE NOW HURLED INTO THE WATER BY THEIR HORSES AND OVERWHELMED
AND IS THAT THE END OF THE BLACK RIDERS ASKED FRODO
NO SAID GANDALF THEIR HORSES MUST HAVE PERISHED AND WITHOUT THEM THEY ARE CRIPPLED BUT THE RINGWRAITHS THEMSELVES CANNOT BE SO EASILY DESTROYED HOWEVER THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO FEAR FROM THEM AT PRESENT YOUR FRIENDS CROSSED AFTER THE FLOOD HAD PASSED AND THEY FOUND YOU LYING ON YOUR FACE AT THE TOP OF THE BANK WITH A BROKEN SWORD UNDER YOU THE HORSE WAS STANDING GUARD BESIDE YOU YOU WERE PALE AND COLD AND THEY FEARED THAT YOU WERE DEAD OR WORSE ELRONDS FOLK MET THEM CARRYING YOU SLOWLY TOWARDS RIVENDELL
WHO MADE THE FLOOD ASKED FRODO
ELROND COMMANDED IT ANSWERED GANDALF THE RIVER OF THIS VALLEY IS UNDER HIS POWER AND IT WILL RISE IN ANGER WHEN HE HAS GREAT NEED TO BAR THE FORD AS SOON AS THE CAPTAIN OF THE RINGWRAITHS RODE INTO THE WATER THE FLOOD WAS RELEASED IF I MAY SAY SO I ADDED A FEW TOUCHES OF MY OWN YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED BUT SOME OF THE WAVES TOOK THE FORM OF GREAT WHITE HORSES WITH SHINING WHITE RIDERS AND THERE WERE MANY ROLLING AND GRINDING BOULDERS FOR A MOMENT I WAS AFRAID THAT WE HAD LET LOOSE TOO FIERCE A WRATH AND THE FLOOD WOULD GET OUT OF HAND AND WASH YOU ALL AWAY THERE IS GREAT VIGOUR IN THE WATERS THAT COME DOWN FROM THE SNOWS OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS
YES IT ALL COMES BACK TO ME NOW SAID FRODO THE TREMENDOUS ROARING I THOUGHT I WAS DROWNING WITH MY FRIENDS AND ENEMIES AND ALL BUT NOW WE ARE SAFE
GANDALF LOOKED QUICKLY AT FRODO BUT HE HAD SHUT HIS EYES YES YOU ARE ALL SAFE FOR THE PRESENT SOON THERE WILL BE FEASTING AND MERRYMAKING TO CELEBRATE THE VICTORY AT THE FORD OF BRUINEN AND YOU WILL ALL BE THERE IN PLACES OF HONOUR
SPLENDID SAID FRODO IT IS WONDERFUL THAT ELROND AND GLORFINDEL AND SUCH GREAT LORDS NOT TO MENTION STRIDER SHOULD TAKE SO MUCH TROUBLE AND SHOW ME SO MUCH KINDNESS
WELL THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THEY SHOULD SAID GANDALF SMILING I AM ONE GOOD REASON THE RING IS ANOTHER YOU ARE THE RINGBEARER AND YOU ARE THE HEIR OF BILBO THE RINGFINDER
DEAR BILBO SAID FRODO SLEEPILY I WONDER WHERE HE IS I WISH HE WAS HERE AND COULD HEAR ALL ABOUT IT IT WOULD HAVE MADE HIM LAUGH THE COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON AND THE POOR OLD TROLL WITH THAT HE FELL FAST ASLEEP
FRODO WAS NOW SAFE IN THE LAST HOMELY HOUSE EAST OF THE SEA THAT HOUSE WAS AS BILBO HAD LONG AGO REPORTED A PERFECT HOUSE WHETHER YOU LIKE FOOD OR SLEEP OR STORYTELLING OR SINGING OR JUST SITTING AND THINKING BEST OR A PLEASANT MIXTURE OF THEM ALL MERELY TO BE THERE WAS A CURE FOR WEARINESS FEAR AND SADNESS
AS THE EVENING DREW ON FRODO WOKE UP AGAIN AND HE FOUND THAT HE NO LONGER FELT IN NEED OF REST OR SLEEP BUT HAD A MIND FOR FOOD AND DRINK AND PROBABLY FOR SINGING AND STORYTELLING AFTERWARDS HE GOT OUT OF BED AND DISCOVERED THAT HIS ARM WAS ALREADY NEARLY AS USEFUL AGAIN AS IT EVER HAD BEEN HE FOUND LAID READY CLEAN GARMENTS OF GREEN CLOTH THAT FITTED HIM EXCELLENTLY LOOKING IN A MIRROR HE WAS STARTLED TO SEE A MUCH THINNER REFLECTION OF HIMSELF THAN HE REMEMBERED IT LOOKED REMARKABLY LIKE THE YOUNG NEPHEW OF BILBO WHO USED TO GO TRAMPING WITH HIS UNCLE IN THE SHIRE BUT THE EYES LOOKED OUT AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY
YES YOU HAVE SEEN A THING OR TWO SINCE YOU LAST PEEPED OUT OF A LOOKINGGLASS HE SAID TO HIS REFLECTION BUT NOW FOR A MERRY MEETING
HE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS AND WHISTLED A TUNE
AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAM CAME IN HE RAN TO FRODO AND TOOK HIS LEFT HAND AWKWARDLY AND SHYLY HE STROKED IT GENTLY AND THEN HE BLUSHED AND TURNED HASTILY AWAY
HULLO SAM SAID FRODO
ITS WARM SAID SAM MEANING YOUR HAND MR FRODO IT HAS FELT SO COLD THROUGH THE LONG NIGHTS BUT GLORY AND TRUMPETS HE CRIED TURNING ROUND AGAIN WITH SHINING EYES AND DANCING ON THE FLOOR ITS FINE TO SEE YOU UP AND YOURSELF AGAIN SIR GANDALF ASKED ME TO COME AND SEE IF YOU WERE READY TO COME DOWN AND I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING
I AM READY SAID FRODO LETS GO AND LOOK FOR THE REST OF THE PARTY
I CAN TAKE YOU TO THEM SIR SAID SAM ITS A BIG HOUSE THIS AND VERY PECULIAR ALWAYS A BIT MORE TO DISCOVER AND NO KNOWING WHAT YOULL FIND ROUND A CORNER AND ELVES SIR ELVES HERE AND ELVES THERE SOME LIKE KINGS TERRIBLE AND SPLENDID AND SOME AS MERRY AS CHILDREN AND THE MUSIC AND THE SINGING  NOT THAT I HAVE HAD THE TIME OR THE HEART FOR MUCH LISTENING SINCE WE GOT HERE BUT IM GETTING TO KNOW SOME OF THE WAYS OF THE PLACE
I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING SAM SAID FRODO TAKING HIS ARM BUT YOU SHALL BE MERRY TONIGHT AND LISTEN TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT COME ON GUIDE ME ROUND THE CORNERS
SAM LED HIM ALONG SEVERAL PASSAGES AND DOWN MANY STEPS AND OUT INTO A HIGH GARDEN ABOVE THE STEEP BANK OF THE RIVER HE FOUND HIS FRIENDS SITTING IN A PORCH ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE LOOKING EAST SHADOWS HAD FALLEN IN THE VALLEY BELOW BUT THERE WAS STILL A LIGHT ON THE FACES OF THE MOUNTAINS FAR ABOVE THE AIR WAS WARM THE SOUND OF RUNNING AND FALLING WATER WAS LOUD AND THE EVENING WAS FILLED WITH A FAINT SCENT OF TREES AND FLOWERS AS IF SUMMER STILL LINGERED IN ELRONDS GARDENS
HURRAY CRIED PIPPIN SPRINGING UP HERE IS OUR NOBLE COUSIN MAKE WAY FOR FRODO LORD OF THE RING
HUSH SAID GANDALF FROM THE SHADOWS AT THE BACK OF THE PORCH EVIL THINGS DO NOT COME INTO THIS VALLEY BUT ALL THE SAME WE SHOULD NOT NAME THEM THE LORD OF THE RING IS NOT FRODO BUT THE MASTER OF THE DARK TOWER OF MORDOR WHOSE POWER IS AGAIN STRETCHING OUT OVER THE WORLD WE ARE SITTING IN A FORTRESS OUTSIDE IT IS GETTING DARK
GANDALF HAS BEEN SAYING MANY CHEERFUL THINGS LIKE THAT SAID PIPPIN HE THINKS I NEED KEEPING IN ORDER BUT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE SOMEHOW TO FEEL GLOOMY OR DEPRESSED IN THIS PLACE I FEEL I COULD SING IF I KNEW THE RIGHT SONG FOR THE OCCASION
I FEEL LIKE SINGING MYSELF LAUGHED FRODO THOUGH AT THE MOMENT I FEEL MORE LIKE EATING AND DRINKING
THAT WILL SOON BE CURED SAID PIPPIN YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR USUAL CUNNING IN GETTING UP JUST IN TIME FOR A MEAL
MORE THAN MEAL A FEAST SAID MERRY AS SOON AS GANDALF REPORTED THAT YOU WERE RECOVERED THE PREPARATIONS BEGAN HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN THEY WERE SUMMONED TO THE HALL BY THE RINGING OF MANY BELLS
THE HALL OF ELRONDS HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH FOLK ELVES FOR THE MOST PART THOUGH THERE WERE A FEW GUESTS OF OTHER SORTS ELROND AS WAS HIS CUSTOM SAT IN A GREAT CHAIR AT THE END OF THE LONG TABLE UPON THE DAIS AND NEXT TO HIM ON THE ONE SIDE SAT GLORFINDEL ON THE OTHER SIDE SAT GANDALF
FRODO LOOKED AT THEM IN WONDER FOR HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN ELROND OF WHOM SO MANY TALES SPOKE AND AS THEY SAT UPON HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS LEFT GLORFINDEL AND EVEN GANDALF WHOM HE THOUGHT HE KNEW SO WELL WERE REVEALED AS LORDS OF DIGNITY AND POWER GANDALF WAS SHORTER IN STATURE THAN THE OTHER TWO BUT HIS LONG WHITE HAIR HIS SWEEPING SILVER BEARD AND HIS BROAD SHOULDERS MADE HIM LOOK LIKE SOME WISE KING OF ANCIENT LEGEND IN HIS AGED FACE UNDER GREAT SNOWY BROWS HIS DARK EYES WERE SET LIKE COALS THAT COULD LEAP SUDDENLY INTO FIRE
GLORFINDEL WAS TALL AND STRAIGHT HIS HAIR WAS OF SHINING GOLD HIS FACE FAIR AND YOUNG AND FEARLESS AND FULL OF JOY HIS EYES WERE BRIGHT AND KEEN AND HIS VOICE LIKE MUSIC ON HIS BROW SAT WISDOM AND IN HIS HAND WAS STRENGTH
THE FACE OF ELROND WAS AGELESS NEITHER OLD NOR YOUNG THOUGH IN IT WAS WRITTEN THE MEMORY OF MANY THINGS BOTH GLAD AND SORROWFUL HIS HAIR WAS DARK AS THE SHADOWS OF TWILIGHT AND UPON IT WAS SET A CIRCLET OF SILVER HIS EYES WERE GREY AS A CLEAR EVENING AND IN THEM WAS A LIGHT LIKE THE LIGHT OF STARS VENERABLE HE SEEMED AS A KING CROWNED WITH MANY WINTERS AND YET HALE AS A TRIED WARRIOR IN THE FULNESS OF HIS STRENGTH HE WAS THE LORD OF RIVENDELL AND MIGHTY AMONG BOTH ELVES AND MEN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE AGAINST THE WOVEN CLOTHS UPON THE WALL THERE WAS A CHAIR UNDER A CANOPY AND THERE SAT A LADY FAIR TO LOOK UPON AND SO LIKE WAS SHE IN FORM OF WOMANHOOD TO ELROND THAT FRODO GUESSED THAT SHE WAS ONE OF HIS CLOSE KINDRED YOUNG SHE WAS AND YET NOT SO THE BRAIDS OF HER DARK HAIR WERE TOUCHED BY NO FROST HER WHITE ARMS AND CLEAR FACE WERE FLAWLESS AND SMOOTH AND THE LIGHT OF STARS WAS IN HER BRIGHT EYES GREY AS A CLOUDLESS NIGHT YET QUEENLY SHE LOOKED AND THOUGHT AND KNOWLEDGE WERE IN HER GLANCE AS OF ONE WHO HAS KNOWN MANY THINGS THAT THE YEARS BRING ABOVE HER BROW HER HEAD WAS COVERED WITH A CAP OF SILVER LACE NETTED WITH SMALL GEMS GLITTERING WHITE BUT HER SOFT GREY RAIMENT HAD NO ORNAMENT SAVE A GIRDLE OF LEAVES WROUGHT IN SILVER
SO IT WAS THAT FRODO SAW HER WHOM FEW MORTALS HAD YET SEEN ARWEN DAUGHTER OF ELROND IN WHOM IT WAS SAID THAT THE LIKENESS OF LUTHIEN HAD COME ON EARTH AGAIN AND SHE WAS CALLED UNDOMIEL FOR SHE WAS THE EVENSTAR OF HER PEOPLE LONG SHE HAD BEEN IN THE LAND OF HER MOTHERS KIN IN LORIEN BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS AND WAS BUT LATELY RETURNED TO RIVENDELL TO HER FATHERS HOUSE BUT HER BROTHERS ELLADAN AND ELROHIR WERE OUT UPON ERRANTRY FOR THEY RODE OFTEN FAR AFIELD WITH THE RANGERS OF THE NORTH FORGETTING NEVER THEIR MOTHERS TORMENT IN THE DENS OF THE ORCS
SUCH LOVELINESS IN LIVING THING FRODO HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE NOR IMAGINED IN HIS MIND AND HE WAS BOTH SURPRISED AND ABASHED TO FIND THAT HE HAD A SEAT AT ELRONDS TABLE AMONG ALL THESE FOLK SO HIGH AND FAIR THOUGH HE HAD A SUITABLE CHAIR AND WAS RAISED UPON SEVERAL CUSHIONS HE FELT VERY SMALL AND RATHER OUT OF PLACE BUT THAT FEELING QUICKLY PASSED THE FEAST WAS MERRY AND THE FOOD ALL THAT HIS HUNGER COULD DESIRE IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AGAIN OR EVEN TURNED TO HIS NEIGHBOURS
HE LOOKED FIRST FOR HIS FRIENDS SAM HAD BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO WAIT ON HIS MASTER BUT HAD BEEN TOLD THAT FOR THIS TIME HE WAS A GUEST OF HONOUR FRODO COULD SEE HIM NOW SITTING WITH PIPPIN AND MERRY AT THE UPPER END OF ONE OF THE SIDETABLES CLOSE TO THE DAIS HE COULD SEE NO SIGN OF STRIDER
NEXT TO FRODO ON HIS RIGHT SAT A DWARF OF IMPORTANT APPEARANCE RICHLY DRESSED HIS BEARD VERY LONG AND FORKED WAS WHITE NEARLY AS WHITE AS THE SNOWWHITE CLOTH OF HIS GARMENTS HE WORE A SILVER BELT AND ROUND HIS NECK HUNG A CHAIN OF SILVER AND DIAMONDS FRODO STOPPED EATING TO LOOK AT HIM
WELCOME AND WELL MET SAID THE DWARF TURNING TOWARDS HIM THEN HE ACTUALLY ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND BOWED GLOIN AT YOUR SERVICE HE SAID AND BOWED STILL LOWER
FRODO BAGGINS AT YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR FAMILYS SAID FRODO CORRECTLY RISING IN SURPRISE AND SCATTERING HIS CUSHIONS AM I RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT YOU ARE THE GLOIN ONE OF THE TWELVE COMPANIONS OF THE GREAT THORIN OAKENSHIELD
QUITE RIGHT ANSWERED THE DWARF GATHERING UP THE CUSHIONS AND COURTEOUSLY ASSISTING FRODO BACK INTO HIS SEAT AND I DO NOT ASK FOR I HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOLD THAT YOU ARE THE KINSMAN AND ADOPTED HEIR OF OUR FRIEND BILBO THE RENOWNED ALLOW ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR RECOVERY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID FRODO
YOU HAVE HAD SOME VERY STRANGE ADVENTURES I HEAR SAID GLOIN I WONDER GREATLY WHAT BRINGS FOUR HOBBITS ON SO LONG A JOURNEY NOTHING LIKE IT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BILBO CAME WITH US BUT PERHAPS I SHOULD NOT INQUIRE TOO CLOSELY SINCE ELROND AND GANDALF DO NOT SEEM DISPOSED TO TALK OF THIS
I THINK WE WILL NOT SPEAK OF IT AT LEAST NOT YET SAID FRODO POLITELY
HE GUESSED THAT EVEN IN ELRONDS HOUSE THE MATTER OF THE RING WAS NOT ONE FOR CASUAL TALK AND IN ANY CASE HE WISHED TO FORGET HIS TROUBLES FOR A TIME BUT I AM EQUALLY CURIOUS HE ADDED TO LEARN WHAT BRINGS SO IMPORTANT A DWARF SO FAR FROM THE LONELY MOUNTAIN
GLOIN LOOKED AT HIM IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD I THINK WE WILL NOT SPEAK YET OF THAT EITHER MASTER ELROND WILL SUMMON US ALL ERE LONG I BELIEVE AND THEN WE SHALL ALL HEAR MANY THINGS BUT THERE IS MUCH ELSE THAT MAY BE TOLD
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE MEAL THEY TALKED TOGETHER BUT FRODO LISTENED MORE THAN HE SPOKE FOR THE NEWS OF THE SHIRE APART FROM THE RING SEEMED SMALL AND FARAWAY AND UNIMPORTANT WHILE GLOIN HAD MUCH TO TELL OF EVENTS IN THE NORTHERN REGIONS OF WILDERLAND FRODO LEARNED THAT GRIMBEORN THE OLD SON OF BEORN WAS NOW THE LORD OF MANY STURDY MEN AND TO THEIR LAND BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND MIRKWOOD NEITHER ORC NOR WOLF DARED TO GO
INDEED SAID GLOIN IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE BEORNINGS THE PASSAGE FROM DALE TO RIVENDELL WOULD LONG AGO HAVE BECOME IMPOSSIBLE THEY ARE VALIANT MEN AND KEEP OPEN THE HIGH PASS AND THE FORD OF CARROCK BUT THEIR TOLLS ARE HIGH HE ADDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD AND LIKE BEORN OF OLD THEY ARE NOT OVER FOND OF DWARVES STILL THEY ARE TRUSTY AND THAT IS MUCH IN THESE DAYS NOWHERE ARE THERE ANY MEN SO FRIENDLY TO US AS THE MEN OF DALE THEY ARE GOOD FOLK THE BARDINGS THE GRANDSON OF BARD THE BOWMAN RULES THEM BRAND SON OF BAIN SON OF BARD HE IS A STRONG KING AND HIS REALM NOW REACHES FAR SOUTH AND EAST OF ESGAROTH
AND WHAT OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE ASKED FRODO
THERE IS MUCH TO TELL GOOD AND BAD SAID GLOIN YET IT IS MOSTLY GOOD WE HAVE SO FAR BEEN FORTUNATE THOUGH WE DO NOT ESCAPE THE SHADOW OF THESE TIMES IF YOU REALLY WISH TO HEAR OF US I WILL TELL YOU TIDINGS GLADLY BUT STOP ME WHEN YOU ARE WEARY DWARVES TONGUES RUN ON WHEN SPEAKING OF THEIR HANDIWORK THEY SAY
AND WITH THAT GLOIN EMBARKED ON A LONG ACCOUNT OF THE DOINGS OF THE DWARFKINGDOM HE WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE FOUND SO POLITE A LISTENER FOR FRODO SHOWED NO SIGN OF WEARINESS AND MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT THOUGH ACTUALLY HE SOON GOT RATHER LOST AMONG THE STRANGE NAMES OF PEOPLE AND PLACES THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE HE WAS INTERESTED HOWEVER TO HEAR THAT DAIN WAS STILL KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN AND WAS NOW OLD HAVING PASSED HIS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH YEAR VENERABLE AND FABULOUSLY RICH OF THE TEN COMPANIONS WHO HAD SURVIVED THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES SEVEN WERE STILL WITH HIM DWALIN GLOIN DORI NORI BIFUR BOFUR AND BOMBUR BOMBUR WAS NOW SO FAT THAT HE COULD NOT MOVE HIMSELF FROM HIS COUCH TO HIS CHAIR AT TABLE AND IT TOOK SIX YOUNG DWARVES TO LIFT HIM
AND WHAT HAS BECOME OF BALIN AND ORI AND OIN ASKED FRODO
A SHADOW PASSED OVER GLOINS FACE WE DO NOT KNOW HE ANSWERED IT IS LARGELY ON ACCOUNT OF BALIN THAT I HAVE COME TO ASK THE ADVICE OF THOSE THAT DWELL IN RIVENDELL BUT TONIGHT LET US SPEAK OF MERRIER THINGS
GLOIN BEGAN THEN TO TALK OF THE WORKS OF HIS PEOPLE TELLING FRODO ABOUT THEIR GREAT LABOURS IN DALE AND UNDER THE MOUNTAIN WE HAVE DONE WELL HE SAID BUT IN METALWORK WE CANNOT RIVAL OUR FATHERS MANY OF WHOSE SECRETS ARE LOST WE MAKE GOOD ARMOUR AND KEEN SWORDS BUT WE CANNOT AGAIN MAKE MAIL OR BLADE TO MATCH THOSE THAT WERE MADE BEFORE THE DRAGON CAME ONLY IN MINING AND BUILDING HAVE WE SURPASSED THE OLD DAYS YOU SHOULD SEE THE WATERWAYS OF DALE FRODO AND THE FOUNTAINS AND THE POOLS YOU SHOULD SEE THE STONEPAVED ROADS OF MANY COLOURS AND THE HALLS AND CAVERNOUS STREETS UNDER THE EARTH WITH ARCHES CARVED LIKE TREES AND THE TERRACES AND TOWERS UPON THE MOUNTAINS SIDES THEN YOU WOULD SEE THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN IDLE
I WILL COME AND SEE THEM IF EVER I CAN SAID FRODO HOW SURPRISED BILBO WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SEE ALL THE CHANGES IN THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG
GLOIN LOOKED AT FRODO AND SMILED YOU WERE VERY FOND OF BILBO WERE YOU NOT HE ASKED
YES ANSWERED FRODO I WOULD RATHER SEE HIM THAN ALL THE TOWERS AND PALACES IN THE WORLD
AT LENGTH THE FEAST CAME TO AN END ELROND AND ARWEN ROSE AND WENT DOWN THE HALL AND THE COMPANY FOLLOWED THEM IN DUE ORDER THE DOORS WERE THROWN OPEN AND THEY WENT ACROSS A WIDE PASSAGE AND THROUGH OTHER DOORS AND CAME INTO A FURTHER HALL IN IT WERE NO TABLES BUT A BRIGHT FIRE WAS BURNING IN A GREAT HEARTH BETWEEN THE CARVEN PILLARS UPON EITHER SIDE
FRODO FOUND HIMSELF WALKING WITH GANDALF THIS IS THE HALL OF FIRE SAID THE WIZARD HERE YOU WILL HEAR MANY SONGS AND TALESIF YOU CAN KEEP AWAKE BUT EXCEPT ON HIGH DAYS IT USUALLY STANDS EMPTY AND QUIET AND PEOPLE COME HERE WHO WISH FOR PEACE AND THOUGHT THERE IS ALWAYS A FIRE HERE ALL THE YEAR ROUND BUT THERE IS LITTLE OTHER LIGHT
AS ELROND ENTERED AND WENT TOWARDS THE SEAT PREPARED FOR HIM ELVISH MINSTRELS BEGAN TO MAKE SWEET MUSIC SLOWLY THE HALL FILLED AND FRODO LOOKED WITH DELIGHT UPON THE MANY FAIR FACES THAT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THE GOLDEN FIRELIGHT PLAYED UPON THEM AND SHIMMERED IN THEIR HAIR SUDDENLY HE NOTICED NOT FAR FROM THE FURTHER END OF THE FIRE A SMALL DARK FIGURE SEATED ON A STOOL WITH HIS BACK PROPPED AGAINST A PILLAR BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND WAS A DRINKINGCUP AND SOME BREAD FRODO WONDERED WHETHER HE WAS ILL IF PEOPLE WERE EVER ILL IN RIVENDELL AND HAD BEEN UNABLE TO COME TO THE FEAST HIS HEAD SEEMED SUNK IN SLEEP ON HIS BREAST AND A FOLD OF HIS DARK CLOAK WAS DRAWN OVER HIS FACE
ELROND WENT FORWARD AND STOOD BESIDE THE SILENT FIGURE AWAKE LITTLE MASTER HE SAID WITH A SMILE THEN TURNING TO FRODO HE BECKONED TO HIM NOW AT LAST THE HOUR HAS COME THAT YOU HAVE WISHED FOR FRODO HE SAID HERE IS A FRIEND THAT YOU HAVE LONG MISSED
THE DARK FIGURE RAISED ITS HEAD AND UNCOVERED ITS FACE

IN THE MEANWHILE FRODO AND BILBO SAT SIDE BY SIDE AND SAM CAME QUICKLY AND PLACED HIMSELF NEAR THEM THEY TALKED TOGETHER IN SOFT VOICES OBLIVIOUS OF THE MIRTH AND MUSIC IN THE HALL ABOUT THEM BILBO HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY OF HIMSELF WHEN HE HAD LEFT HOBBITON HE HAD WANDERED OFF AIMLESSLY ALONG THE ROAD OR IN THE COUNTRY ON EITHER SIDE BUT SOMEHOW HE HAD STEERED ALL THE TIME TOWARDS RIVENDELL I GOT HERE WITHOUT MUCH ADVENTURE HE SAID AND AFTER A REST I WENT ON WITH THE DWARVES TO DALE MY LAST JOURNEY I SHANT TRAVEL AGAIN OLD BALIN HAD GONE AWAY THEN I CAME BACK HERE AND HERE I HAVE BEEN I HAVE DONE THIS AND THAT I HAVE WRITTEN SOME MORE OF MY BOOK AND OF COURSE I MAKE UP A FEW SONGS THEY SING THEM OCCASIONALLY JUST TO PLEASE ME I THINK FOR OF COURSE THEY ARENT REALLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR RIVENDELL AND I LISTEN AND I THINK TIME DOESNT SEEM TO PASS HERE IT JUST IS A REMARKABLE PLACE ALTOGETHER

WHEN HE HAD DRESSED FRODO FOUND THAT WHILE HE SLEPT THE RING HAD BEEN HUNG ABOUT HIS NECK ON A NEW CHAIN LIGHT BUT STRONG SLOWLY HE DREW IT OUT BILBO PUT OUT HIS HAND BUT FRODO QUICKLY DREW BACK THE RING TO HIS DISTRESS AND AMAZEMENT HE FOUND THAT HE WAS NO LONGER LOOKING AT BILBO A SHADOW SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN BETWEEN THEM AND THROUGH IT HE FOUND HIMSELF EYEING A LITTLE WRINKLED CREATURE WITH A HUNGRY FACE AND BONY GROPING HANDS HE FELT A DESIRE TO STRIKE HIM
THE MUSIC AND SINGING ROUND THEM SEEMED TO FALTER AND A SILENCE FELL BILBO LOOKED QUICKLY AT FRODOS FACE AND PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES I UNDERSTAND NOW HE SAID PUT IT AWAY I AM SORRY SORRY YOU HAVE COME IN FOR THIS BURDEN SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING DONT ADVENTURES EVER HAVE AN END I SUPPOSE NOT SOMEONE ELSE ALWAYS HAS TO CARRY ON THE STORY WELL IT CANT BE HELPED I WONDER IF ITS ANY GOOD TRYING TO FINISH MY BOOK BUT DONT LETS WORRY ABOUT IT NOW  LETS HAVE SOME REAL NEWS TELL ME ALL ABOUT THE SHIRE

SUDDENLY BILBO LOOKED UP AH THERE YOU ARE AT LAST DUNADAN HE CRIED
STRIDER SAID FRODO YOU SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF NAMES
WELL STRIDER IS ONE THAT I HAVENT HEARD BEFORE ANYWAY SAID BILBO WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM THAT FOR
THEY CALL ME THAT IN BREE SAID STRIDER LAUGHING AND THAT IS HOW I WAS INTRODUCED TO HIM
AND WHY DO YOU CALL HIM DUNADAN ASKED FRODO
THE DUNADAN SAID BILBO HE IS OFTEN CALLED THAT HERE BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNEW ENOUGH ELVISH AT LEAST TO KNOW DUNUDAN MAN OF THE WEST NUMENOREAN BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR LESSONS HE TURNED TO STRIDER
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MY FRIEND WHY WERENT YOU AT THE FEAST THE LADY ARWEN WAS THERE
STRIDER LOOKED DOWN AT BILBO GRAVELY I KNOW HE SAID BUT OFTEN I MUST PUT MIRTH ASIDE ELLADAN AND ELROHIR HAVE RETURNED OUT OF THE WILD UNLOOKEDFOR AND THEY HAD TIDINGS THAT I WISHED TO HEAR AT ONCE
WELL MY DEAR FELLOW SAID BILBO NOW YOUVE HEARD THE NEWS CANT YOU SPARE ME A MOMENT I WANT YOUR HELP IN SOMETHING URGENT ELROND SAYS THIS SONG OF MINE IS TO BE FINISHED BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING AND I AM STUCK LETS GO OFF INTO A CORNER AND POLISH IT UP
STRIDER SMILED COME THEN HE SAID LET ME HEAR IT
FRODO WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF FOR A WHILE FOR SAM HAD FALLEN ASLEEP HE WAS ALONE AND FELT RATHER FORLORN ALTHOUGH ALL ABOUT HIM THE FOLK OF RIVENDELL WERE GATHERED BUT THOSE NEAR HIM WERE SILENT INTENT UPON THE MUSIC OF THE VOICES AND THE INSTRUMENTS AND THEY GAVE NO HEED TO ANYTHING ELSE FRODO BEGAN TO LISTEN
AT FIRST THE BEAUTY OF THE MELODIES AND OF THE INTERWOVEN WORDS IN ELVENTONGUES EVEN THOUGH HE UNDERSTOOD THEM LITTLE HELD HIM IN A SPELL AS SOON AS HE BEGAN TO ATTEND TO THEM ALMOST IT SEEMED THAT THE WORDS TOOK SHAPE AND VISIONS OF FAR LANDS AND BRIGHT THINGS THAT HE HAD NEVER YET IMAGINED OPENED OUT BEFORE HIM AND THE FIRELIT HALL BECAME LIKE A GOLDEN MIST ABOVE SEAS OF FOAM THAT SIGHED UPON THE MARGINS OF THE WORLD THEN THE ENCHANTMENT BECAME MORE AND MORE DREAMLIKE UNTIL HE FELT THAT AN ENDLESS RIVER OF SWELLING GOLD AND SILVER WAS FLOWING OVER HIM TOO MULTITUDINOUS FOR ITS PATTERN TO BE COMPREHENDED IT BECAME PART OF THE THROBBING AIR ABOUT HIM AND IT DRENCHED AND DROWNED HIM SWIFTLY HE SANK UNDER ITS SHINING WEIGHT INTO A DEEP REALM OF SLEEP
THERE HE WANDERED LONG IN A DREAM OF MUSIC THAT TURNED INTO RUNNING WATER AND THEN SUDDENLY INTO A VOICE IT SEEMED TO BE THE VOICE OF BILBO CHANTING VERSES FAINT AT FIRST AND THEN CLEARER RAN THE WORDS
EARENDIL WAS A MARINER
THAT TARRIED IN ARVERNIEN
HE BUILT A BOAT OF TIMBER FELLED
IN NIMBRETHIL TO JOURNEY IN
HER SAILS HE WOVE OF SILVER FAIR
OF SILVER WERE HER LANTERNS MADE
HER PROW WAS FASHIONED LIKE A SWAN
AND LIGHT UPON HER BANNERS LAID

IN PANOPLY OF ANCIENT KINGS
IN CHAINED RINGS HE ARMOURED HIM
HIS SHINING SHIELD WAS SCORED WITH RUNES
TO WARD ALL WOUNDS AND HARM FROM HIM
HIS BOW WAS MADE OF DRAGONHORN
HIS ARROWS SHORN OF EBONY
OF SILVER WAS HIS HABERGEON
HIS SCABBARD OF CHALCEDONY
HIS SWORD OF STEEL WAS VALIANT
OF ADAMANT HIS HELMET TALL
AN EAGLEPLUME UPON HIS CREST
UPON HIS BREAST AN EMERALD

BENEATH THE MOON AND UNDER STAR
HE WANDERED FAR FROM NORTHERN STRANDS
BEWILDERED ON ENCHANTED WAYS
BEYOND THE DAYS OF MORTAL LANDS
FROM GNASHING OF THE NARROW ICE
WHERE SHADOW LIES ON FROZEN HILLS
FROM NETHER HEATS AND BURNING WASTE
HE TURNED IN HASTE AND ROVING STILL
ON STARLESS WATERS FAR ASTRAY
AT LAST HE CAME TO NIGHT OF NAUGHT
AND PASSED AND NEVER SIGHT HE SAW
OF SHINING SHORE NOR LIGHT HE SOUGHT

THE WINDS OF WRATH CAME DRIVING HIM
AND BLINDLY IN THE FOAM HE FLED
FROM WEST TO EAST AND ERRANDLESS
UNHERALDED HE HOMEWARD SPED

THERE FLYING ELWING CAME TO HIM
AND FLAME WAS IN THE DARKNESS LIT
MORE BRIGHT THAN LIGHT OF DIAMOND
THE FIRE UPON HER CARCANET
THE SILMARIL SHE BOUND ON HIM
AND CROWNED HIM WITH THE LIVING LIGHT
AND DAUNTLESS THEN WITH BURNING BROW
HE TURNED HIS PROW AND IN THE NIGHT
FROM OTHERWORLD BEYOND THE SEA
THERE STRONG AND FREE A STORM AROSE
A WIND OF POWER IN TARMENEL
BY PATHS THAT SELDOM MORTAL GOES
HIS BOAT IT BORE WITH BITING BREATH
AS MIGHT OF DEATH ACROSS THE GREY
AND LONGFORSAKEN SEAS DISTRESSED
FROM EAST TO WEST HE PASSED AWAY

THROUGH EVERNIGHT HE BACK WAS BORNE
ON BLACK AND ROARING WAVES THAT RAN
OER LEAGUES UNLIT AND FOUNDERED SHORES
THAT DROWNED BEFORE THE DAYS BEGAN
UNTIL HE HEARD ON STRANDS OF PEARL
WHEN ENDS THE WORLD THE MUSIC LONG
WHERE EVER FOAMING BILLOWS ROLL
THE YELLOW GOLD AND JEWELS WAN
HE SAW THE MOUNTAIN SILENT RISE
WHERE TWILIGHT LIES UPON THE KNEES
OF VALINOR AND ELDAMAR
BEHELD AFAR BEYOND THE SEAS
A WANDERER ESCAPED FROM NIGHT
TO HAVEN WHITE HE CAME AT LAST
TO ELVENHOME THE GREEN AND FAIR
WHERE KEEN THE AIR WHERE PALE AS GLASS
BENEATH THE HILL OF ILMARIN
AGLIMMER IN A VALLEY SHEER
THE LAMPLIT TOWERS OF TIRION
ARE MIRRORED ON THE SHADOWMERE

HE TARRIED THERE FROM ERRANTRY
AND MELODIES THEY TAUGHT TO HIM
AND SAGES OLD HIM MARVELS TOLD
AND HARPS OF GOLD THEY BROUGHT TO HIM
THEY CLOTHED HIM THEN IN ELVENWHITE
AND SEVEN LIGHTS BEFORE HIM SENT
AS THROUGH THE CALACIRIAN
TO HIDDEN LAND FORLORN HE WENT
HE CAME UNTO THE TIMELESS HALLS
WHERE SHINING FALL THE COUNTLESS YEARS
AND ENDLESS REIGNS THE ELDER KING
IN ILMARIN ON MOUNTAIN SHEER
AND WORDS UNHEARD WERE SPOKEN THEN
OF FOLK OF MEN AND ELVENKIN
BEYOND THE WORLD WERE VISIONS SHOWED
FORBID TO THOSE THAT DWELL THEREIN

A SHIP THEN NEW THEY BUILT FOR HIM
OF MITHRIL AND OF ELVENGLASS
WITH SHINING PROW NO SHAVEN OAR
NOR SAIL SHE BORE ON SILVER MAST
THE SILMARIL AS LANTERN LIGHT
AND BANNER BRIGHT WITH LIVING FLAME
TO GLEAM THEREON BY ELBERETH
HERSELF WAS SET WHO THITHER CAME
AND WINGS IMMORTAL MADE FOR HIM
AND LAID ON HIM UNDYING DOOM
TO SAIL THE SHORELESS SKIES AND COME
BEHIND THE SUN AND LIGHT OF MOON

FROM EVEREVENS LOFTY HILLS
WHERE SOFTLY SILVER FOUNTAINS FALL
HIS WINGS HIM BORE A WANDERING LIGHT
BEYOND THE MIGHTY MOUNTAIN WALL
FROM WORLDS END THEN HE TURNED AWAY
AND YEARNED AGAIN TO FIND AFAR
HIS HOME THROUGH SHADOWS JOURNEYING
AND BURNING AS AN ISLAND STAR
ON HIGH ABOVE THE MISTS HE CAME
A DISTANT FLAME BEFORE THE SUN
A WONDER ERE THE WAKING DAWN
WHERE GREY THE NORLAND WATERS RUN

AND OVER MIDDLEEARTH HE PASSED
AND HEARD AT LAST THE WEEPING SORE
OF WOMEN AND OF ELVENMAIDS
IN ELDER DAYS IN YEARS OF YORE
BUT ON HIM MIGHTY DOOM WAS LAID
TILL MOON SHOULD FADE AN ORBED STAR
TO PASS AND TARRY NEVER MORE
ON HITHER SHORES WHERE MORTALS ARE
FOR EVER STILL A HERALD ON
AN ERRAND THAT SHOULD NEVER REST
TO BEAR HIS SHINING LAMP AFAR
THE FLAMMIFER OF WESTERNESSE

THE CHANTING CEASED FRODO OPENED HIS EYES AND SAW THAT BILBO WAS SEATED ON HIS STOOL IN A CIRCLE OF LISTENERS WHO WERE SMILING AND APPLAUDING
NOW WE HAD BETTER HAVE IT AGAIN SAID AN ELF
BILBO GOT UP AND BOWED I AM FLATTERED LINDIR HE SAID BUT IT WOULD BE TOO TIRING TO REPEAT IT ALL
NOT TOO TIRING FOR YOU THE ELVES ANSWERED LAUGHING YOU KNOW YOU ARE NEVER TIRED OF RECITING YOUR OWN VERSES BUT REALLY WE CANNOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AT ONE HEARING
WHAT CRIED BILBO YOU CANT TELL WHICH PARTS WERE MINE AND WHICH WERE THE DUNADANS
IT IS NOT EASY FOR US TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO MORTALS SAID THE ELF
NONSENSE LINDIR SNORTED BILBO IF YOU CANT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A MAN AND A HOBBIT YOUR JUDGEMENT IS POORER THAN I IMAGINED THEYRE AS DIFFERENT AS PEAS AND APPLES
MAYBE TO SHEEP OTHER SHEEP NO DOUBT APPEAR DIFFERENT LAUGHED LINDIR OR TO SHEPHERDS BUT MORTALS HAVE NOT BEEN OUR STUDY WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS
I WONT ARGUE WITH YOU SAID BILBO I AM SLEEPY AFTER SO MUCH MUSIC AND SINGING ILL LEAVE YOU TO GUESS IF YOU WANT TO
HE GOT UP AND CAME TOWARDS FRODO WELL THATS OVER HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE IT WENT OFF BETTER THAN I EXPECTED I DONT OFTEN GET ASKED FOR A SECOND HEARING WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT
I AM NOT GOING TO TRY AND GUESS SAID FRODO SMILING
YOU NEEDNT SAID BILBO AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS ALL MINE EXCEPT THAT ARAGORN INSISTED ON MY PUTTING IN A GREEN STONE HE SEEMED TO THINK IT IMPORTANT I DONT KNOW WHY OTHERWISE HE OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING RATHER ABOVE MY HEAD AND HE SAID THAT IF I HAD THE CHEEK TO MAKE VERSES ABOUT EARENDIL IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND IT WAS MY AFFAIR I SUPPOSE HE WAS RIGHT
I DONT KNOW SAID FRODO IT SEEMED TO ME TO FIT SOMEHOW THOUGH I CANT EXPLAIN I WAS HALF ASLEEP WHEN YOU BEGAN AND IT SEEMED TO FOLLOW ON FROM SOMETHING THAT I WAS DREAMING ABOUT I DIDNT UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS REALLY YOU SPEAKING UNTIL NEAR THE END
IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP AWAKE HERE UNTIL YOU GET USED TO IT SAID BILBO NOT THAT HOBBITS WOULD EVER ACQUIRE QUITE THE ELVISH APPETITE FOR MUSIC AND POETRY AND TALES THEY SEEM TO LIKE THEM AS MUCH AS FOOD OR MORE THEY WILL BE GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME YET WHAT DO YOU SAY TO SLIPPING OFF FOR SOME MORE QUIET TALK
CAN WE SAID FRODO
OF COURSE THIS IS MERRYMAKING NOT BUSINESS COME AND GO AS YOU LIKE AS LONG AS YOU DONT MAKE A NOISE
THEY GOT UP AND WITHDREW QUIETLY INTO THE SHADOWS AND MADE FOR THE DOORS SAM THEY LEFT BEHIND FAST ASLEEP STILL WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE IN SPITE OF HIS DELIGHT IN BILBOS COMPANY FRODO FELT A TUG OF REGRET AS THEY PASSED OUT OF THE HALL OF FIRE EVEN AS THEY STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD A SINGLE CLEAR VOICE ROSE IN SONG
A ELBERETH GILTHONIEL
SILIVREN PENNA MIRIEL
O MENEL AGLAR ELENATH
NACHAERED PALANDIRIEL
O GALADHREMMIN ENNORATH
FANUILOS LE LINNATHON
NEF AEAR SI NEF AEARON

FRODO HALTED FOR A MOMENT LOOKING BACK ELROND WAS IN HIS CHAIR AND THE FIRE WAS ON HIS FACE LIKE SUMMERLIGHT UPON THE TREES NEAR HIM SAT THE LADY ARWEN TO HIS SURPRISE FRODO SAW THAT ARAGORN STOOD BESIDE HER HIS DARK CLOAK WAS THROWN BACK AND HE SEEMED TO BE CLAD IN ELVENMAIL AND A STAR SHONE ON HIS BREAST THEY SPOKE TOGETHER AND THEN SUDDENLY IT SEEMED TO FRODO THAT ARWEN TURNED TOWARDS HIM AND THE LIGHT OF HER EYES FELL ON HIM FROM AFAR AND PIERCED HIS HEART
HE STOOD STILL ENCHANTED WHILE THE SWEET SYLLABLES OF THE ELVISH SONG FELL LIKE CLEAR JEWELS OF BLENDED WORD AND MELODY IT IS A SONG TO ELBERETH SAID BILBO THEY WILL SING THAT AND OTHER SONGS OF THE BLESSED REALM MANY TIMES TONIGHT COME ON
HE LED FRODO BACK TO HIS OWN LITTLE ROOM IT OPENED ON TO THE GARDENS AND LOOKED SOUTH ACROSS THE RAVINE OF THE BRUINEN THERE THEY SAT FOR SOME WHILE LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE BRIGHT STARS ABOVE THE STEEPCLIMBING WOODS AND TALKING SOFTLY THEY SPOKE NO MORE OF THE SMALL NEWS OF THE SHIRE FAR AWAY NOR OF THE DARK SHADOWS AND PERILS THAT ENCOMPASSED THEM BUT OF THE FAIR THINGS THEY HAD SEEN IN THE WORLD TOGETHER OF THE ELVES OF THE STARS OF TREES AND THE GENTLE FALL OF THE BRIGHT YEAR IN THE WOODS
AT LAST THERE CAME A KNOCK ON THE DOOR BEGGING YOUR PARDON SAID SAM PUTTING IN HIS HEAD BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU WOULD BE WANTING ANYTHING
AND BEGGING YOURS SAM GAMGEE REPLIED BILBO I GUESS YOU MEAN THAT IT IS TIME YOUR MASTER WENT TO BED
WELL SIR THERE IS A COUNCIL EARLY TOMORROW I HEAR AND HE ONLY GOT UP TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME

CHAPTER 2
THE COUNCIL OF ELROND

NEXT DAY FRODO WOKE EARLY FEELING REFRESHED AND WELL HE WALKED ALONG THE TERRACES ABOVE THE LOUDFLOWING BRUINEN AND WATCHED THE PALE COOL SUN RISE ABOVE THE FAR MOUNTAINS AND SHINE DOWN SLANTING THROUGH THE THIN SILVER MIST THE DEW UPON THE YELLOW LEAVES WAS GLIMMERING AND THE WOVEN NETS OF GOSSAMER TWINKLED ON EVERY BUSH SAM WALKED BESIDE HIM SAYING NOTHING BUT SNIFFING THE AIR AND LOOKING EVERY NOW AND AGAIN WITH WONDER IN HIS EYES AT THE GREAT HEIGHTS IN THE EAST THE SNOW WAS WHITE UPON THEIR PEAKS

ON A SEAT CUT IN THE STONE BESIDE A TURN IN THE PATH THEY CAME UPON GANDALF AND BILBO DEEP IN TALK HULLO GOOD MORNING SAID BILBO FEEL READY FOR THE GREAT COUNCIL
I FEEL READY FOR ANYTHING ANSWERED FRODO BUT MOST OF ALL I SHOULD LIKE TO GO WALKING TODAY AND EXPLORE THE VALLEY I SHOULD LIKE TO GET INTO THOSE PINEWOODS UP THERE HE POINTED AWAY FAR UP THE SIDE OF RIVENDELL TO THE NORTH
YOU MAY HAVE A CHANCE LATER SAID GANDALF BUT WE CANNOT MAKE ANY PLANS YET THERE IS MUCH TO HEAR AND DECIDE TODAY
SUDDENLY AS THEY WERE TALKING A SINGLE CLEAR BELL RANG OUT THAT IS THE WARNING BELL FOR THE COUNCIL OF ELROND CRIED GANDALF COME ALONG NOW BOTH YOU AND BILBO ARE WANTED
FRODO AND BILBO FOLLOWED THE WIZARD QUICKLY ALONG THE WINDING PATH BACK TO THE HOUSE BEHIND THEM UNINVITED AND FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN TROTTED SAM
GANDALF LED THEM TO THE PORCH WHERE FRODO HAD FOUND HIS FRIENDS THE EVENING BEFORE THE LIGHT OF THE CLEAR AUTUMN MORNING WAS NOW GLOWING IN THE VALLEY THE NOISE OF BUBBLING WATERS CAME UP FROM THE FOAMING RIVERBED BIRDS WERE SINGING AND A WHOLESOME PEACE LAY ON THE LAND TO FRODO HIS DANGEROUS FLIGHT AND THE RUMOURS OF THE DARKNESS GROWING IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE ALREADY SEEMED ONLY THE MEMORIES OF A TROUBLED DREAM BUT THE FACES THAT WERE TURNED TO MEET THEM AS THEY ENTERED WERE GRAVE
ELROND WAS THERE AND SEVERAL OTHERS WERE SEATED IN SILENCE ABOUT HIM FRODO SAW GLORFINDEL AND GLOIN AND IN A CORNER ALONE STRIDER WAS SITTING CLAD IN HIS OLD TRAVELWORN CLOTHES AGAIN ELROND DREW FRODO TO A SEAT BY HIS SIDE AND PRESENTED HIM TO THE COMPANY SAYING
HERE MY FRIENDS IS THE HOBBIT FRODO SON OF DROGO FEW HAVE EVER COME HITHER THROUGH GREATER PERIL OR ON AN ERRAND MORE URGENT
HE THEN POINTED OUT AND NAMED THOSE WHOM FRODO HAD NOT MET BEFORE THERE WAS A YOUNGER DWARF AT GLOINS SIDE HIS SON GIMLI BESIDE GLORFINDEL THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER COUNSELLORS OF ELRONDS HOUSEHOLD OF WHOM ERESTOR WAS THE CHIEF AND WITH HIM WAS GALDOR AN ELF FROM THE GREY HAVENS WHO HAD COME ON AN ERRAND FROM CIRDAN THE SHIPWRIGHT THERE WAS ALSO A STRANGE ELF CLAD IN GREEN AND BROWN LEGOLAS A MESSENGER FROM HIS FATHER THRANDUIL THE KING OF THE ELVES OF NORTHERN MIRKWOOD AND SEATED A LITTLE APART WAS A TALL MAN WITH A FAIR AND NOBLE FACE DARKHAIRED AND GREYEYED PROUD AND STERN OF GLANCE
HE WAS CLOAKED AND BOOTED AS IF FOR A JOURNEY ON HORSEBACK AND INDEED THOUGH HIS GARMENTS WERE RICH AND HIS CLOAK WAS LINED WITH FUR THEY WERE STAINED WITH LONG TRAVEL HE HAD A COLLAR OF SILVER IN WHICH A SINGLE WHITE STONE WAS SET HIS LOCKS WERE SHORN ABOUT HIS SHOULDERS ON A BALDRIC HE WORE A GREAT HORN TIPPED WITH SILVER THAT NOW WAS LAID UPON HIS KNEES HE GAZED AT FRODO AND BILBO WITH SUDDEN WONDER
HERE SAID ELROND TURNING TO GANDALF IS BOROMIR A MAN FROM THE SOUTH HE ARRIVED IN THE GREY MORNING AND SEEKS FOR COUNSEL I HAVE BIDDEN HIM TO BE PRESENT FOR HERE HIS QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED
NOT ALL THAT WAS SPOKEN AND DEBATED IN THE COUNCIL NEED NOW BE TOLD MUCH WAS SAID OF EVENTS IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH AND IN THE WIDE LANDS EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THESE THINGS FRODO HAD ALREADY HEARD MANY RUMOURS BUT THE TALE OF GLOIN WAS NEW TO HIM AND WHEN THE DWARF SPOKE HE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY IT APPEARED THAT AMID THE SPLENDOUR OF THEIR WORKS OF HAND THE HEARTS OF THE DWARVES OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN WERE TROUBLED
IT IS NOW MANY YEARS AGO SAID GLOIN THAT A SHADOW OF DISQUIET FELL UPON OUR PEOPLE WHENCE IT CAME WE DID NOT AT FIRST PERCEIVE WORDS BEGAN TO BE WHISPERED IN SECRET IT WAS SAID THAT WE WERE HEMMED IN A NARROW PLACE AND THAT GREATER WEALTH AND SPLENDOUR WOULD BE FOUND IN A WIDER WORLD SOME SPOKE OF MORIA THE MIGHTY WORKS OF OUR FATHERS THAT ARE CALLED IN OUR OWN TONGUE KHAZADDUM AND THEY DECLARED THAT NOW AT LAST WE HAD THE POWER AND NUMBERS TO RETURN
GLOIN SIGHED MORIA MORIA WONDER OF THE NORTHERN WORLD TOO DEEP WE DELVED THERE AND WOKE THE NAMELESS FEAR LONG HAVE ITS VAST MANSIONS LAIN EMPTY SINCE THE CHILDREN OF DURIN FLED BUT NOW WE SPOKE OF IT AGAIN WITH LONGING AND YET WITH DREAD FOR NO DWARF HAS DARED TO PASS THE DOORS OF KHAZADDUM FOR MANY LIVES OF KINGS SAVE THROR ONLY AND HE PERISHED AT LAST HOWEVER BALIN LISTENED TO THE WHISPERS AND RESOLVED TO GO AND THOUGH DAIN DID NOT GIVE LEAVE WILLINGLY HE TOOK WITH HIM ORI AND OIN AND MANY OF OUR FOLK AND THEY WENT AWAY SOUTH
THAT WAS NIGH ON THIRTY YEARS AGO FOR A WHILE WE HAD NEWS AND IT SEEMED GOOD MESSAGES REPORTED THAT MORIA HAD BEEN ENTERED AND A GREAT WORK BEGUN THERE THEN THERE WAS SILENCE AND NO WORD HAS EVER COME FROM MORIA SINCE
THEN ABOUT A YEAR AGO A MESSENGER CAME TO DAIN BUT NOT FROM MORIA  FROM MORDOR A HORSEMAN IN THE NIGHT WHO CALLED DAIN TO HIS GATE THE LORD SAURON THE GREAT SO HE SAID WISHED FOR OUR FRIENDSHIP RINGS HE WOULD GIVE FOR IT SUCH AS HE GAVE OF OLD AND HE ASKED URGENTLY CONCERNING HOBBITS OF WHAT KIND THEY WERE AND WHERE THEY DWELT FOR SAURON KNOWS SAID HE THAT ONE OF THESE WAS KNOWN TO YOU ON A TIME
AT THIS WE WERE GREATLY TROUBLED AND WE GAVE NO ANSWER AND THEN HIS FELL VOICE WAS LOWERED AND HE WOULD HAVE SWEETENED IT IF HE COULD AS A SMALL TOKEN ONLY OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP SAURON ASKS THIS HE SAID THAT YOU SHOULD FIND THIS THIEF SUCH WAS HIS WORD AND GET FROM HIM WILLING OR NO A LITTLE RING THE LEAST OF RINGS THAT ONCE HE STOLE IT IS BUT A TRIFLE THAT SAURON FANCIES AND AN EARNEST OF YOUR GOOD WILL FIND IT AND THREE RINGS THAT THE DWARF SIRES POSSESSED OF OLD SHALL BE RETURNED TO YOU AND THE REALM OF MORIA SHALL BE YOURS FOR EVER FIND ONLY NEWS OF THE THIEF WHETHER HE STILL LIVES AND WHERE AND YOU SHALL HAVE GREAT REWARD AND LASTING FRIENDSHIP FROM THE LORD REFUSE AND THINGS WILL NOT SEEM SO WELL DO YOU REFUSE
AT THAT HIS BREATH CAME LIKE THE HISS OF SNAKES AND ALL WHO STOOD BY SHUDDERED BUT DAIN SAID I SAY NEITHER YEA NOR NAY I MUST CONSIDER THIS MESSAGE AND WHAT IT MEANS UNDER ITS FAIR CLOAK
CONSIDER WELL BUT NOT TOO LONG SAID HE
THE TIME OF MY THOUGHT IS MY OWN TO SPEND ANSWERED DAIN
FOR THE PRESENT SAID HE AND RODE INTO THE DARKNESS
HEAVY HAVE THE HEARTS OF OUR CHIEFTAINS BEEN SINCE THAT NIGHT WE NEEDED NOT THE FELL VOICE OF THE MESSENGER TO WARN US THAT HIS WORDS HELD BOTH MENACE AND DECEIT FOR WE KNEW ALREADY THAT THE POWER THAT HAS REENTERED MORDOR HAS NOT CHANGED AND EVER IT BETRAYED US OF OLD TWICE THE MESSENGER HAS RETURNED AND HAS GONE UNANSWERED THE THIRD AND LAST TIME SO HE SAYS IS SOON TO COME BEFORE THE ENDING OF THE YEAR
AND SO I HAVE BEEN SENT AT LAST BY DAIN TO WARN BILBO THAT HE IS SOUGHT BY THE ENEMY AND TO LEARN IF MAY BE WHY HE DESIRES THIS RING THIS LEAST OF RINGS ALSO WE CRAVE THE ADVICE OF ELROND FOR THE SHADOW GROWS AND DRAWS NEARER WE DISCOVER THAT MESSENGERS HAVE COME ALSO TO KING BRAND IN DALE AND THAT HE IS AFRAID WE FEAR THAT HE MAY YIELD ALREADY WAR IS GATHERING ON HIS EASTERN BORDERS IF WE MAKE NO ANSWER THE ENEMY MAY MOVE MEN OF HIS RULE TO ASSAIL KING BRAND AND DAIN ALSO
YOU HAVE DONE WELL TO COME SAID ELROND YOU WILL HEAR TODAY ALL THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSES OF THE ENEMY THERE IS NAUGHT THAT YOU CAN DO OTHER THAN TO RESIST WITH HOPE OR WITHOUT IT BUT YOU DO NOT STAND ALONE YOU WILL LEARN THAT YOUR TROUBLE IS BUT PART OF THE TROUBLE OF ALL THE WESTERN WORLD THE RING WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE RING THE LEAST OF RINGS THE TRIFLE THAT SAURON FANCIES THAT IS THE DOOM THAT WE MUST DEEM
THAT IS THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH YOU ARE CALLED HITHER CALLED I SAY THOUGH I HAVE NOT CALLED YOU TO ME STRANGERS FROM DISTANT LANDS YOU HAVE COME AND ARE HERE MET IN THIS VERY NICK OF TIME BY CHANCE AS IT MAY SEEM YET IT IS NOT SO BELIEVE RATHER THAT IT IS SO ORDERED THAT WE WHO SIT HERE AND NONE OTHERS MUST NOW FIND COUNSEL FOR THE PERIL OF THE WORLD
NOW THEREFORE THINGS SHALL BE OPENLY SPOKEN THAT HAVE BEEN HIDDEN FROM ALL BUT A FEW UNTIL THIS DAY AND FIRST SO THAT ALL MAY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE PERIL THE TALE OF THE RING SHALL BE TOLD FROM THE BEGINNING EVEN TO THIS PRESENT AND I WILL BEGIN THAT TALE THOUGH OTHERS SHALL END IT
THEN ALL LISTENED WHILE ELROND IN HIS CLEAR VOICE SPOKE OF SAURON AND THE RINGS OF POWER AND THEIR FORGING IN THE SECOND AGE OF THE WORLD LONG AGO A PART OF HIS TALE WAS KNOWN TO SOME THERE BUT THE FULL TALE TO NONE AND MANY EYES WERE TURNED TO ELROND IN FEAR AND WONDER AS HE TOLD OF THE ELVENSMITHS OF EREGION AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP WITH MORIA AND THEIR EAGERNESS FOR KNOWLEDGE BY WHICH SAURON ENSNARED THEM FOR IN THAT TIME HE WAS NOT YET EVIL TO BEHOLD AND THEY RECEIVED HIS AID AND GREW MIGHTY IN CRAFT WHEREAS HE LEARNED ALL THEIR SECRETS AND BETRAYED THEM AND FORGED SECRETLY IN THE MOUNTAIN OF FIRE THE ONE RING TO BE THEIR MASTER BUT CELEBRIMBOR WAS AWARE OF HIM AND HID THE THREE WHICH HE HAD MADE AND THERE WAS WAR AND THE LAND WAS LAID WASTE AND THE GATE OF MORIA WAS SHUT
THEN THROUGH ALL THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED HE TRACED THE RING BUT SINCE THAT HISTORY IS ELSEWHERE RECOUNTED EVEN AS ELROND HIMSELF SET IT DOWN IN HIS BOOKS OF LORE IT IS NOT HERE RECALLED FOR IT IS A LONG TALE FULL OF DEEDS GREAT AND TERRIBLE AND BRIEFLY THOUGH ELROND SPOKE THE SUN RODE UP THE SKY AND THE MORNING WAS PASSING ERE HE CEASED
OF NUMENOR HE SPOKE ITS GLORY AND ITS FALL AND THE RETURN OF THE KINGS OF MEN TO MIDDLEEARTH OUT OF THE DEEPS OF THE SEA BORNE UPON THE WINGS OF STORM THEN ELENDIL THE TALL AND HIS MIGHTY SONS ISILDUR AND ANARION BECAME GREAT LORDS AND THE NORTHREALM THEY MADE IN ARNOR AND THE SOUTHREALM IN GONDOR ABOVE THE MOUTHS OF ANDUIN BUT SAURON OF MORDOR ASSAILED THEM AND THEY MADE THE LAST ALLIANCE OF ELVES AND MEN AND THE HOSTS OF GILGALAD AND ELENDIL WERE MUSTERED IN ARNOR
THEREUPON ELROND PAUSED A WHILE AND SIGHED I REMEMBER WELL THE SPLENDOUR OF THEIR BANNERS HE SAID IT RECALLED TO ME THE GLORY OF THE ELDER DAYS AND THE HOSTS OF BELERIAND SO MANY GREAT PRINCES AND CAPTAINS WERE ASSEMBLED AND YET NOT SO MANY NOR SO FAIR AS WHEN THANGORODRIM WAS BROKEN AND THE ELVES DEEMED THAT EVIL WAS ENDED FOR EVER AND IT WAS NOT SO
YOU REMEMBER SAID FRODO SPEAKING HIS THOUGHT ALOUD IN HIS ASTONISHMENT BUT I THOUGHT HE STAMMERED AS ELROND TURNED TOWARDS HIM I THOUGHT THAT THE FALL OF GILGALAD WAS A LONG AGE AGO
SO IT WAS INDEED ANSWERED ELROND GRAVELY BUT MY MEMORY REACHES BACK EVEN TO THE ELDER DAYS EARENDIL WAS MY SIRE WHO WAS BORN IN GONDOLIN BEFORE ITS FALL AND MY MOTHER WAS ELWING DAUGHTER OF DIOR SON OF LUTHIEN OF DORIATH I HAVE SEEN THREE AGES IN THE WEST OF THE WORLD AND MANY DEFEATS AND MANY FRUITLESS VICTORIES
I WAS THE HERALD OF GILGALAD AND MARCHED WITH HIS HOST I WAS AT THE BATTLE OF DAGORLAD BEFORE THE BLACK GATE OF MORDOR WHERE WE HAD THE MASTERY FOR THE SPEAR OF GILGALAD AND THE SWORD OF ELENDIL AIGLOS AND NARSIL NONE COULD WITHSTAND I BEHELD THE LAST COMBAT ON THE SLOPES OF ORODRUIN WHERE GILGALAD DIED AND ELENDIL FELL AND NARSIL BROKE BENEATH HIM BUT SAURON HIMSELF WAS OVERTHROWN AND ISILDUR CUT THE RING FROM HIS HAND WITH THE HILTSHARD OF HIS FATHERS SWORD AND TOOK IT FOR HIS OWN
AT THIS THE STRANGER BOROMIR BROKE IN SO THAT IS WHAT BECAME OF THE RING HE CRIED IF EVER SUCH A TALE WAS TOLD IN THE SOUTH IT HAS LONG BEEN FORGOTTEN I HAVE HEARD OF THE GREAT RING OF HIM THAT WE DO NOT NAME BUT WE BELIEVED THAT IT PERISHED FROM THE WORLD IN THE RUIN OF HIS FIRST REALM ISILDUR TOOK IT THAT IS TIDINGS INDEED
ALAS YES SAID ELROND ISILDUR TOOK IT AS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAST THEN INTO ORODRUINS FIRE NIGH AT HAND WHERE IT WAS MADE BUT FEW MARKED WHAT ISILDUR DID HE ALONE STOOD BY HIS FATHER IN THAT LAST MORTAL CONTEST AND BY GILGALAD ONLY CIRDAN STOOD AND I BUT ISILDUR WOULD NOT LISTEN TO OUR COUNSEL
THIS I WILL HAVE AS WEREGILD FOR MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER HE SAID AND THEREFORE WHETHER WE WOULD OR NO HE TOOK IT TO TREASURE IT BUT SOON HE WAS BETRAYED BY IT TO HIS DEATH AND SO IT IS NAMED IN THE NORTH ISILDURS BANE YET DEATH MAYBE WAS BETTER THAN WHAT ELSE MIGHT HAVE BEFALLEN HIM
ONLY TO THE NORTH DID THESE TIDINGS COME AND ONLY TO A FEW SMALL WONDER IT IS THAT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THEM BOROMIR FROM THE RUIN OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS WHERE ISILDUR PERISHED THREE MEN ONLY CAME EVER BACK OVER THE MOUNTAINS AFTER LONG WANDERING ONE OF THESE WAS OHTAR THE ESQUIRE OF ISILDUR WHO BORE THE SHARDS OF THE SWORD OF ELENDIL AND HE BROUGHT THEM TO VALANDIL THE HEIR OF ISILDUR WHO BEING BUT A CHILD HAD REMAINED HERE IN RIVENDELL BUT NARSIL WAS BROKEN AND ITS LIGHT EXTINGUISHED AND IT HAS NOT YET BEEN FORGED AGAIN
FRUITLESS DID I CALL THE VICTORY OF THE LAST ALLIANCE NOT WHOLLY SO YET IT DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS END SAURON WAS DIMINISHED BUT NOT DESTROYED HIS RING WAS LOST BUT NOT UNMADE THE DARK TOWER WAS BROKEN BUT ITS FOUNDATIONS WERE NOT REMOVED FOR THEY WERE MADE WITH THE POWER OF THE RING AND WHILE IT REMAINS THEY WILL ENDURE MANY ELVES AND MANY MIGHTY MEN AND MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD PERISHED IN THE WAR ANARION WAS SLAIN AND ISILDUR WAS SLAIN AND GILGALAD AND ELENDIL WERE NO MORE NEVER AGAIN SHALL THERE BE ANY SUCH LEAGUE OF ELVES AND MEN FOR MEN MULTIPLY AND THE FIRSTBORN DECREASE AND THE TWO KINDREDS ARE ESTRANGED AND EVER SINCE THAT DAY THE RACE OF NUMENOR HAS DECAYED AND THE SPAN OF THEIR YEARS HAS LESSENED
IN THE NORTH AFTER THE WAR AND THE SLAUGHTER OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS THE MEN OF WESTERNESSE WERE DIMINISHED AND THEIR CITY OF ANNUMINAS BESIDE LAKE EVENDIM FELL INTO RUIN AND THE HEIRS OF VALANDIL REMOVED AND DWELT AT FORNOST ON THE HIGH NORTH DOWNS AND THAT NOW TOO IS DESOLATE MEN CALL IT DEADMENS DIKE AND THEY FEAR TO TREAD THERE FOR THE FOLK OF ARNOR DWINDLED AND THEIR FOES DEVOURED THEM AND THEIR LORDSHIP PASSED LEAVING ONLY GREEN MOUNDS IN THE GRASSY HILLS
IN THE SOUTH THE REALM OF GONDOR LONG ENDURED AND FOR A WHILE ITS SPLENDOUR GREW RECALLING SOMEWHAT OF THE MIGHT OF NUMENOR ERE IT FELL HIGH TOWERS THAT PEOPLE BUILT AND STRONG PLACES AND HAVENS OF MANY SHIPS AND THE WINGED CROWN OF THE KINGS OF MEN WAS HELD IN AWE BY FOLK OF MANY TONGUES THEIR CHIEF CITY WAS OSGILIATH CITADEL OF THE STARS THROUGH THE MIDST OF WHICH THE RIVER FLOWED AND MINAS ITHIL THEY BUILT TOWER OF THE RISING MOON EASTWARD UPON A SHOULDER OF THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW AND WESTWARD AT THE FEET OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS MINAS ANOR THEY MADE TOWER OF THE SETTING SUN THERE IN THE COURTS OF THE KING GREW A WHITE TREE FROM THE SEED OF THAT TREE WHICH ISILDUR BROUGHT OVER THE DEEP WATERS AND THE SEED OF THAT TREE BEFORE CAME FROM ERESSEA AND BEFORE THAT OUT OF THE UTTERMOST WEST IN THE DAY BEFORE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG
BUT IN THE WEARING OF THE SWIFT YEARS OF MIDDLEEARTH THE LINE OF MENELDIL SON OF ANARION FAILED AND THE TREE WITHERED AND THE BLOOD OF THE NUMENOREANS BECAME MINGLED WITH THAT OF LESSER MEN THEN THE WATCH UPON THE WALLS OF MORDOR SLEPT AND DARK THINGS CREPT BACK TO GORGOROTH AND ON A TIME EVIL THINGS CAME FORTH AND THEY TOOK MINAS ITHIL AND ABODE IN IT AND THEY MADE IT INTO A PLACE OF DREAD AND IT IS CALLED MINAS MORGUL THE TOWER OF SORCERY THEN MINAS ANOR WAS NAMED ANEW MINAS TIRITH THE TOWER OF GUARD AND THESE TWO CITIES WERE EVER AT WAR BUT OSGILIATH WHICH LAY BETWEEN WAS DESERTED AND IN ITS RUINS SHADOWS WALKED
SO IT HAS BEEN FOR MANY LIVES OF MEN BUT THE LORDS OF MINAS TIRITH STILL FIGHT ON DEFYING OUR ENEMIES KEEPING THE PASSAGE OF THE RIVER FROM ARGONATH TO THE SEA AND NOW THAT PART OF THE TALE THAT I SHALL TELL IS DRAWN TO ITS CLOSE FOR IN THE DAYS OF ISILDUR THE RULING RING PASSED OUT OF ALL KNOWLEDGE AND THE THREE WERE RELEASED FROM ITS DOMINION BUT NOW IN THIS LATTER DAY THEY ARE IN PERIL ONCE MORE FOR TO OUR SORROW THE ONE HAS BEEN FOUND OTHERS SHALL SPEAK OF ITS FINDING FOR IN THAT I PLAYED SMALL PART
HE CEASED BUT AT ONCE BOROMIR STOOD UP TALL AND PROUD BEFORE THEM
GIVE ME LEAVE MASTER ELROND SAID HE FIRST TO SAY MORE OF GONDOR FOR VERILY FROM THE LAND OF GONDOR I AM COME AND IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ALL TO KNOW WHAT PASSES THERE FOR FEW I DEEM KNOW OF OUR DEEDS AND THEREFORE GUESS LITTLE OF THEIR PERIL IF WE SHOULD FAIL AT LAST
BELIEVE NOT THAT IN THE LAND OF GONDOR THE BLOOD OF NUMENOR IS SPENT NOR ALL ITS PRIDE AND DIGNITY FORGOTTEN BY OUR VALOUR THE WILD FOLK OF THE EAST ARE STILL RESTRAINED AND THE TERROR OF MORGUL KEPT AT BAY AND THUS ALONE ARE PEACE AND FREEDOM MAINTAINED IN THE LANDS BEHIND US BULWARK OF THE WEST BUT IF THE PASSAGES OF THE RIVER SHOULD BE WON WHAT THEN
YET THAT HOUR MAYBE IS NOT NOW FAR AWAY THE NAMELESS ENEMY HAS ARISEN AGAIN SMOKE RISES ONCE MORE FROM ORODRUIN THAT WE CALL MOUNT DOOM THE POWER OF THE BLACK LAND GROWS AND WE ARE HARD BESET WHEN THE ENEMY RETURNED OUR FOLK WERE DRIVEN FROM ITHILIEN OUR FAIR DOMAIN EAST OF THE RIVER THOUGH WE KEPT A FOOTHOLD THERE AND STRENGTH OF ARMS BUT THIS VERY YEAR IN THE DAYS OF JUNE SUDDEN WAR CAME UPON US OUT OF MORDOR AND WE WERE SWEPT AWAY WE WERE OUTNUMBERED FOR MORDOR HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH THE EASTERLINGS AND THE CRUEL HARADRIM BUT IT WAS NOT BY NUMBERS THAT WE WERE DEFEATED A POWER WAS THERE THAT WE HAVE NOT FELT BEFORE
SOME SAID THAT IT COULD BE SEEN LIKE A GREAT BLACK HORSEMAN A DARK SHADOW UNDER THE MOON WHEREVER HE CAME A MADNESS FILLED OUR FOES BUT FEAR FELL ON OUR BOLDEST SO THAT HORSE AND MAN GAVE WAY AND FLED ONLY A REMNANT OF OUR EASTERN FORCE CAME BACK DESTROYING THE LAST BRIDGE THAT STILL STOOD AMID THE RUINS OF OSGILIATH
I WAS IN THE COMPANY THAT HELD THE BRIDGE UNTIL IT WAS CAST DOWN BEHIND US FOUR ONLY WERE SAVED BY SWIMMING MY BROTHER AND MYSELF AND TWO OTHERS BUT STILL WE FIGHT ON HOLDING ALL THE WEST SHORES OF ANDUIN AND THOSE WHO SHELTER BEHIND US GIVE US PRAISE IF EVER THEY HEAR OUR NAME MUCH PRAISE BUT LITTLE HELP ONLY FROM ROHAN NOW WILL ANY MEN RIDE TO US WHEN WE CALL
IN THIS EVIL HOUR I HAVE COME ON AN ERRAND OVER MANY DANGEROUS LEAGUES TO ELROND A HUNDRED AND TEN DAYS I HAVE JOURNEYED ALL ALONE BUT I DO NOT SEEK ALLIES IN WAR THE MIGHT OF ELROND IS IN WISDOM NOT IN WEAPONS IT IS SAID I COME TO ASK FOR COUNSEL AND THE UNRAVELLING OF HARD WORDS FOR ON THE EVE OF THE SUDDEN ASSAULT A DREAM CAME TO MY BROTHER IN A TROUBLED SLEEP AND AFTERWARDS A LIKE DREAM CAME OFT TO HIM AGAIN AND ONCE TO ME
IN THAT DREAM I THOUGHT THE EASTERN SKY GREW DARK AND THERE WAS A GROWING THUNDER BUT IN THE WEST A PALE LIGHT LINGERED AND OUT OF IT I HEARD A VOICE REMOTE BUT CLEAR CRYING
SEEK FOR THE SWORD THAT WAS BROKEN
IN IMLADRIS IT DWELLS
THERE SHALL BE COUNSELS TAKEN
STRONGER THAN MORGULSPELLS
THERE SHALL BE SHOWN A TOKEN
THAT DOOM IS NEAR AT HAND
FOR ISILDURS BANE SHALL WAKEN
AND THE HALFLING FORTH SHALL STAND

OF THESE WORDS WE COULD UNDERSTAND LITTLE AND WE SPOKE TO OUR FATHER DENETHOR LORD OF MINAS TIRITH WISE IN THE LORE OF GONDOR THIS ONLY WOULD HE SAY THAT IMLADRIS WAS OF OLD THE NAME AMONG THE ELVES OF A FAR NORTHERN DALE WHERE ELROND THE HALFELVEN DWELT GREATEST OF LOREMASTERS THEREFORE MY BROTHER SEEING HOW DESPERATE WAS OUR NEED WAS EAGER TO HEED THE DREAM AND SEEK FOR IMLADRIS BUT SINCE THE WAY WAS FULL OF DOUBT AND DANGER I TOOK THE JOURNEY UPON MYSELF LOTH WAS MY FATHER TO GIVE ME LEAVE AND LONG HAVE I WANDERED BY ROADS FORGOTTEN SEEKING THE HOUSE OF ELROND OF WHICH MANY HAD HEARD BUT FEW KNEW WHERE IT LAY
AND HERE IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND MORE SHALL BE MADE CLEAR TO YOU SAID ARAGORN STANDING UP HE CAST HIS SWORD UPON THE TABLE THAT STOOD BEFORE ELROND AND THE BLADE WAS IN TWO PIECES HERE IS THE SWORD THAT WAS BROKEN HE SAID
AND WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH MINAS TIRITH ASKED BOROMIR LOOKING IN WONDER AT THE LEAN FACE OF THE RANGER AND HIS WEATHERSTAINED CLOAK
HE IS ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN SAID ELROND AND HE IS DESCENDED THROUGH MANY FATHERS FROM ISILDUR ELENDILS SON OF MINAS ITHIL HE IS THE CHIEF OF THE DUNEDAIN IN THE NORTH AND FEW ARE NOW LEFT OF THAT FOLK
THEN IT BELONGS TO YOU AND NOT TO ME AT ALL CRIED FRODO IN AMAZEMENT SPRINGING TO HIS FEET AS IF HE EXPECTED THE RING TO BE DEMANDED AT ONCE
IT DOES NOT BELONG TO EITHER OF US SAID ARAGORN BUT IT HAS BEEN ORDAINED THAT YOU SHOULD HOLD IT FOR A WHILE
BRING OUT THE RING FRODO SAID GANDALF SOLEMNLY THE TIME HAS COME HOLD IT UP AND THEN BOROMIR WILL UNDERSTAND THE REMAINDER OF HIS RIDDLE
THERE WAS A HUSH AND ALL TURNED THEIR EYES ON FRODO HE WAS SHAKEN BY A SUDDEN SHAME AND FEAR AND HE FELT A GREAT RELUCTANCE TO REVEAL THE RING AND A LOATHING OF ITS TOUCH HE WISHED HE WAS FAR AWAY THE RING GLEAMED AND FLICKERED AS HE HELD IT UP BEFORE THEM IN HIS TREMBLING HAND
BEHOLD ISILDURS BANE SAID ELROND
BOROMIRS EYES GLINTED AS HE GAZED AT THE GOLDEN THING THE HALFLING HE MUTTERED IS THEN THE DOOM OF MINAS TIRITH COME AT LAST BUT WHY THEN SHOULD WE SEEK A BROKEN SWORD
THE WORDS WERE NOT THE DOOM OF MINAS TIRITH SAID ARAGORN BUT DOOM AND GREAT DEEDS ARE INDEED AT HAND FOR THE SWORD THAT WAS BROKEN IS THE SWORD OF ELENDIL THAT BROKE BENEATH HIM WHEN HE FELL IT HAS BEEN TREASURED BY HIS HEIRS WHEN ALL OTHER HEIRLOOMS WERE LOST FOR IT WAS SPOKEN OF OLD AMONG US THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE AGAIN WHEN THE RING ISILDURS BANE WAS FOUND NOW YOU HAVE SEEN THE SWORD THAT YOU HAVE SOUGHT WHAT WOULD YOU ASK DO YOU WISH FOR THE HOUSE OF ELENDIL TO RETURN TO THE LAND OF GONDOR
I WAS NOT SENT TO BEG ANY BOON BUT TO SEEK ONLY THE MEANING OF A RIDDLE ANSWERED BOROMIR PROUDLY YET WE ARE HARD PRESSED AND THE SWORD OF ELENDIL WOULD BE A HELP BEYOND OUR HOPE  IF SUCH A THING COULD INDEED RETURN OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST HE LOOKED AGAIN AT ARAGORN AND DOUBT WAS IN HIS EYES
FRODO FELT BILBO STIR IMPATIENTLY AT HIS SIDE EVIDENTLY HE WAS ANNOYED ON HIS FRIENDS BEHALF STANDING SUDDENLY UP HE BURST OUT
ALL THAT IS GOLD DOES NOT GLITTER
NOT ALL THOSE WHO WANDER ARE LOST
THE OLD THAT IS STRONG DOES NOT WITHER
DEEP ROOTS ARE NOT REACHED BY THE FROST

FROM THE ASHES A FIRE SHALL BE WOKEN
A LIGHT FROM THE SHADOWS SHALL SPRING
RENEWED SHALL BE BLADE THAT WAS BROKEN
THE CROWNLESS AGAIN SHALL BE KING

NOT VERY GOOD PERHAPS BUT TO THE POINT  IF YOU NEED MORE BEYOND THE WORD OF ELROND IF THAT WAS WORTH A JOURNEY OF A HUNDRED AND TEN DAYS TO HEAR YOU HAD BEST LISTEN TO IT HE SAT DOWN WITH A SNORT
I MADE THAT UP MYSELF HE WHISPERED TO FRODO FOR THE DUNADAN A LONG TIME AGO WHEN HE FIRST TOLD ME ABOUT HIMSELF I ALMOST WISH THAT MY ADVENTURES WERE NOT OVER AND THAT I COULD GO WITH HIM WHEN HIS DAY COMES
ARAGORN SMILED AT HIM THEN HE TURNED TO BOROMIR AGAIN FOR MY PART I FORGIVE YOUR DOUBT HE SAID LITTLE DO I RESEMBLE THE FIGURES OF ELENDIL AND ISILDUR AS THEY STAND CARVEN IN THEIR MAJESTY IN THE HALLS OF DENETHOR I AM BUT THE HEIR OF ISILDUR NOT ISILDUR HIMSELF I HAVE HAD A HARD LIFE AND A LONG AND THE LEAGUES THAT LIE BETWEEN HERE AND GONDOR ARE A SMALL PART IN THE COUNT OF MY JOURNEYS I HAVE CROSSED MANY MOUNTAINS AND MANY RIVERS AND TRODDEN MANY PLAINS EVEN INTO THE FAR COUNTRIES OF RHUN AND HARAD WHERE THE STARS ARE STRANGE
BUT MY HOME SUCH AS I HAVE IS IN THE NORTH FOR HERE THE HEIRS OF VALANDIL HAVE EVER DWELT IN LONG LINE UNBROKEN FROM FATHER UNTO SON FOR MANY GENERATIONS OUR DAYS HAVE DARKENED AND WE HAVE DWINDLED BUT EVER THE SWORD HAS PASSED TO A NEW KEEPER AND THIS I WILL SAY TO YOU BOROMIR ERE I END LONELY MEN ARE WE RANGERS OF THE WILD HUNTERS  BUT HUNTERS EVER OF THE SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY FOR THEY ARE FOUND IN MANY PLACES NOT IN MORDOR ONLY
IF GONDOR BOROMIR HAS BEEN A STALWART TOWER WE HAVE PLAYED ANOTHER PART MANY EVIL THINGS THERE ARE THAT YOUR STRONG WALLS AND BRIGHT SWORDS DO NOT STAY YOU KNOW LITTLE OF THE LANDS BEYOND YOUR BOUNDS PEACE AND FREEDOM DO YOU SAY THE NORTH WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEM LITTLE BUT FOR US FEAR WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THEM BUT WHEN DARK THINGS COME FROM THE HOUSELESS HILLS OR CREEP FROM SUNLESS WOODS THEY FLY FROM US WHAT ROADS WOULD ANY DARE TO TREAD WHAT SAFETY WOULD THERE BE IN QUIET LANDS OR IN THE HOMES OF SIMPLE MEN AT NIGHT IF THE DUNEDAIN WERE ASLEEP OR WERE ALL GONE INTO THE GRAVE
AND YET LESS THANKS HAVE WE THAN YOU TRAVELLERS SCOWL AT US AND COUNTRYMEN GIVE US SCORNFUL NAMES STRIDER I AM TO ONE FAT MAN WHO LIVES WITHIN A DAYS MARCH OF FOES THAT WOULD FREEZE HIS HEART OR LAY HIS LITTLE TOWN IN RUIN IF HE WERE NOT GUARDED CEASELESSLY YET WE WOULD NOT HAVE IT OTHERWISE IF SIMPLE FOLK ARE FREE FROM CARE AND FEAR SIMPLE THEY WILL BE AND WE MUST BE SECRET TO KEEP THEM SO THAT HAS BEEN THE TASK OF MY KINDRED WHILE THE YEARS HAVE LENGTHENED AND THE GRASS HAS GROWN
BUT NOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING ONCE AGAIN A NEW HOUR COMES ISILDURS BANE IS FOUND BATTLE IS AT HAND THE SWORD SHALL BE REFORGED I WILL COME TO MINAS TIRITH
ISILDURS BANE IS FOUND YOU SAY SAID BOROMIR I HAVE SEEN A BRIGHT RING IN THE HALFLINGS HAND BUT ISILDUR PERISHED ERE THIS AGE OF THE WORLD BEGAN THEY SAY HOW DO THE WISE KNOW THAT THIS RING IS HIS AND HOW HAS IT PASSED DOWN THE YEARS UNTIL IT IS BROUGHT HITHER BY SO STRANGE A MESSENGER
THAT SHALL BE TOLD SAID ELROND
BUT NOT YET I BEG MASTER SAID BILBO ALREADY THE SUN IS CLIMBING TO NOON AND I FEEL THE NEED OF SOMETHING TO STRENGTHEN ME
I HAD NOT NAMED YOU SAID ELROND SMILING BUT I DO SO NOW COME TELL US YOUR TALE AND IF YOU HAVE NOT YET CAST YOUR STORY INTO VERSE YOU MAY TELL IT IN PLAIN WORDS THE BRIEFER THE SOONER SHALL YOU BE REFRESHED
VERY WELL SAID BILBO I WILL DO AS YOU BID BUT I WILL NOW TELL THE TRUE STORY AND IF SOME HERE HAVE HEARD ME TELL IT OTHERWISE  HE LOOKED SIDELONG AT GLOIN  I ASK THEM TO FORGET IT AND FORGIVE ME I ONLY WISHED TO CLAIM THE TREASURE AS MY VERY OWN IN THOSE DAYS AND TO BE RID OF THE NAME OF THIEF THAT WAS PUT ON ME BUT PERHAPS I UNDERSTAND THINGS A LITTLE BETTER NOW ANYWAY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
TO SOME THERE BILBOS TALE WAS WHOLLY NEW AND THEY LISTENED WITH AMAZEMENT WHILE THE OLD HOBBIT ACTUALLY NOT AT ALL DISPLEASED RECOUNTED HIS ADVENTURE WITH GOLLUM AT FULL LENGTH HE DID NOT OMIT A SINGLE RIDDLE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALSO AN ACCOUNT OF HIS PARTY AND DISAPPEARANCE FROM THE SHIRE IF HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED BUT ELROND RAISED HIS HAND
WELL TOLD MY FRIEND HE SAID BUT THAT IS ENOUGH AT THIS TIME FOR THE MOMENT IT SUFFICES TO KNOW THAT THE RING PASSED TO FRODO YOUR HEIR LET HIM NOW SPEAK
THEN LESS WILLINGLY THAN BILBO FRODO TOLD OF ALL HIS DEALINGS WITH THE RING FROM THE DAY THAT IT PASSED INTO HIS KEEPING EVERY STEP OF HIS JOURNEY FROM HOBBITON TO THE FORD OF BRUINEN WAS QUESTIONED AND CONSIDERED AND EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD RECALL CONCERNING THE BLACK RIDERS WAS EXAMINED AT LAST HE SAT DOWN AGAIN
NOT BAD BILBO SAID TO HIM YOU WOULD HAVE MADE A GOOD STORY OF IT IF THEY HADNT KEPT ON INTERRUPTING I TRIED TO MAKE A FEW NOTES BUT WE SHALL HAVE TO GO OVER IT ALL AGAIN TOGETHER SOME TIME IF I AM TO WRITE IT UP THERE ARE WHOLE CHAPTERS OF STUFF BEFORE YOU EVER GOT HERE
YES IT MADE QUITE A LONG TALE ANSWERED FRODO BUT THE STORY STILL DOES NOT SEEM COMPLETE TO ME I STILL WANT TO KNOW A GOOD DEAL ESPECIALLY ABOUT GANDALF
GALDOR OF THE HAVENS WHO SAT NEAR BY OVERHEARD HIM YOU SPEAK FOR ME ALSO HE CRIED AND TURNING TO ELROND HE SAID THE WISE MAY HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE HALFLINGS TROVE IS INDEED THE GREAT RING OF LONG DEBATE UNLIKELY THOUGH THAT MAY SEEM TO THOSE WHO KNOW LESS BUT MAY WE NOT HEAR THE PROOFS AND I WOULD ASK THIS ALSO WHAT OF SARUMAN HE IS LEARNED IN THE LORE OF THE RINGS YET HE IS NOT AMONG US WHAT IS HIS COUNSELIF HE KNOWS THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD
THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK GALDOR ARE BOUND TOGETHER SAID ELROND I HAD NOT OVERLOOKED THEM AND THEY SHALL BE ANSWERED BUT THESE THINGS IT IS THE PART OF GANDALF TO MAKE CLEAR AND I CALL UPON HIM LAST FOR IT IS THE PLACE OF HONOUR AND IN ALL THIS MATTER HE HAS BEEN THE CHIEF
SOME GALDOR SAID GANDALF WOULD THINK THE TIDINGS OF GLOIN AND THE PURSUIT OF FRODO PROOF ENOUGH THAT THE HALFLINGS TROVE IS A THING OF GREAT WORTH TO THE ENEMY YET IT IS A RING WHAT THEN THE NINE THE NAZGUL KEEP THE SEVEN ARE TAKEN OR DESTROYED AT THIS GLOIN STIRRED BUT DID NOT SPEAK THE THREE WE KNOW OF WHAT THEN IS THIS ONE THAT HE DESIRES SO MUCH
THERE IS INDEED A WIDE WASTE OF TIME BETWEEN THE RIVER AND THE MOUNTAIN BETWEEN THE LOSS AND THE FINDING BUT THE GAP IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WISE HAS BEEN FILLED AT LAST YET TOO SLOWLY FOR THE ENEMY HAS BEEN CLOSE BEHIND CLOSER EVEN THAN I FEARED AND WELL IS IT THAT NOT UNTIL THIS YEAR THIS VERY SUMMER AS IT SEEMS DID HE LEARN THE FULL TRUTH
SOME HERE WILL REMEMBER THAT MANY YEARS AGO I MYSELF DARED TO PASS THE DOORS OF THE NECROMANCER IN DOL GULDUR AND SECRETLY EXPLORED HIS WAYS AND FOUND THUS THAT OUR FEARS WERE TRUE HE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SAURON OUR ENEMY OF OLD AT LENGTH TAKING SHAPE AND POWER AGAIN SOME TOO WILL REMEMBER ALSO THAT SARUMAN DISSUADED US FROM OPEN DEEDS AGAINST HIM AND FOR LONG WE WATCHED HIM ONLY YET AT LAST AS HIS SHADOW GREW SARUMAN YIELDED AND THE COUNCIL PUT FORTH ITS STRENGTH AND DROVE THE EVIL OUT OF MIRKWOOD AND THAT WAS IN THE VERY YEAR OF THE FINDING OF THIS RING A STRANGE CHANCE IF CHANCE IT WAS
BUT WE WERE TOO LATE AS ELROND FORESAW SAURON ALSO HAD WATCHED US AND HAD LONG PREPARED AGAINST OUR STROKE GOVERNING MORDOR FROM AFAR THROUGH MINAS MORGUL WHERE HIS NINE SERVANTS DWELT UNTIL ALL WAS READY THEN HE GAVE WAY BEFORE US BUT ONLY FEIGNED TO FLEE AND SOON AFTER CAME TO THE DARK TOWER AND OPENLY DECLARED HIMSELF THEN FOR THE LAST TIME THE COUNCIL MET FOR NOW WE LEARNED THAT HE WAS SEEKING EVER MORE EAGERLY FOR THE ONE WE FEARED THEN THAT HE HAD SOME NEWS OF IT THAT WE KNEW NOTHING OF BUT SARUMAN SAID NAY AND REPEATED WHAT HE HAD SAID TO US BEFORE THAT THE ONE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE FOUND IN MIDDLEEARTH
AT THE WORST SAID HE OUR ENEMY KNOWS THAT WE HAVE IT NOT AND THAT IT STILL IS LOST BUT WHAT WAS LOST MAY YET BE FOUND HE THINKS FEAR NOT HIS HOPE WILL CHEAT HIM HAVE I NOT EARNESTLY STUDIED THIS MATTER INTO ANDUIN THE GREAT IT FELL AND LONG AGO WHILE SAURON SLEPT IT WAS ROLLED DOWN THE RIVER TO THE SEA THERE LET IT LIE UNTIL THE END
GANDALF FELL SILENT GAZING EASTWARD FROM THE PORCH TO THE FAR PEAKS OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AT WHOSE GREAT ROOTS THE PERIL OF THE WORLD HAD SO LONG LAIN HIDDEN HE SIGHED
THERE I WAS AT FAULT HE SAID I WAS LULLED BY THE WORDS OF SARUMAN THE WISE BUT I SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT FOR THE TRUTH SOONER AND OUR PERIL WOULD NOW BE LESS
WE WERE ALL AT FAULT SAID ELROND AND BUT FOR YOUR VIGILANCE THE DARKNESS MAYBE WOULD ALREADY BE UPON US BUT SAY ON

FROM THE FIRST MY HEART MISGAVE ME AGAINST ALL REASON THAT I KNEW SAID GANDALF AND I DESIRED TO KNOW HOW THIS THING CAME TO GOLLUM AND HOW LONG HE HAD POSSESSED IT SO I SET A WATCH FOR HIM GUESSING THAT HE WOULD ERE LONG COME FORTH FROM HIS DARKNESS TO SEEK FOR HIS TREASURE HE CAME BUT HE ESCAPED AND WAS NOT FOUND AND THEN ALAS I LET THE MATTER REST WATCHING AND WAITING ONLY AS WE HAVE TOO OFTEN DONE
TIME PASSED WITH MANY CARES UNTIL MY DOUBTS WERE AWAKENED AGAIN TO SUDDEN FEAR WHENCE CAME THE HOBBITS RING WHAT IF MY FEAR WAS TRUE SHOULD BE DONE WITH IT THOSE THINGS I MUST DECIDE BUT I SPOKE YET OF MY DREAD TO NONE KNOWING THE PERIL OF AN UNTIMELY WHISPER IF IT WENT ASTRAY IN ALL THE LONG WARS WITH THE DARK TOWER TREASON HAS EVER BEEN OUR GREATEST FOE
THAT WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO SOON I BECAME AWARE THAT SPIES OF MANY SORTS EVEN BEASTS AND BIRDS WERE GATHERED ROUND THE SHIRE AND MY FEAR GREW I CALLED FOR THE HELP OF THE DUNEDAIN AND THEIR WATCH WAS DOUBLED AND I OPENED MY HEART TO ARAGORN THE HEIR OF ISILDUR
AND I SAID ARAGORN COUNSELLED THAT WE SHOULD HUNT FOR GOLLUM TOO LATE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM AND SINCE IT SEEMED FIT THAT ISILDURS HEIR SHOULD LABOUR TO REPAIR ISILDURS FAULT I WENT WITH GANDALF ON THE LONG AND HOPELESS SEARCH
THEN GANDALF TOLD HOW THEY HAD EXPLORED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF WILDERLAND DOWN EVEN TO THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW AND THE FENCES OF MORDOR THERE WE HAD RUMOUR OF HIM AND WE GUESS THAT HE DWELT THERE LONG IN THE DARK HILLS BUT WE NEVER FOUND HIM AND AT LAST I DESPAIRED AND THEN IN MY DESPAIR I THOUGHT AGAIN OF A TEST THAT MIGHT MAKE THE FINDING OF GOLLUM UNNEEDED THE RING ITSELF MIGHT TELL IF IT WERE THE ONE THE MEMORY OF WORDS AT THE COUNCIL CAME BACK TO ME WORDS OF SARUMAN HALFHEEDED AT THE TIME I HEARD THEM NOW CLEARLY IN MY HEART
THE NINE THE SEVEN AND THE THREE HE SAID HAD EACH THEIR PROPER GEM NOT SO THE ONE IT WAS ROUND AND UNADORNED AS IT WERE ONE OF THE LESSER RINGS BUT ITS MAKER SET MARKS UPON IT THAT THE SKILLED MAYBE COULD STILL SEE AND READ
WHAT THOSE MARKS WERE HE HAD NOT SAID WHO NOW WOULD KNOW THE MAKER AND SARUMAN BUT GREAT THOUGH HIS LORE MAY BE IT MUST HAVE A SOURCE WHAT HAND SAVE SAURONS EVER HELD THIS THING ERE IT WAS LOST THE HAND OF ISILDUR ALONE
WITH THAT THOUGHT I FORSOOK THE CHASE AND PASSED SWIFTLY TO GONDOR IN FORMER DAYS THE MEMBERS OF MY ORDER HAD BEEN WELL RECEIVED THERE BUT SARUMAN MOST OF ALL OFTEN HE HAD BEEN FOR LONG THE GUEST OF THE LORDS OF THE CITY LESS WELCOME DID THE LORD DENETHOR SHOW ME THEN THAN OF OLD AND GRUDGINGLY HE PERMITTED ME TO SEARCH AMONG HIS HOARDED SCROLLS AND BOOKS
IF INDEED YOU LOOK ONLY AS YOU SAY FOR RECORDS OF ANCIENT DAYS AND THE BEGINNINGS OF THE CITY READ ON HE SAID FOR TO ME WHAT WAS IS LESS DARK THAN WHAT IS TO COME AND THAT IS MY CARE BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE MORE SKILL EVEN THAN SARUMAN WHO HAS STUDIED HERE LONG YOU WILL FIND NAUGHT THAT IS NOT WELL KNOWN TO ME WHO AM MASTER OF THE LORE OF THIS CITY
SO SAID DENETHOR AND YET THERE LIE IN HIS HOARDS MANY RECORDS THAT FEW NOW CAN READ EVEN OF THE LOREMASTERS FOR THEIR SCRIPTS AND TONGUES HAVE BECOME DARK TO LATER MEN AND BOROMIR THERE LIES IN MINAS TIRITH STILL UNREAD I GUESS BY ANY SAVE SARUMAN AND MYSELF SINCE THE KINGS FAILED A SCROLL THAT ISILDUR MADE HIMSELF FOR ISILDUR DID NOT MARCH AWAY STRAIGHT FROM THE WAR IN MORDOR AS SOME HAVE TOLD THE TALE
SOME IN THE NORTH MAYBE BOROMIR BROKE IN ALL KNOW IN GONDOR THAT HE WENT FIRST TO MINAS ANOR AND DWELT A WHILE WITH HIS NEPHEW MENELDIL INSTRUCTING HIM BEFORE HE COMMITTED TO HIM THE RULE OF THE SOUTH KINGDOM IN THAT TIME HE PLANTED THERE THE LAST SAPLING OF THE WHITE TREE IN MEMORY OF HIS BROTHER
BUT IN THAT TIME ALSO HE MADE THIS SCROLL SAID GANDALF AND THAT IS NOT REMEMBERED IN GONDOR IT WOULD SEEM FOR THIS SCROLL CONCERNS THE RING AND THUS WROTE ISILDUR THEREIN
THE GREAT RING SHALL GO NOW TO BE AN HEIRLOOM OF THE NORTH KINGDOM BUT RECORDS OF IT SHALL BE LEFT IN GONDOR WHERE ALSO DWELL THE HEIRS OF ELENDIL LEST A TIME COME WHEN THE MEMORY OF THESE GREAT MATTERS SHALL GROW DIM
AND AFTER THESE WORDS ISILDUR DESCRIBED THE RING SUCH AS HE FOUND IT
IT WAS HOT WHEN I FIRST TOOK IT HOT AS A GLEDE AND MY HAND WAS SCORCHED SO THAT I DOUBT IF EVER AGAIN I SHALL BE FREE OF THE PAIN OF IT YET EVEN AS I WRITE IT IS COOLED AND IT SEEMETH TO SHRINK THOUGH IT LOSETH NEITHER ITS BEAUTY NOR ITS SHAPE ALREADY THE WRITING UPON IT WHICH AT FIRST WAS AS CLEAR AS RED FLAME FADETH AND IS NOW ONLY BARELY TO BE READ IT IS FASHIONED IN AN ELVENSCRIPT OF EREGION FOR THEY HAVE NO LETTERS IN MORDOR FOR SUCH SUBTLE WORK BUT THE LANGUAGE IS UNKNOWN TO ME I DEEM IT TO BE A TONGUE OF THE BLACK LAND SINCE IT IS FOUL AND UNCOUTH WHAT EVIL IT SAITH I DO NOT KNOW BUT I TRACE HERE A COPY OF IT LEST IT FADE BEYOND RECALL THE RING MISSETH MAYBE THE HEAT OF SAURONS HAND WHICH WAS BLACK AND YET BURNED LIKE FIRE AND SO GILGALAD WAS DESTROYED AND MAYBE WERE THE GOLD MADE HOT AGAIN THE WRITING WOULD BE REFRESHED BUT FOR MY PART I WILL RISK NO HURT TO THIS THING OF ALL THE WORKS OF SAURON THE ONLY FAIR IT IS PRECIOUS TO ME THOUGH I BUY IT WITH GREAT PAIN
WHEN I READ THESE WORDS MY QUEST WAS ENDED FOR THE TRACED WRITING WAS INDEED AS ISILDUR GUESSED IN THE TONGUE OF MORDOR AND THE SERVANTS OF THE TOWER AND WHAT WAS SAID THEREIN WAS ALREADY KNOWN FOR IN THE DAY THAT SAURON FIRST PUT ON THE ONE CELEBRIMBOR MAKER OF THE THREE WAS AWARE OF HIM AND FROM AFAR HE HEARD HIM SPEAK THESE WORDS AND SO HIS EVIL PURPOSES WERE REVEALED
AT ONCE I TOOK MY LEAVE OF DENETHOR BUT EVEN AS I WENT NORTHWARDS MESSAGES CAME TO ME OUT OF LORIEN THAT ARAGORN HAD PASSED THAT WAY AND THAT HE HAD FOUND THE CREATURE CALLED GOLLUM THEREFORE I WENT FIRST TO MEET HIM AND HEAR HIS TALE INTO WHAT DEADLY PERILS HE HAD GONE ALONE I DARED NOT GUESS
THERE IS LITTLE NEED TO TELL OF THEM SAID ARAGORN IF A MAN MUST NEEDS WALK IN SIGHT OF THE BLACK GATE OR TREAD THE DEADLY FLOWERS OF MORGUL VALE THEN PERILS HE WILL HAVE I TOO DESPAIRED AT LAST AND I BEGAN MY HOMEWARD JOURNEY AND THEN BY FORTUNE I CAME SUDDENLY ON WHAT I SOUGHT THE MARKS OF SOFT FEET BESIDE A MUDDY POOL BUT NOW THE TRAIL WAS FRESH AND SWIFT AND IT LED NOT TO MORDOR BUT AWAY ALONG THE SKIRTS OF THE DEAD MARSHES I FOLLOWED IT AND THEN I HAD HIM LURKING BY A STAGNANT MERE PEERING IN THE WATER AS THE DARK EVE FELL I CAUGHT HIM GOLLUM HE WAS COVERED WITH GREEN SLIME HE WILL NEVER LOVE ME I FEAR FOR HE BIT ME AND I WAS NOT GENTLE NOTHING MORE DID I EVER GET FROM HIS MOUTH THAN THE MARKS OF HIS TEETH I DEEMED IT THE WORST PART OF ALL MY JOURNEY THE ROAD BACK WATCHING HIM DAY AND NIGHT MAKING HIM WALK BEFORE ME WITH A HALTER ON HIS NECK GAGGED UNTIL HE WAS TAMED BY LACK OF DRINK AND FOOD DRIVING HIM EVER TOWARDS MIRKWOOD I BROUGHT HIM THERE AT LAST AND GAVE HIM TO THE ELVES FOR WE HAD AGREED THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE AND I WAS GLAD TO BE RID OF HIS COMPANY FOR HE STANK FOR MY PART I HOPE NEVER TO LOOK UPON HIM AGAIN BUT GANDALF CAME AND ENDURED LONG SPEECH WITH HIM
YES LONG AND WEARY SAID GANDALF BUT NOT WITHOUT PROFIT FOR ONE THING THE TALE HE TOLD OF HIS LOSS AGREED WITH THAT WHICH BILBO HAS NOW TOLD OPENLY FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT THAT MATTERED LITTLE SINCE I HAD ALREADY GUESSED IT BUT I LEARNED THEN FIRST THAT GOLLUMS RING CAME OUT OF THE GREAT RIVER NIGH TO THE GLADDEN FIELDS AND I LEARNED ALSO THAT HE HAD POSSESSED IT LONG MANY LIVES OF HIS SMALL KIND THE POWER OF THE RING HAD LENGTHENED HIS YEARS FAR BEYOND THEIR SPAN BUT THAT POWER ONLY THE GREAT RINGS WIELD
AND IF THAT IS NOT PROOF ENOUGH GALDOR THERE IS THE OTHER TEST THAT I SPOKE OF UPON THIS VERY RING WHICH YOU HAVE HERE SEEN HELD ALOFT ROUND AND UNADORNED THE LETTERS THAT ISILDUR REPORTED MAY STILL BE READ IF ONE HAS THE STRENGTH OF WILL TO SET THE GOLDEN THING IN THE FIRE A WHILE THAT I HAVE DONE AND THIS I HAVE READ
ASH NAZG DURBATULUK ASH NAZG GIMBATUL ASH NAZG THRAKATULUK AGH BURZUMISHI KRIMPATUL
THE CHANGE IN THE WIZARDS VOICE WAS ASTOUNDING SUDDENLY IT BECAME MENACING POWERFUL HARSH AS STONE A SHADOW SEEMED TO PASS OVER THE HIGH SUN AND THE PORCH FOR A MOMENT GREW DARK ALL TREMBLED AND THE ELVES STOPPED THEIR EARS
NEVER BEFORE HAS ANY VOICE DARED TO UTTER THE WORDS OF THAT TONGUE IN IMLADRIS GANDALF THE GREY SAID ELROND AS THE SHADOW PASSED AND THE COMPANY BREATHED ONCE MORE
AND LET US HOPE THAT NONE WILL EVER SPEAK IT HERE AGAIN ANSWERED GANDALF NONETHELESS I DO NOT ASK YOUR PARDON MASTER ELROND FOR IF THAT TONGUE IS NOT SOON TO BE HEARD IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WEST THEN LET ALL PUT DOUBT ASIDE THAT THIS THING IS INDEED WHAT THE WISE HAVE DECLARED THE TREASURE OF THE ENEMY FRAUGHT WITH ALL HIS MALICE AND IN IT LIES A GREAT PART OF HIS STRENGTH OF OLD OUT OF THE BLACK YEARS COME THE WORDS THAT THE SMITHS OF EREGION HEARD AND KNEW THAT THEY HAD BEEN BETRAYED
ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL ONE RING TO FIND THEM ONE RING TO BRING THEM ALL AND IN THE DARKNESS BIND THEM
KNOW ALSO MY FRIENDS THAT I LEARNED MORE YET FROM GOLLUM HE WAS LOTH TO SPEAK AND HIS TALE WAS UNCLEAR BUT IT IS BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT HE WENT TO MORDOR AND THERE ALL THAT HE KNEW WAS FORCED FROM HIM THUS THE ENEMY KNOWS NOW THAT THE ONE IS FOUND THAT IT WAS LONG IN THE SHIRE AND SINCE HIS SERVANTS HAVE PURSUED IT ALMOST TO OUR DOOR HE SOON WILL KNOW ALREADY HE MAY KNOW EVEN AS I SPEAK THAT WE HAVE IT HERE
ALL SAT SILENT FOR A WHILE UNTIL AT LENGTH BOROMIR SPOKE HE IS A SMALL THING YOU SAY THIS GOLLUM SMALL BUT GREAT IN MISCHIEF WHAT BECAME OF HIM TO WHAT DOOM DID YOU PUT HIM
HE IS IN PRISON BUT NO WORSE SAID ARAGORN HE HAD SUFFERED MUCH THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS TORMENTED AND THE FEAR OF SAURON LIES BLACK ON HIS HEART STILL I FOR ONE AM GLAD THAT HE IS SAFELY KEPT BY THE WATCHFUL ELVES OF MIRKWOOD HIS MALICE IS GREAT AND GIVES HIM A STRENGTH HARDLY TO BE BELIEVED IN ONE SO LEAN AND WITHERED HE COULD WORK MUCH MISCHIEF STILL IF HE WERE FREE AND I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE MORDOR ON SOME EVIL ERRAND
ALAS ALAS CRIED LEGOLAS AND IN HIS FAIR ELVISH FACE THERE WAS GREAT DISTRESS THE TIDINGS THAT I WAS SENT TO BRING MUST NOW BE TOLD THEY ARE NOT GOOD BUT ONLY HERE HAVE I LEARNED HOW EVIL THEY MAY SEEM TO THIS COMPANY SMEAGOL WHO IS NOW CALLED GOLLUM HAS ESCAPED
ESCAPED CRIED ARAGORN THAT IS ILL NEWS INDEED WE SHALL ALL RUE IT BITTERLY I FEAR HOW CAME THE FOLK OF THRANDUIL TO FAIL IN THEIR TRUST
NOT THROUGH LACK OF WATCHFULNESS SAID LEGOLAS BUT PERHAPS THROUGH OVERKINDLINESS AND WE FEAR THAT THE PRISONER HAD AID FROM OTHERS AND THAT MORE IS KNOWN OF OUR DOINGS THAN WE COULD WISH WE GUARDED THIS CREATURE DAY AND NIGHT AT GANDALFS BIDDING MUCH THOUGH WE WEARIED OF THE TASK BUT GANDALF BADE US HOPE STILL FOR HIS CURE AND WE HAD NOT THE HEART TO KEEP HIM EVER IN DUNGEONS UNDER THE EARTH WHERE HE WOULD FALL BACK INTO HIS OLD BLACK THOUGHTS
YOU WERE LESS TENDER TO ME SAID GLOIN WITH A FLASH OF HIS EYES AS OLD MEMORIES WERE STIRRED OF HIS IMPRISONMENT IN THE DEEP PLACES OF THE ELVENKINGS HALLS
NOW COME SAID GANDALF PRAY DO NOT INTERRUPT MY GOOD GLOIN THAT WAS A REGRETTABLE MISUNDERSTANDING LONG SET RIGHT IF ALL THE GRIEVANCES THAT STAND BETWEEN ELVES AND DWARVES ARE TO BE BROUGHT UP HERE WE MAY AS WELL ABANDON THIS COUNCIL
GLOIN ROSE AND BOWED AND LEGOLAS CONTINUED IN THE DAYS OF FAIR WEATHER WE LED GOLLUM THROUGH THE WOODS AND THERE WAS A HIGH TREE STANDING ALONE FAR FROM THE OTHERS WHICH HE LIKED TO CLIMB OFTEN WE LET HIM MOUNT UP TO THE HIGHEST BRANCHES UNTIL HE FELT THE FREE WIND BUT WE SET A GUARD AT THE TREES FOOT ONE DAY HE REFUSED TO COME DOWN AND THE GUARDS HAD NO MIND TO CLIMB AFTER HIM HE HAD LEARNED THE TRICK OF CLINGING TO BOUGHS WITH HIS FEET AS WELL AS WITH HIS HANDS SO THEY SAT BY THE TREE FAR INTO THE NIGHT
IT WAS THAT VERY NIGHT OF SUMMER YET MOONLESS AND STARLESS THAT ORCS CAME ON US AT UNAWARES WE DROVE THEM OFF AFTER SOME TIME THEY WERE MANY AND FIERCE BUT THEY CAME FROM OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND WERE UNUSED TO THE WOODS WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WE FOUND THAT GOLLUM WAS GONE AND HIS GUARDS WERE SLAIN OR TAKEN IT THEN SEEMED PLAIN TO US THAT THE ATTACK HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIS RESCUE AND THAT HE KNEW OF IT BEFOREHAND HOW THAT WAS CONTRIVED WE CANNOT GUESS BUT GOLLUM IS CUNNING AND THE SPIES OF THE ENEMY ARE MANY THE DARK THINGS THAT WERE DRIVEN OUT IN THE YEAR OF THE DRAGONS FALL HAVE RETURNED IN GREATER NUMBERS AND MIRKWOOD IS AGAIN AN EVIL PLACE SAVE WHERE OUR REALM IS MAINTAINED
WE HAVE FAILED TO RECAPTURE GOLLUM WE CAME ON HIS TRAIL AMONG THOSE OF MANY ORCS AND IT PLUNGED DEEP INTO THE FOREST GOING SOUTH BUT ERE LONG IT ESCAPED OUR SKILL AND WE DARED NOT CONTINUE THE HUNT FOR WE WERE DRAWING NIGH TO DOL GULDUR AND THAT IS STILL A VERY EVIL PLACE WE DO NOT GO THAT WAY
WELL WELL HE IS GONE SAID GANDALF WE HAVE NO TIME TO SEEK FOR HIM AGAIN HE MUST DO WHAT HE WILL BUT HE MAY PLAY A PART YET THAT NEITHER HE NOR SAURON HAVE FORESEEN
AND NOW I WILL ANSWER GALDORS OTHER QUESTIONS WHAT OF SARUMAN WHAT ARE HIS COUNSELS TO US IN THIS NEED THIS TALE I MUST TELL IN FULL FOR ONLY ELROND HAS HEARD IT YET AND THAT IN BRIEF BUT IT WILL BEAR ON ALL THAT WE MUST RESOLVE IT IS THE LAST CHAPTER IN THE TALE OF THE RING SO FAR AS IT HAS YET GONE
AT THE END OF JUNE I WAS IN THE SHIRE BUT A CLOUD OF ANXIETY WAS ON MY MIND AND I RODE TO THE SOUTHERN BORDERS OF THE LITTLE LAND FOR I HAD A FOREBODING OF SOME DANGER STILL HIDDEN FROM ME BUT DRAWING NEAR THERE MESSAGES REACHED ME TELLING ME OF WAR AND DEFEAT IN GONDOR AND WHEN I HEARD OF THE BLACK SHADOW A CHILL SMOTE MY HEART BUT I FOUND NOTHING SAVE A FEW FUGITIVES FROM THE SOUTH YET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ON THEM SAT A FEAR OF WHICH THEY WOULD NOT SPEAK I TURNED THEN EAST AND NORTH AND JOURNEYED ALONG THE GREENWAY AND NOT FAR FROM BREE I CAME UPON A TRAVELLER SITTING ON A BANK BESIDE THE ROAD WITH HIS GRAZING HORSE BESIDE HIM IT WAS RADAGAST THE BROWN WHO AT ONE TIME DWELT AT RHOSGOBEL NEAR THE BORDERS OF MIRKWOOD HE IS ONE OF MY ORDER BUT I HAD NOT SEEN HIM FOR MANY A YEAR
GANDALF HE CRIED I WAS SEEKING YOU BUT I AM A STRANGER IN THESE PARTS ALL I KNEW WAS THAT YOU MIGHT BE FOUND IN A WILD REGION WITH THE UNCOUTH NAME OF SHIRE
YOUR INFORMATION WAS CORRECT I SAID BUT DO NOT PUT IT THAT WAY IF YOU MEET ANY OF THE INHABITANTS YOU ARE NEAR THE BORDERS OF THE SHIRE NOW AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME IT MUST BE PRESSING YOU WERE NEVER A TRAVELLER UNLESS DRIVEN BY GREAT NEED
I HAVE AN URGENT ERRAND HE SAID MY NEWS IS EVIL THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS IF THE HEDGES MIGHT HAVE EARS NAZGUL HE WHISPERED THE NINE ARE ABROAD AGAIN THEY HAVE CROSSED THE RIVER SECRETLY AND ARE MOVING WESTWARD THEY HAVE TAKEN THE GUISE OF RIDERS IN BLACK
I KNEW THEN WHAT I HAD DREADED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
THE ENEMY MUST HAVE SOME GREAT NEED OR PURPOSE SAID RADAGAST BUT WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES HIM LOOK TO THESE DISTANT AND DESOLATE PARTS I CANNOT GUESS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID I
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WHEREVER THEY GO THE RIDERS ASK FOR NEWS OF A LAND CALLED SHIRE
THE SHIRE I SAID BUT MY HEART SANK FOR EVEN THE WISE MIGHT FEAR TO WITHSTAND THE NINE WHEN THEY ARE GATHERED TOGETHER UNDER THEIR FELL CHIEFTAIN A GREAT KING AND SORCERER HE WAS OF OLD AND NOW HE WIELDS A DEADLY FEAR WHO TOLD YOU AND WHO SENT YOU I ASKED
SARUMAN THE WHITE ANSWERED RADAGAST AND HE TOLD ME TO SAY THAT IF YOU FEEL THE NEED HE WILL HELP BUT YOU MUST SEEK HIS AID AT ONCE OR IT WILL BE TOO LATE
AND THAT MESSAGE BROUGHT ME HOPE FOR SARUMAN THE WHITE IS THE GREATEST OF MY ORDER RADAGAST IS OF COURSE A WORTHY WIZARD A MASTER OF SHAPES AND CHANGES OF HUE AND HE HAS MUCH LORE OF HERBS AND BEASTS AND BIRDS ARE ESPECIALLY HIS FRIENDS BUT SARUMAN HAS LONG STUDIED THE ARTS OF THE ENEMY HIMSELF AND THUS WE HAVE OFTEN BEEN ABLE TO FORESTALL HIM IT WAS BY THE DEVICES OF SARUMAN THAT WE DROVE HIM FROM DOL GULDUR IT MIGHT BE THAT HE HAD FOUND SOME WEAPONS THAT WOULD DRIVE BACK THE NINE
I WILL GO TO SARUMAN I SAID
THEN YOU MUST GO NOW SAID RADAGAST FOR I HAVE WASTED TIME IN LOOKING FOR YOU AND THE DAYS ARE RUNNING SHORT I WAS TOLD TO FIND YOU BEFORE MIDSUMMER AND THAT IS NOW HERE EVEN IF YOU SET OUT FROM THIS SPOT YOU WILL HARDLY REACH HIM BEFORE THE NINE DISCOVER THE LAND THAT THEY SEEK I MYSELF SHALL TURN BACK AT ONCE AND WITH THAT HE MOUNTED AND WOULD HAVE RIDDEN STRAIGHT OFF
STAY A MOMENT I SAID WE SHALL NEED YOUR HELP AND THE HELP OF ALL THINGS THAT WILL GIVE IT SEND OUT MESSAGES TO ALL THE BEASTS AND BIRDS THAT ARE YOUR FRIENDS TELL THEM TO BRING NEWS OF ANYTHING THAT BEARS ON THIS MATTER TO SARUMAN AND GANDALF LET MESSAGES BE SENT TO ORTHANC
I WILL DO THAT HE SAID AND RODE OFF AS IF THE NINE WERE AFTER HIM
I COULD NOT FOLLOW HIM THEN AND THERE I HAD RIDDEN VERY FAR ALREADY THAT DAY AND I WAS AS WEARY AS MY HORSE AND I NEEDED TO CONSIDER MATTERS I STAYED THE NIGHT IN BREE AND DECIDED THAT I HAD NO TIME TO RETURN TO THE SHIRE NEVER DID I MAKE A GREATER MISTAKE
HOWEVER I WROTE A MESSAGE TO FRODO AND TRUSTED TO MY FRIEND THE INNKEEPER TO SEND IT TO HIM I RODE AWAY AT DAWN AND I CAME AT LONG LAST TO THE DWELLING OF SARUMAN THAT IS FAR SOUTH IN ISENGARD IN THE END OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS NOT FAR FROM THE GAP OF ROHAN AND BOROMIR WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT IS A GREAT OPEN VALE THAT LIES BETWEEN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND THE NORTHMOST FOOTHILLS OF ERED NIMRAIS THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OF HIS HOME BUT ISENGARD IS A CIRCLE OF SHEER ROCKS THAT ENCLOSE A VALLEY AS WITH A WALL AND IN THE MIDST OF THAT VALLEY IS A TOWER OF STONE CALLED ORTHANC IT WAS NOT MADE BY SARUMAN BUT BY THE MEN OF NUMENOR LONG AGO AND IT IS VERY TALL AND HAS MANY SECRETS YET IT LOOKS NOT TO BE A WORK OF CRAFT IT CANNOT BE REACHED SAVE BY PASSING THE CIRCLE OF ISENGARD AND IN THAT CIRCLE THERE IS ONLY ONE GATE
LATE ONE EVENING I CAME TO THE GATE LIKE A GREAT ARCH IN THE WALL OF ROCK AND IT WAS STRONGLY GUARDED BUT THE KEEPERS OF THE GATE WERE ON THE WATCH FOR ME AND TOLD ME THAT SARUMAN AWAITED ME I RODE UNDER THE ARCH AND THE GATE CLOSED SILENTLY BEHIND ME AND SUDDENLY I WAS AFRAID THOUGH I KNEW NO REASON FOR IT
BUT I RODE TO THE FOOT OF ORTHANC AND CAME TO THE STAIR OF SARUMAN AND THERE HE MET ME AND LED ME UP TO HIS HIGH CHAMBER HE WORE A RING ON HIS FINGER
SO YOU HAVE COME GANDALF HE SAID TO ME GRAVELY BUT IN HIS EYES THERE SEEMED TO BE A WHITE LIGHT AS IF A COLD LAUGHTER WAS IN HIS HEART
YES I HAVE COME I SAID I HAVE COME FOR YOUR AID SARUMAN THE WHITE AND THAT TITLE SEEMED TO ANGER HIM
HAVE YOU INDEED GANDALF THE GREY HE SCOFFED FOR AID IT HAS SELDOM BEEN HEARD OF THAT GANDALF THE GREY SOUGHT FOR AID ONE SO CUNNING AND SO WISE WANDERING ABOUT THE LANDS AND CONCERNING HIMSELF IN EVERY BUSINESS WHETHER IT BELONGS TO HIM OR NOT
I LOOKED AT HIM AND WONDERED BUT IF I AM NOT DECEIVED SAID I THINGS ARE NOW MOVING WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE UNION OF ALL OUR STRENGTH
THAT MAY BE SO HE SAID BUT THE THOUGHT IS LATE IN COMING TO YOU HOW LONG I WONDER HAVE YOU CONCEALED FROM ME THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL A MATTER OF GREATEST IMPORT WHAT BRINGS YOU NOW FROM YOUR LURKINGPLACE IN THE SHIRE
THE NINE HAVE COME FORTH AGAIN I ANSWERED THEY HAVE CROSSED THE RIVER SO RADAGAST SAID TO ME
RADAGAST THE BROWN LAUGHED SARUMAN AND HE NO LONGER CONCEALED HIS SCORN RADAGAST THE BIRDTAMER RADAGAST THE SIMPLE RADAGAST THE FOOL YET HE HAD JUST THE WIT TO PLAY THE PART THAT I SET HIM FOR YOU HAVE COME AND THAT WAS ALL THE PURPOSE OF MY MESSAGE AND HERE YOU WILL STAY GANDALF THE GREY AND REST FROM JOURNEYS FOR I AM SARUMAN THE WISE SARUMAN RINGMAKER SARUMAN OF MANY COLOURS
I LOOKED THEN AND SAW THAT HIS ROBES WHICH HAD SEEMED WHITE WERE NOT SO BUT WERE WOVEN OF ALL COLOURS AND IF HE MOVED THEY SHIMMERED AND CHANGED HUE SO THAT THE EYE WAS BEWILDERED
I LIKED WHITE BETTER I SAID
WHITE HE SNEERED IT SERVES AS A BEGINNING WHITE CLOTH MAY BE DYED THE WHITE PAGE CAN BE OVERWRITTEN AND THE WHITE LIGHT CAN BE BROKEN
IN WHICH CASE IT IS NO LONGER WHITE SAID I AND HE THAT BREAKS A THING TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS HAS LEFT THE PATH OF WISDOM
YOU NEED NOT SPEAK TO ME AS TO ONE OF THE FOOLS THAT YOU TAKE FOR FRIENDS SAID HE I HAVE NOT BROUGHT YOU HITHER TO BE INSTRUCTED BY YOU BUT TO GIVE YOU A CHOICE
HE DREW HIMSELF UP THEN AND BEGAN TO DECLAIM AS IF HE WERE MAKING A SPEECH LONG REHEARSED THE ELDER DAYS ARE GONE THE MIDDLE DAYS ARE PASSING THE YOUNGER DAYS ARE BEGINNING THE TIME OF THE ELVES IS OVER BUT OUR TIME IS AT HAND THE WORLD OF MEN WHICH WE MUST RULE BUT WE MUST HAVE POWER POWER TO ORDER ALL THINGS AS WE WILL FOR THAT GOOD WHICH ONLY THE WISE CAN SEE
AND LISTEN GANDALF MY OLD FRIEND AND HELPER HE SAID COMING NEAR AND SPEAKING NOW IN A SOFTER VOICE I SAID WE FOR WE IT MAY BE IF YOU WILL JOIN WITH ME A NEW POWER IS RISING AGAINST IT THE OLD ALLIES AND POLICIES WILL NOT AVAIL US AT ALL THERE IS NO HOPE LEFT IN ELVES OR DYING NUMENOR THIS THEN IS ONE CHOICE BEFORE YOU BEFORE US WE MAY JOIN WITH THAT POWER IT WOULD BE WISE GANDALF THERE IS HOPE THAT WAY ITS VICTORY IS AT HAND AND THERE WILL BE RICH REWARD FOR THOSE THAT AIDED IT AS THE POWER GROWS ITS PROVED FRIENDS WILL ALSO GROW AND THE WISE SUCH AS YOU AND I MAY WITH PATIENCE COME AT LAST TO DIRECT ITS COURSES TO CONTROL IT WE CAN BIDE OUR TIME WE CAN KEEP OUR THOUGHTS IN OUR HEARTS DEPLORING MAYBE EVILS DONE BY THE WAY BUT APPROVING THE HIGH AND ULTIMATE PURPOSE KNOWLEDGE RULE ORDER ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SO FAR STRIVEN IN VAIN TO ACCOMPLISH HINDERED RATHER THAN HELPED BY OUR WEAK OR IDLE FRIENDS THERE NEED NOT BE THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY REAL CHANGE IN OUR DESIGNS ONLY IN OUR MEANS
SARUMAN I SAID I HAVE HEARD SPEECHES OF THIS KIND BEFORE BUT ONLY IN THE MOUTHS OF EMISSARIES SENT FROM MORDOR TO DECEIVE THE IGNORANT I CANNOT THINK THAT YOU BROUGHT ME SO FAR ONLY TO WEARY MY EARS
HE LOOKED AT ME SIDELONG AND PAUSED A WHILE CONSIDERING WELL I SEE THAT THIS WISE COURSE DOES NOT COMMEND ITSELF TO YOU HE SAID NOT YET NOT IF SOME BETTER WAY CAN BE CONTRIVED
HE CAME AND LAID HIS LONG HAND ON MY ARM AND WHY NOT GANDALF HE WHISPERED WHY NOT THE RULING RING IF WE COULD COMMAND THAT THEN THE POWER WOULD PASS TO US THAT IS IN TRUTH WHY I BROUGHT YOU HERE FOR I HAVE MANY EYES IN MY SERVICE AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THIS PRECIOUS THING NOW LIES IS IT NOT SO OR WHY DO THE NINE ASK FOR THE SHIRE AND WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS THERE AS HE SAID THIS A LUST WHICH HE COULD NOT CONCEAL SHONE SUDDENLY IN HIS EYES
SARUMAN I SAID STANDING AWAY FROM HIM ONLY ONE HAND AT A TIME CAN WIELD THE ONE AND YOU KNOW THAT WELL SO DO NOT TROUBLE TO SAY WE BUT I WOULD NOT GIVE IT NAY I WOULD NOT GIVE EVEN NEWS OF IT TO YOU NOW THAT I LEARN YOUR MIND YOU WERE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL BUT YOU HAVE UNMASKED YOURSELF AT LAST WELL THE CHOICES ARE IT SEEMS TO SUBMIT TO SAURON OR TO YOURSELF I WILL TAKE NEITHER HAVE YOU OTHERS TO OFFER
HE WAS COLD NOW AND PERILOUS YES HE SAID I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TO SHOW WISDOM EVEN IN YOUR OWN BEHALF BUT I GAVE YOU THE CHANCE OF AIDING ME WILLINGLY AND SO SAVING YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE AND PAIN THE THIRD CHOICE IS TO STAY HERE UNTIL THE END
UNTIL WHAT END
UNTIL YOU REVEAL TO ME WHERE THE ONE MAY BE FOUND I MAY FIND MEANS TO PERSUADE YOU OR UNTIL IT IS FOUND IN YOUR DESPITE AND THE RULER HAS TIME TO TURN TO LIGHTER MATTERS TO DEVISE SAY A FITTING REWARD FOR THE HINDRANCE AND INSOLENCE OF GANDALF THE GREY
THAT MAY NOT PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE LIGHTER MATTERS SAID I HE LAUGHED AT ME FOR MY WORDS WERE EMPTY AND HE KNEW IT
THEY TOOK ME AND THEY SET ME ALONE ON THE PINNACLE OF ORTHANC IN THE PLACE WHERE SARUMAN WAS ACCUSTOMED TO WATCH THE STARS THERE IS NO DESCENT SAVE BY A NARROW STAIR OF MANY THOUSAND STEPS AND THE VALLEY BELOW SEEMS FAR AWAY I LOOKED ON IT AND SAW THAT WHEREAS IT HAD ONCE BEEN GREEN AND FAIR IT WAS NOW FILLED WITH PITS AND FORGES WOLVES AND ORCS WERE HOUSED IN ISENGARD FOR SARUMAN WAS MUSTERING A GREAT FORCE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IN RIVALRY OF SAURON AND NOT IN HIS SERVICE YET OVER ALL HIS WORKS A DARK SMOKE HUNG AND WRAPPED ITSELF ABOUT THE SIDES OF ORTHANC I STOOD ALONE ON AN ISLAND IN THE CLOUDS AND I HAD NO CHANCE OF ESCAPE AND MY DAYS WERE BITTER I WAS PIERCED WITH COLD AND I HAD BUT LITTLE ROOM IN WHICH TO PACE TO AND FRO BROODING ON THE COMING OF THE RIDERS TO THE NORTH
THAT THE NINE HAD INDEED ARISEN I FELT ASSURED APART FROM THE WORDS OF SARUMAN WHICH MIGHT BE LIES LONG ERE I CAME TO ISENGARD I HAD HEARD TIDINGS BY THE WAY THAT COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FEAR WAS EVER IN MY HEART FOR MY FRIENDS IN THE SHIRE BUT STILL I HAD SOME HOPE I HOPED THAT FRODO HAD SET FORTH AT ONCE AS MY LETTER HAD URGED AND THAT HE HAD REACHED RIVENDELL BEFORE THE DEADLY PURSUIT BEGAN AND BOTH MY FEAR AND MY HOPE PROVED ILLFOUNDED FOR MY HOPE WAS FOUNDED ON A FAT MAN IN BREE AND MY FEAR WAS FOUNDED ON THE CUNNING OF SAURON BUT FAT MEN WHO SELL ALE HAVE MANY CALLS TO ANSWER AND THE POWER OF SAURON IS STILL LESS THAN FEAR MAKES IT BUT IN THE CIRCLE OF ISENGARD TRAPPED AND ALONE IT WAS NOT EASY TO THINK THAT THE HUNTERS BEFORE WHOM ALL HAVE FLED OR FALLEN WOULD FALTER IN THE SHIRE FAR AWAY
I SAW YOU CRIED FRODO YOU WERE WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THE MOON SHONE IN YOUR HAIR
GANDALF PAUSED ASTONISHED AND LOOKED AT HIM IT WAS ONLY A DREAM SAID FRODO BUT IT SUDDENLY CAME BACK TO ME I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN IT IT CAME SOME TIME AGO AFTER I LEFT THE SHIRE I THINK
THEN IT WAS LATE IN COMING SAID GANDALF AS YOU WILL SEE I WAS IN AN EVIL PLIGHT AND THOSE WHO KNOW ME WILL AGREE THAT I HAVE SELDOM BEEN IN SUCH NEED AND DO NOT BEAR SUCH MISFORTUNE WELL GANDALF THE GREY CAUGHT LIKE A FLY IN A SPIDERS TREACHEROUS WEB YET EVEN THE MOST SUBTLE SPIDERS MAY LEAVE A WEAK THREAD
AT FIRST I FEARED AS SARUMAN NO DOUBT INTENDED THAT RADAGAST HAD ALSO FALLEN YET I HAD CAUGHT NO HINT OF ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS VOICE OR IN HIS EYE AT OUR MEETING IF I HAD I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO ISENGARD OR I SHOULD HAVE GONE MORE WARILY SO SARUMAN GUESSED AND HE HAD CONCEALED HIS MIND AND DECEIVED HIS MESSENGER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS IN ANY CASE TO TRY AND WIN OVER THE HONEST RADAGAST TO TREACHERY HE SOUGHT ME IN GOOD FAITH AND SO PERSUADED ME
THAT WAS THE UNDOING OF SARUMANS PLOT FOR RADAGAST KNEW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT DO AS I ASKED AND HE RODE AWAY TOWARDS MIRKWOOD WHERE HE HAD MANY FRIENDS OF OLD AND THE EAGLES OF THE MOUNTAINS WENT FAR AND WIDE AND THEY SAW MANY THINGS THE GATHERING OF WOLVES AND THE MUSTERING OF ORCS AND THE NINE RIDERS GOING HITHER AND THITHER IN THE LANDS AND THEY HEARD NEWS OF THE ESCAPE OF GOLLUM AND THEY SENT A MESSENGER TO BRING THESE TIDINGS TO ME
SO IT WAS THAT WHEN SUMMER WANED THERE CAME A NIGHT OF MOON AND GWAIHIR THE WINDLORD SWIFTEST OF THE GREAT EAGLES CAME UNLOOKEDFOR TO ORTHANC AND HE FOUND ME STANDING ON THE PINNACLE THEN I SPOKE TO HIM AND HE BORE ME AWAY BEFORE SARUMAN WAS AWARE I WAS FAR FROM ISENGARD ERE THE WOLVES AND ORCS ISSUED FROM THE GATE TO PURSUE ME
HOW FAR CAN YOU BEAR ME I SAID TO GWAIHIR
MANY LEAGUES SAID HE BUT NOT TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH I WAS SENT TO BEAR TIDINGS NOT BURDENS
THEN I MUST HAVE A STEED ON LAND I SAID AND A STEED SURPASSINGLY SWIFT FOR I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH NEED OF HASTE BEFORE
THEN I WILL BEAR YOU TO EDORAS WHERE THE LORD OF ROHAN SITS IN HIS HALLS HE SAID FOR THAT IS NOT VERY FAR OFF AND I WAS GLAD FOR IN THE RIDDERMARK OF ROHAN THE ROHIRRIM THE HORSELORDS DWELL AND THERE ARE NO HORSES LIKE THOSE THAT ARE BRED IN THAT GREAT VALE BETWEEN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND THE WHITE
ARE THE MEN OF ROHAN STILL TO BE TRUSTED DO YOU THINK  I SAID TO GWAIHIR FOR THE TREASON OF SARUMAN HAD SHAKEN MY FAITH
THEY PAY A TRIBUTE OF HORSES HE ANSWERED AND SEND MANY YEARLY TO MORDOR OR SO IT IS SAID BUT THEY ARE NOT YET UNDER THE YOKE BUT IF SARUMAN HAS BECOME EVIL AS YOU SAY THEN THEIR DOOM CANNOT BE LONG DELAYED
HE SET ME DOWN IN THE LAND OF ROHAN ERE DAWN AND NOW I HAVE LENGTHENED MY TALE OVER LONG THE REST MUST BE MORE BRIEF IN ROHAN I FOUND EVIL ALREADY AT WORK THE LIES OF SARUMAN AND THE KING OF THE LAND WOULD NOT LISTEN TO MY WARNINGS HE BADE ME TAKE A HORSE AND BE GONE AND I CHOSE ONE MUCH TO MY LIKING BUT LITTLE TO HIS I TOOK THE BEST HORSE IN HIS LAND AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LIKE OF HIM
THEN HE MUST BE A NOBLE BEAST INDEED SAID ARAGORN AND IT GRIEVES ME MORE THAN MANY TIDINGS THAT MIGHT SEEM WORSE TO LEARN THAT SAURON LEVIES SUCH TRIBUTE IT WAS NOT SO WHEN LAST I WAS IN THAT LAND
NOR IS IT NOW I WILL SWEAR SAID BOROMIR IT IS A LIE THAT COMES FROM THE ENEMY I KNOW THE MEN OF ROHAN TRUE AND VALIANT OUR ALLIES DWELLING STILL IN THE LANDS THAT WE GAVE THEM LONG AGO
THE SHADOW OF MORDOR LIES ON DISTANT LANDS ANSWERED ARAGORN SARUMAN HAS FALLEN UNDER IT ROHAN IS BESET WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL FIND THERE IF EVER YOU RETURN
NOT THIS AT LEAST SAID BOROMIR THAT THEY WILL BUY THEIR LIVES WITH HORSES THEY LOVE THEIR HORSES NEXT TO THEIR KIN AND NOT WITHOUT REASON FOR THE HORSES OF THE RIDDERMARK COME FROM THE FIELDS OF THE NORTH FAR FROM THE SHADOW AND THEIR RACE AS THAT OF THEIR MASTERS IS DESCENDED FROM THE FREE DAYS OF OLD
TRUE INDEED SAID GANDALF AND THERE IS ONE AMONG THEM THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOALED IN THE MORNING OF THE WORLD THE HORSES OF THE NINE CANNOT VIE WITH HIM TIRELESS SWIFT AS THE FLOWING WIND SHADOWFAX THEY CALLED HIM BY DAY HIS COAT GLISTENS LIKE SILVER AND BY NIGHT IT IS LIKE A SHADE AND HE PASSES UNSEEN LIGHT IS HIS FOOTFALL NEVER BEFORE HAD ANY MAN MOUNTED HIM BUT I TOOK HIM AND I TAMED HIM AND SO SPEEDILY HE BORE ME THAT I REACHED THE SHIRE WHEN FRODO WAS ON THE BARROWDOWNS THOUGH I SET OUT FROM ROHAN ONLY WHEN HE SET OUT FROM HOBBITON
BUT FEAR GREW IN ME AS I RODE EVER AS I CAME NORTH I HEARD TIDINGS OF THE RIDERS AND THOUGH I GAINED ON THEM DAY BY DAY THEY WERE EVER BEFORE ME THEY HAD DIVIDED THEIR FORCES I LEARNED SOME REMAINED ON THE EASTERN BORDERS NOT FAR FROM THE GREENWAY AND SOME INVADED THE SHIRE FROM THE SOUTH I CAME TO HOBBITON AND FRODO HAD GONE BUT I HAD WORDS WITH OLD GAMGEE MANY WORDS AND FEW TO THE POINT HE HAD MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE NEW OWNERS OF BAG END
I CANT ABIDE CHANGES SAID HE NOT AT MY TIME OF LIFE AND LEAST OF ALL CHANGES FOR THE WORST CHANGES FOR THE WORST HE REPEATED MANY TIMES
WORST IS A BAD WORD I SAID TO HIM AND I HOPE YOU DO NOT LIVE TO SEE IT BUT AMIDST HIS TALK I GATHERED AT LAST THAT FRODO HAD LEFT HOBBITON LESS THAN A WEEK BEFORE AND THAT A BLACK HORSEMAN HAD COME TO THE HILL THE SAME EVENING THEN I RODE ON IN FEAR I CAME TO BUCKLAND AND FOUND IT IN UPROAR AS BUSY AS A HIVE OF ANTS THAT HAS BEEN STIRRED WITH A STICK I CAME TO THE HOUSE AT CRICKHOLLOW AND IT WAS BROKEN OPEN AND EMPTY BUT ON THE THRESHOLD THERE LAY A CLOAK THAT HAD BEEN FRODOS THEN FOR A WHILE HOPE LEFT ME AND I DID NOT WAIT TO GATHER NEWS OR I MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMFORTED BUT I RODE ON THE TRAIL OF THE RIDERS IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW FOR IT WENT MANY WAYS AND I WAS AT A LOSS BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ONE OR TWO HAD RIDDEN TOWARDS BREE AND THAT WAY I WENT FOR I THOUGHT OF WORDS THAT MIGHT BE SAID TO THE INNKEEPER
BUTTERBUR THEY CALL HIM THOUGHT I IF THIS DELAY WAS HIS FAULT I WILL MELT ALL THE BUTTER IN HIM I WILL ROAST THE OLD FOOL OVER A SLOW FIRE HE EXPECTED NO LESS AND WHEN HE SAW MY FACE HE FELL DOWN FLAT AND BEGAN TO MELT ON THE SPOT
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM CRIED FRODO IN ALARM HE WAS REALLY VERY KIND TO US AND DID ALL THAT HE COULD
GANDALF LAUGHED DONT BE AFRAID HE SAID I DID NOT BITE AND I BARKED VERY LITTLE SO OVERJOYED WAS I BY THE NEWS THAT I GOT OUT OF HIM WHEN HE STOPPED QUAKING THAT I EMBRACED THE OLD FELLOW HOW IT HAPPENED I COULD NOT THEN GUESS BUT I LEARNED THAT YOU HAD BEEN IN BREE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAD GONE OFF THAT MORNING WITH STRIDER
STRIDER I CRIED SHOUTING FOR JOY
YES SIR I AM AFRAID SO SIR SAID BUTTERBUR MISTAKING ME HE GOT AT THEM IN SPITE OF ALL THAT I COULD DO AND THEY TOOK UP WITH HIM THEY BEHAVED VERY QUEER ALL THE TIME THEY WERE HERE WILFUL YOU MIGHT SAY
ASS FOOL THRICE WORTHY AND BELOVED BARLIMAN SAID I ITS THE BEST NEWS I HAVE HAD SINCE MIDSUMMER ITS WORTH A GOLD PIECE AT THE LEAST MAY YOUR BEER BE LAID UNDER AN ENCHANTMENT OF SURPASSING EXCELLENCE FOR SEVEN YEARS SAID I NOW I CAN TAKE A NIGHTS REST THE FIRST SINCE I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHEN
SO I STAYED THERE THAT NIGHT WONDERING MUCH WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE RIDERS FOR ONLY OF TWO HAD THERE YET BEEN ANY NEWS IN BREE IT SEEMED BUT IN THE NIGHT WE HEARD MORE FIVE AT LEAST CAME FROM THE WEST AND THEY THREW DOWN THE GATES AND PASSED THROUGH BREE LIKE A HOWLING WIND AND THE BREEFOLK ARE STILL SHIVERING AND EXPECTING THE END OF THE WORLD I GOT UP BEFORE DAWN AND WENT AFTER THEM
I DO NOT KNOW BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED THEIR CAPTAIN REMAINED IN SECRET AWAY SOUTH OF BREE WHILE TWO RODE AHEAD THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND FOUR MORE INVADED THE SHIRE BUT WHEN THESE WERE FOILED IN BREE AND AT CRICKHOLLOW THEY RETURNED TO THEIR CAPTAIN WITH TIDINGS AND SO LEFT THE ROAD UNGUARDED FOR A WHILE EXCEPT BY THEIR SPIES THE CAPTAIN THEN SENT SOME EASTWARD STRAIGHT ACROSS COUNTRY AND HE HIMSELF WITH THE REST RODE ALONG THE ROAD IN GREAT WRATH
I GALLOPED TO WEATHERTOP LIKE A GALE AND I REACHED IT BEFORE SUNDOWN ON MY SECOND DAY FROM BREE  AND THEY WERE THERE BEFORE ME THEY DREW AWAY FROM ME FOR THEY FELT THE COMING OF MY ANGER AND THEY DARED NOT FACE IT WHILE THE SUN WAS IN THE SKY BUT THEY CLOSED ROUND AT NIGHT AND I WAS BESIEGED ON THE HILLTOP IN THE OLD RING OF AMON SUL I WAS HARD PUT TO IT INDEED SUCH LIGHT AND FLAME CANNOT HAVE BEEN SEEN ON WEATHERTOP SINCE THE WARBEACONS OF OLD
AT SUNRISE I ESCAPED AND FLED TOWARDS THE NORTH I COULD NOT HOPE TO DO MORE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND YOU FRODO IN THE WILDERNESS AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOLLY TO TRY WITH ALL THE NINE AT MY HEELS SO I HAD TO TRUST TO ARAGORN BUT I HOPED TO DRAW SOME OF THEM OFF AND YET REACH RIVENDELL AHEAD OF YOU AND SEND OUT HELP FOUR RIDERS DID INDEED FOLLOW ME BUT THEY TURNED BACK AFTER A WHILE AND MADE FOR THE FORD IT SEEMS THAT HELPED A LITTLE FOR THERE WERE ONLY FIVE NOT NINE WHEN YOUR CAMP WAS ATTACKED
I REACHED HERE AT LAST BY A LONG HARD ROAD UP THE HOARWELL AND THROUGH THE ETTENMOORS AND DOWN FROM THE NORTH IT TOOK ME NEARLY FOURTEEN DAYS FROM WEATHERTOP FOR I COULD NOT RIDE AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE TROLLFELLS AND SHADOWFAX DEPARTED I SENT HIM BACK TO HIS MASTER BUT A GREAT FRIENDSHIP HAS GROWN BETWEEN US AND IF I HAVE NEED HE WILL COME AT MY CALL BUT SO IT WAS THAT I CAME TO RIVENDELL ONLY THREE DAYS BEFORE THE RING AND NEWS OF ITS PERIL HAD ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT HERE  WHICH PROVED WELL INDEED
AND THAT FRODO IS THE END OF MY ACCOUNT MAY ELROND AND THE OTHERS FORGIVE THE LENGTH OF IT BUT SUCH A THING HAS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT GANDALF BROKE TRYST AND DID NOT COME WHEN HE PROMISED AN ACCOUNT TO THE RINGBEARER OF SO STRANGE AN EVENT WAS REQUIRED I THINK
WELL THE TALE IS NOW TOLD FROM FIRST TO LAST HERE WE ALL ARE AND HERE IS THE RING BUT WE HAVE NOT YET COME ANY NEARER TO OUR PURPOSE WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH IT
THERE WAS SILENCE AT LAST ELROND SPOKE AGAIN
THIS IS GRIEVOUS NEWS CONCERNING SARUMAN HE SAID FOR WE TRUSTED HIM AND HE IS DEEP IN ALL OUR COUNSELS IT IS PERILOUS TO STUDY TOO DEEPLY THE ARTS OF THE ENEMY FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL BUT SUCH FALLS AND BETRAYALS ALAS HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE OF THE TALES THAT WE HAVE HEARD THIS DAY THE TALE OF FRODO WAS MOST STRANGE TO ME I HAVE KNOWN FEW HOBBITS SAVE BILBO HERE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE IS PERHAPS NOT SO ALONE AND SINGULAR AS I HAD THOUGHT HIM THE WORLD HAS CHANGED MUCH SINCE I LAST WAS ON THE WESTWARD ROADS
THE BARROWWIGHTS WE KNOW BY MANY NAMES AND OF THE OLD FOREST MANY TALES HAVE BEEN TOLD ALL THAT NOW REMAINS IS BUT AN OUTLIER OF ITS NORTHERN MARCH TIME WAS WHEN A SQUIRREL COULD GO FROM TREE TO TREE FROM WHAT IS NOW THE SHIRE TO DUNLAND WEST OF ISENGARD IN THOSE LANDS I JOURNEYED ONCE AND MANY THINGS WILD AND STRANGE I KNEW BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN BOMBADIL IF INDEED THIS IS STILL THE SAME THAT WALKED THE WOODS AND HILLS LONG AGO AND EVEN THEN WAS OLDER THAN THE OLD THAT WAS NOT THEN HIS NAME IARWAIN BENADAR WE CALLED HIM OLDEST AND FATHERLESS BUT MANY ANOTHER NAME HE HAS SINCE BEEN GIVEN BY OTHER FOLK FORN BY THE DWARVES ORALD BY NORTHERN MEN AND OTHER NAMES BESIDE HE IS A STRANGE CREATURE BUT MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE SUMMONED HIM TO OUR COUNCIL
HE WOULD NOT HAVE COME SAID GANDALF
COULD WE NOT STILL SEND MESSAGES TO HIM AND OBTAIN HIS HELP ASKED ERESTOR IT SEEMS THAT HE HAS A POWER EVEN OVER THE RING
NO I SHOULD NOT PUT IT SO SAID GANDALF SAY RATHER THAT THE RING HAS NO POWER OVER HIM HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT HE CANNOT ALTER THE RING ITSELF NOR BREAK ITS POWER OVER OTHERS AND NOW HE IS WITHDRAWN INTO A LITTLE LAND WITHIN BOUNDS THAT HE HAS SET THOUGH NONE CAN SEE THEM WAITING PERHAPS FOR A CHANGE OF DAYS AND HE WILL NOT STEP BEYOND THEM
BUT WITHIN THOSE BOUNDS NOTHING SEEMS TO DISMAY HIM SAID ERESTOR WOULD HE NOT TAKE THE RING AND KEEP IT THERE FOR EVER HARMLESS
NO SAID GANDALF NOT WILLINGLY HE MIGHT DO SO IF ALL THE FREE FOLK OF THE WORLD BEGGED HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE NEED AND IF HE WERE GIVEN THE RING HE WOULD SOON FORGET IT OR MOST LIKELY THROW IT AWAY SUCH THINGS HAVE NO HOLD ON HIS MIND HE WOULD BE A MOST UNSAFE GUARDIAN AND THAT ALONE IS ANSWER ENOUGH
BUT IN ANY CASE SAID GLORFINDEL TO SEND THE RING TO HIM WOULD ONLY POSTPONE THE DAY OF EVIL HE IS FAR AWAY WE COULD NOT NOW TAKE IT BACK TO HIM UNGUESSED UNMARKED BY ANY SPY AND EVEN IF WE COULD SOON OR LATE THE LORD OF THE RINGS WOULD LEARN OF ITS HIDING PLACE AND WOULD BEND ALL HIS POWER TOWARDS IT COULD THAT POWER BE DEFIED BY BOMBADIL ALONE I THINK NOT I THINK THAT IN THE END IF ALL ELSE IS CONQUERED BOMBADIL WILL FALL LAST AS HE WAS FIRST AND THEN NIGHT WILL COME
I KNOW LITTLE OF IARWAIN SAVE THE NAME SAID GALDOR BUT GLORFINDEL I THINK IS RIGHT POWER TO DEFY OUR ENEMY IS NOT IN HIM UNLESS SUCH POWER IS IN THE EARTH ITSELF AND YET WE SEE THAT SAURON CAN TORTURE AND DESTROY THE VERY HILLS WHAT POWER STILL REMAINS LIES WITH US HERE IN IMLADRIS OR WITH CIRDAN AT THE HAVENS OR IN LORIEN BUT HAVE THEY THE STRENGTH HAVE WE HERE THE STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND THE ENEMY THE COMING OF SAURON AT THE LAST WHEN ALL ELSE IS OVERTHROWN
I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH SAID ELROND NEITHER HAVE THEY
THEN IF THE RING CANNOT BE KEPT FROM HIM FOR EVER BY STRENGTH SAID GLORFINDEL TWO THINGS ONLY REMAIN FOR US TO ATTEMPT TO SEND IT OVER THE SEA OR TO DESTROY IT
BUT GANDALF HAS REVEALED TO US THAT WE CANNOT DESTROY IT BY ANY CRAFT THAT WE HERE POSSESS SAID ELROND AND THEY WHO DWELL BEYOND THE SEA WOULD NOT RECEIVE IT FOR GOOD OR ILL IT BELONGS TO MIDDLEEARTH IT IS FOR US WHO STILL DWELL HERE TO DEAL WITH IT
THEN SAID GLORFINDEL LET US CAST IT INTO THE DEEPS AND SO MAKE THE LIES OF SARUMAN COME TRUE FOR IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT EVEN AT THE COUNCIL HIS FEET WERE ALREADY ON A CROOKED PATH HE KNEW THAT THE RING WAS NOT LOST FOR EVER BUT WISHED US TO THINK SO FOR HE BEGAN TO LUST FOR IT FOR HIMSELF YET OFT IN LIES TRUTH IS HIDDEN IN THE SEA IT WOULD BE SAFE
NOT SAFE FOR EVER SAID GANDALF THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THE DEEP WATERS AND SEAS AND LANDS MAY CHANGE AND IT IS NOT OUR PART HERE TO TAKE THOUGHT ONLY FOR A SEASON OR FOR A FEW LIVES OF MEN OR FOR A PASSING AGE OF THE WORLD WE SHOULD SEEK A FINAL END OF THIS MENACE EVEN IF WE DO NOT HOPE TO MAKE ONE
AND THAT WE SHALL NOT FIND ON THE ROADS TO THE SEA SAID GALDOR IF THE RETURN TO IARWAIN BE THOUGHT TOO DANGEROUS THEN FLIGHT TO THE SEA IS NOW FRAUGHT WITH GRAVEST PERIL MY HEART TELLS ME THAT SAURON WILL EXPECT US TO TAKE THE WESTERN WAY WHEN HE LEARNS WHAT HAS BEFALLEN HE SOON WILL THE NINE HAVE BEEN UNHORSED INDEED BUT THAT IS BUT A RESPITE ERE THEY FIND NEW STEEDS AND SWIFTER ONLY THE WANING MIGHT OF GONDOR STANDS NOW BETWEEN HIM AND A MARCH IN POWER ALONG THE COASTS INTO THE NORTH AND IF HE COMES ASSAILING THE WHITE TOWERS AND THE HAVENS HEREAFTER THE ELVES MAY HAVE NO ESCAPE FROM THE LENGTHENING SHADOWS OF MIDDLEEARTH
LONG YET WILL THAT MARCH BE DELAYED SAID BOROMIR GONDOR WANES YOU SAY BUT GONDOR STANDS AND EVEN THE END OF ITS STRENGTH IS STILL VERY STRONG
AND YET ITS VIGILANCE CAN NO LONGER KEEP BACK THE NINE SAID GALDOR AND OTHER ROADS HE MAY FIND THAT GONDOR DOES NOT GUARD
THEN SAID ERESTOR THERE ARE BUT TWO COURSES AS GLORFINDEL ALREADY HAS DECLARED TO HIDE THE RING FOR EVER OR TO UNMAKE IT BUT BOTH ARE BEYOND OUR POWER WHO WILL READ THIS RIDDLE FOR US
NONE HERE CAN DO SO SAID ELROND GRAVELY AT LEAST NONE CAN FORETELL WHAT WILL COME TO PASS IF WE TAKE THIS ROAD OR THAT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME NOW CLEAR WHICH IS THE ROAD THAT WE MUST TAKE THE WESTWARD ROAD SEEMS EASIEST THEREFORE IT MUST BE SHUNNED IT WILL BE WATCHED TOO OFTEN THE ELVES HAVE FLED THAT WAY NOW AT THIS LAST WE MUST TAKE A HARD ROAD A ROAD UNFORESEEN THERE LIES OUR HOPE IF HOPE IT BE TO WALK INTO PERIL  TO MORDOR WE MUST SEND THE RING TO THE FIRE
SILENCE FELL AGAIN FRODO EVEN IN THAT FAIR HOUSE LOOKING OUT UPON A SUNLIT VALLEY FILLED WITH THE NOISE OF CLEAR WATERS FELT A DEAD DARKNESS IN HIS HEART BOROMIR STIRRED AND FRODO LOOKED AT HIM HE WAS FINGERING HIS GREAT HORN AND FROWNING AT LENGTH HE SPOKE
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THIS HE SAID SARUMAN IS A TRAITOR BUT DID HE NOT HAVE A GLIMPSE OF WISDOM WHY DO YOU SPEAK EVER OF HIDING AND DESTROYING WHY SHOULD WE NOT THINK THAT THE GREAT RING HAS COME INTO OUR HANDS TO SERVE US IN THE VERY HOUR OF NEED WIELDING IT THE FREE LORDS OF THE FREE MAY SURELY DEFEAT THE ENEMY THAT IS WHAT HE MOST FEARS I DEEM
THE MEN OF GONDOR ARE VALIANT AND THEY WILL NEVER SUBMIT BUT THEY MAY BE BEATEN DOWN VALOUR NEEDS FIRST STRENGTH AND THEN A WEAPON LET THE RING BE YOUR WEAPON IF IT HAS SUCH POWER AS YOU SAY TAKE IT AND GO FORTH TO VICTORY
ALAS NO SAID ELROND WE CANNOT USE THE RULING RING THAT WE NOW KNOW TOO WELL IT BELONGS TO SAURON AND WAS MADE BY HIM ALONE AND IS ALTOGETHER EVIL ITS STRENGTH BOROMIR IS TOO GREAT FOR ANYONE TO WIELD AT WILL SAVE ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY A GREAT POWER OF THEIR OWN BUT FOR THEM IT HOLDS AN EVEN DEADLIER PERIL THE VERY DESIRE OF IT CORRUPTS THE HEART CONSIDER SARUMAN IF ANY OF THE WISE SHOULD WITH THIS RING OVERTHROW THE LORD OF MORDOR USING HIS OWN ARTS HE WOULD THEN SET HIMSELF ON SAURONS THRONE AND YET ANOTHER DARK LORD WOULD APPEAR AND THAT IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THE RING SHOULD BE DESTROYED AS LONG AS IT IS IN THE WORLD IT WILL BE A DANGER EVEN TO THE WISE FOR NOTHING IS EVIL IN THE BEGINNING EVEN SAURON WAS NOT SO I FEAR TO TAKE THE RING TO HIDE IT I WILL NOT TAKE THE RING TO WIELD IT
NOR I SAID GANDALF
BOROMIR LOOKED AT THEM DOUBTFULLY BUT HE BOWED HIS HEAD SO BE IT HE SAID THEN IN GONDOR WE MUST TRUST TO SUCH WEAPONS AS WE HAVE AND AT THE LEAST WHILE THE WISE ONES GUARD THIS RING WE WILL FIGHT ON MAYHAP THE SWORDTHATWASBROKEN MAY STILL STEM THE TIDE  IF THE HAND THAT WIELDS IT HAS INHERITED NOT AN HEIRLOOM ONLY BUT THE SINEWS OF THE KINGS OF MEN
WHO CAN TELL SAID ARAGORN BUT WE WILL PUT IT TO THE TEST ONE DAY
MAY THE DAY NOT BE TOO LONG DELAYED SAID BOROMIR FOR THOUGH I DO NOT ASK FOR AID WE NEED IT IT WOULD COMFORT US TO KNOW THAT OTHERS FOUGHT ALSO WITH ALL THE MEANS THAT THEY HAVE
THEN BE COMFORTED SAID ELROND FOR THERE ARE OTHER POWERS AND REALMS THAT YOU KNOW NOT AND THEY ARE HIDDEN FROM YOU ANDUIN THE GREAT FLOWS PAST MANY SHORES ERE IT COMES TO ARGONATH AND THE GATES OF GONDOR
STILL IT MIGHT BE WELL FOR ALL SAID GLOIN THE DWARF IF ALL THESE STRENGTHS WERE JOINED AND THE POWERS OF EACH WERE USED IN LEAGUE OTHER RINGS THERE MAY BE LESS TREACHEROUS THAT MIGHT BE USED IN OUR NEED THE SEVEN ARE LOST TO US  IF BALIN HAS NOT FOUND THE RING OF THROR WHICH WAS THE LAST NAUGHT HAS BEEN HEARD OF IT SINCE THROR PERISHED IN MORIA INDEED I MAY NOW REVEAL THAT IT WAS PARTLY IN HOPE TO FIND THAT RING THAT BALIN WENT AWAY
BALIN WILL FIND NO RING IN MORIA SAID GANDALF THROR GAVE IT TO THRAIN HIS SON BUT NOT THRAIN TO THORIN IT WAS TAKEN WITH TORMENT FROM THRAIN IN THE DUNGEONS OF DOL GULDUR I CAME TOO LATE
AH ALAS CRIED GLOIN WHEN WILL THE DAY COME OF OUR REVENGE BUT STILL THERE ARE THE THREE WHAT OF THE THREE RINGS OF THE ELVES VERY MIGHTY RINGS IT IS SAID DO NOT THE ELFLORDS KEEP THEM YET THEY TOO WERE MADE BY THE DARK LORD LONG AGO ARE THEY IDLE I SEE ELFLORDS HERE WILL THEY NOT SAY
THE ELVES RETURNED NO ANSWER DID YOU NOT HEAR ME GLOIN SAID ELROND THE THREE WERE NOT MADE BY SAURON NOR DID HE EVER TOUCH THEM BUT OF THEM IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO SPEAK SO MUCH ONLY IN THIS HOUR OF DOUBT I MAY NOW SAY THEY ARE NOT IDLE BUT THEY WERE NOT MADE AS WEAPONS OF WAR OR CONQUEST THAT IS NOT THEIR POWER THOSE WHO MADE THEM DID NOT DESIRE STRENGTH OR DOMINATION OR HOARDED WEALTH BUT UNDERSTANDING MAKING AND HEALING TO PRESERVE ALL THINGS UNSTAINED THESE THINGS THE ELVES OF MIDDLEEARTH HAVE IN SOME MEASURE GAINED THOUGH WITH SORROW BUT ALL THAT HAS BEEN WROUGHT BY THOSE WHO WIELD THE THREE WILL TURN TO THEIR UNDOING AND THEIR MINDS AND HEARTS WILL BECOME REVEALED TO SAURON IF HE REGAINS THE ONE IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE THREE HAD NEVER BEEN THAT IS HIS PURPOSE
BUT WHAT THEN WOULD HAPPEN IF THE RULING RING WERE DESTROYED AS YOU COUNSEL ASKED GLOIN
WE KNOW NOT FOR CERTAIN ANSWERED ELROND SADLY SOME HOPE THAT THE THREE RINGS WHICH SAURON HAS NEVER TOUCHED WOULD THEN BECOME FREE AND THEIR RULERS MIGHT HEAL THE HURTS OF THE WORLD THAT HE HAS WROUGHT BUT MAYBE WHEN THE ONE HAS GONE THE THREE WILL FAIL AND MANY FAIR THINGS WILL FADE AND BE FORGOTTEN THAT IS MY BELIEF
YET ALL THE ELVES ARE WILLING TO ENDURE THIS CHANCE SAID GLORFINDEL IF BY IT THE POWER OF SAURON MAY BE BROKEN AND THE FEAR OF HIS DOMINION BE TAKEN AWAY FOR EVER
THUS WE RETURN ONCE MORE TO THE DESTROYING OF THE RING SAID ERESTOR AND YET WE COME NO NEARER WHAT STRENGTH HAVE WE FOR THE FINDING OF THE FIRE IN WHICH IT WAS MADE THAT IS THE PATH OF DESPAIR OF FOLLY I WOULD SAY IF THE LONG WISDOM OF ELROND DID NOT FORBID ME
DESPAIR OR FOLLY SAID GANDALF IT IS NOT DESPAIR FOR DESPAIR IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO SEE THE END BEYOND ALL DOUBT WE DO NOT IT IS WISDOM TO RECOGNIZE NECESSITY WHEN ALL OTHER COURSES HAVE BEEN WEIGHED THOUGH AS FOLLY IT MAY APPEAR TO THOSE WHO CLING TO FALSE HOPE WELL LET FOLLY BE OUR CLOAK A VEIL BEFORE THE EYES OF THE ENEMY FOR HE IS VERY WISE AND WEIGHS ALL THINGS TO A NICETY IN THE SCALES OF HIS MALICE BUT THE ONLY MEASURE THAT HE KNOWS IS DESIRE DESIRE FOR POWER AND SO HE JUDGES ALL HEARTS INTO HIS HEART THE THOUGHT WILL NOT ENTER THAT ANY WILL REFUSE IT THAT HAVING THE RING WE MAY SEEK TO DESTROY IT IF WE SEEK THIS WE SHALL PUT HIM OUT OF RECKONING
AT LEAST FOR A WHILE SAID ELROND THE ROAD MUST BE TROD BUT IT WILL BE VERY HARD AND NEITHER STRENGTH NOR WISDOM WILL CARRY US FAR UPON IT THIS QUEST MAY BE ATTEMPTED BY THE WEAK WITH AS MUCH HOPE AS THE STRONG YET SUCH IS OFT THE COURSE OF DEEDS THAT MOVE THE WHEELS OF THE WORLD SMALL HANDS DO THEM BECAUSE THEY MUST WHILE THE EYES OF THE GREAT ARE ELSEWHERE
VERY WELL VERY WELL MASTER ELROND SAID BILBO SUDDENLY SAY NO MORE IT IS PLAIN ENOUGH WHAT YOU ARE POINTING AT BILBO THE SILLY HOBBIT STARTED THIS AFFAIR AND BILBO HAD BETTER FINISH IT OR HIMSELF I WAS VERY COMFORTABLE HERE AND GETTING ON WITH MY BOOK IF YOU WANT TO KNOW I AM JUST WRITING AN ENDING FOR IT I HAD THOUGHT OF PUTTING AND HE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARDS TO THE END OF HIS DAYS IT IS A GOOD ENDING AND NONE THE WORSE FOR HAVING BEEN USED BEFORE NOW I SHALL HAVE TO ALTER THAT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE COMING TRUE AND ANYWAY THERE WILL EVIDENTLY HAVE TO BE SEVERAL MORE CHAPTERS IF I LIVE TO WRITE THEM IT IS A FRIGHTFUL NUISANCE WHEN OUGHT I TO START
BOROMIR LOOKED IN SURPRISE AT BILBO BUT THE LAUGHTER DIED ON HIS LIPS WHEN HE SAW THAT ALL THE OTHERS REGARDED THE OLD HOBBIT WITH GRAVE RESPECT ONLY GLOIN SMILED BUT HIS SMILE CAME FROM OLD MEMORIES
OF COURSE MY DEAR BILBO SAID GANDALF IF YOU HAD REALLY STARTED THIS AFFAIR YOU MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO FINISH IT BUT YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH NOW THAT STARTING IS TOO GREAT A CLAIM FOR ANY AND THAT ONLY A SMALL PART IS PLAYED IN GREAT DEEDS BY ANY HERO YOU NEED NOT BOW THOUGH THE WORD WAS MEANT AND WE DO NOT DOUBT THAT UNDER JEST YOU ARE MAKING A VALIANT OFFER BUT ONE BEYOND YOUR STRENGTH BILBO YOU CANNOT TAKE THIS THING BACK IT HAS PASSED ON IF YOU NEED MY ADVICE ANY LONGER I SHOULD SAY THAT YOUR PART IS ENDED UNLESS AS A RECORDER FINISH YOUR BOOK AND LEAVE THE ENDING UNALTERED THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR IT BUT GET READY TO WRITE A SEQUEL WHEN THEY COME BACK
BILBO LAUGHED I HAVE NEVER KNOWN YOU GIVE ME PLEASANT ADVICE BEFORE HE SAID AS ALL YOUR UNPLEASANT ADVICE HAS BEEN GOOD I WONDER IF THIS ADVICE IS NOT BAD STILL I DONT SUPPOSE I HAVE THE STRENGTH OR LUCK LEFT TO DEAL WITH THE RING IT HAS GROWN AND I HAVE NOT BUT TELL ME WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THEY 
THE MESSENGERS WHO ARE SENT WITH THE RING
EXACTLY AND WHO ARE THEY TO BE THAT SEEMS TO ME WHAT THIS COUNCIL HAS TO DECIDE AND ALL THAT IT HAS TO DECIDE ELVES MAY THRIVE ON SPEECH ALONE AND DWARVES ENDURE GREAT WEARINESS BUT I AM ONLY AN OLD HOBBIT AND I MISS MY MEAL AT NOON CANT YOU THINK OF SOME NAMES NOW OR PUT IT OFF TILL AFTER DINNER
NO ONE ANSWERED THE NOONBELL RANG STILL NO ONE SPOKE FRODO GLANCED AT ALL THE FACES BUT THEY WERE NOT TURNED TO HIM ALL THE COUNCIL SAT WITH DOWNCAST EYES AS IF IN DEEP THOUGHT A GREAT DREAD FELL ON HIM AS IF HE WAS AWAITING THE PRONOUNCEMENT OF SOME DOOM THAT HE HAD LONG FORESEEN AND VAINLY HOPED MIGHT AFTER ALL NEVER BE SPOKEN AN OVERWHELMING LONGING TO REST AND REMAIN AT PEACE BY BILBOS SIDE IN RIVENDELL FILLED ALL HIS HEART AT LAST WITH AN EFFORT HE SPOKE AND WONDERED TO HEAR HIS OWN WORDS AS IF SOME OTHER WILL WAS USING HIS SMALL VOICE
I WILL TAKE THE RING HE SAID THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW THE WAY
ELROND RAISED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT HIM AND FRODO FELT HIS HEART PIERCED BY THE SUDDEN KEENNESS OF THE GLANCE IF I UNDERSTAND ARIGHT ALL THAT I HAVE HEARD HE SAID I THINK THAT THIS TASK IS APPOINTED FOR YOU FRODO AND THAT IF YOU DO NOT FIND A WAY NO ONE WILL THIS IS THE HOUR OF THE SHIREFOLK WHEN THEY ARISE FROM THEIR QUIET FIELDS TO SHAKE THE TOWERS AND COUNSELS OF THE GREAT WHO OF ALL THE WISE COULD HAVE FORESEEN IT OR IF THEY ARE WISE WHY SHOULD THEY EXPECT TO KNOW IT UNTIL THE HOUR HAS STRUCK
BUT IT IS A HEAVY BURDEN SO HEAVY THAT NONE COULD LAY IT ON ANOTHER I DO NOT LAY IT ON YOU BUT IF YOU TAKE IT FREELY I WILL SAY THAT YOUR CHOICE IS RIGHT AND THOUGH ALL THE MIGHTY ELFFRIENDS OF OLD HADOR AND HURIN AND TURIN AND BEREN HIMSELF WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER YOUR SEAT SHOULD BE AMONG THEM
BUT YOU WONT SEND HIM OFF ALONE SURELY MASTER CRIED SAM UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIMSELF ANY LONGER AND JUMPING UP FROM THE CORNER WHERE HE HAD BEEN QUIETLY SITTING ON THE FLOOR
NO INDEED SAID ELROND TURNING TOWARDS HIM WITH A SMILE YOU AT LEAST SHALL GO WITH HIM IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE YOU FROM HIM EVEN WHEN HE IS SUMMONED TO A SECRET COUNCIL AND YOU ARE NOT
SAM SAT DOWN BLUSHING AND MUTTERING A NICE PICKLE WE HAVE LANDED OURSELVES IN MR FRODO HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD



CHAPTER 3
THE RING GOES SOUTH

LATER THAT DAY THE HOBBITS HELD A MEETING OF THEIR OWN IN BILBOS ROOM MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE INDIGNANT WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SAM HAD CREPT INTO THE COUNCIL AND HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS FRODOS COMPANION
ITS MOST UNFAIR SAID PIPPIN INSTEAD OF THROWING HIM OUT AND CLAPPING HIM IN CHAINS ELROND GOES AND REWARDS HIM FOR HIS CHEEK
REWARDS SAID FRODO I CANT IMAGINE A MORE SEVERE PUNISHMENT YOU ARE NOT THINKING WHAT YOU ARE SAYING CONDEMNED TO GO ON THIS HOPELESS JOURNEY A REWARD YESTERDAY I DREAMED THAT MY TASK WAS DONE AND I COULD REST HERE A LONG WHILE PERHAPS FOR GOOD
I DONT WONDER SAID MERRY AND I WISH YOU COULD BUT WE ARE ENVYING SAM NOT YOU IF YOU HAVE TO GO THEN IT WILL BE A PUNISHMENT FOR ANY OF US TO BE LEFT BEHIND EVEN IN RIVENDELL WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY WITH YOU AND BEEN THROUGH SOME STIFF TIMES WE WANT TO GO ON
THATS WHAT I MEANT SAID PIPPIN WE HOBBITS OUGHT TO STICK TOGETHER AND WE WILL I SHALL GO UNLESS THEY CHAIN ME UP THERE MUST BE SOMEONE WITH INTELLIGENCE IN THE PARTY
THEN YOU CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE CHOSEN PEREGRIN TOOK SAID GANDALF LOOKING IN THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH WAS NEAR THE GROUND BUT YOU ARE ALL WORRYING YOURSELVES UNNECESSARILY NOTHING IS DECIDED YET
NOTHING DECIDED CRIED PIPPIN THEN WHAT WERE YOU ALL DOING YOU WERE SHUT UP FOR HOURS
TALKING SAID BILBO THERE WAS A DEAL OF TALK AND EVERYONE HAD AN EYEOPENER EVEN OLD GANDALF I THINK LEGOLASS BIT OF NEWS ABOUT GOLLUM CAUGHT EVEN HIM ON THE HOP THOUGH HE PASSED IT OFF
YOU WERE WRONG SAID GANDALF YOU WERE INATTENTIVE I HAD ALREADY HEARD OF IT FROM GWAIHIR IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ONLY REAL EYEOPENERS AS YOU PUT IT WERE YOU AND FRODO AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS NOT SURPRISED
WELL ANYWAY SAID BILBO NOTHING WAS DECIDED BEYOND CHOOSING POOR FRODO AND SAM I WAS AFRAID ALL THE TIME THAT IT MIGHT COME TO THAT IF I WAS LET OFF BUT IF YOU ASK ME ELROND WILL SEND OUT A FAIR NUMBER WHEN THE REPORTS COME IN HAVE THEY STARTED YET GANDALF
YES SAID THE WIZARD SOME OF THE SCOUTS HAVE BEEN SENT OUT ALREADY MORE WILL GO TOMORROW ELROND IS SENDING ELVES AND THEY WILL GET IN TOUCH WITH THE RANGERS AND MAYBE WITH THRANDUILS FOLK IN MIRKWOOD AND ARAGORN HAS GONE WITH ELRONDS SONS WE SHALL HAVE TO SCOUR THE LANDS ALL ROUND FOR MANY LONG LEAGUES BEFORE ANY MOVE IS MADE SO CHEER UP FRODO YOU WILL PROBABLY MAKE QUITE A LONG STAY HERE
AH SAID SAM GLOOMILY WELL JUST WAIT LONG ENOUGH FOR WINTER TO COME
THAT CANT BE HELPED SAID BILBO ITS YOUR FAULT PARTLY FRODO MY LAD INSISTING ON WAITING FOR MY BIRTHDAY A FUNNY WAY OF HONOURING IT I CANT HELP THINKING NOT THE DAY I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR LETTING THE SBS INTO BAG END BUT THERE IT IS YOU CANT WAIT NOW TILL SPRING AND YOU CANT GO TILL THE REPORTS COME BACK
WHEN WINTER FIRST BEGINS TO BITE
AND STONES CRACK IN THE FROSTY NIGHT
WHEN POOLS ARE BLACK AND TREES ARE BARE
TIS EVIL IN THE WILD TO FARE

BUT THAT I AM AFRAID WILL BE JUST YOUR LUCK
I AM AFRAID IT WILL SAID GANDALF WE CANT START UNTIL WE HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE RIDERS
I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALL DESTROYED IN THE FLOOD SAID MERRY
YOU CANNOT DESTROY RINGWRAITHS LIKE THAT SAID GANDALF THE POWER OF THEIR MASTER IS IN THEM AND THEY STAND OR FALL BY HIM WE HOPE THAT THEY WERE ALL UNHORSED AND UNMASKED AND SO MADE FOR A WHILE LESS DANGEROUS BUT WE MUST FIND OUT FOR CERTAIN IN THE MEANTIME YOU SHOULD TRY AND FORGET YOUR TROUBLES FRODO I DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU BUT I WILL WHISPER THIS IN YOUR EARS SOMEONE SAID THAT INTELLIGENCE WOULD BE NEEDED IN THE PARTY HE WAS RIGHT I THINK I SHALL COME WITH YOU
SO GREAT WAS FRODOS DELIGHT AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT GANDALF LEFT THE WINDOWSILL WHERE HE HAD BEEN SITTING AND TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND BOWED I ONLY SAID I THINK I SHALL COME DO NOT COUNT ON ANYTHING YET IN THIS MATTER ELROND WILL HAVE MUCH TO SAY AND YOUR FRIEND THE STRIDER WHICH REMINDS ME I WANT TO SEE ELROND I MUST BE OFF
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK I SHALL HAVE HERE SAID FRODO TO BILBO WHEN GANDALF HAD GONE
OH I DONT KNOW I CANT COUNT DAYS IN RIVENDELL SAID BILBO BUT QUITE LONG I SHOULD THINK WE CAN HAVE MANY A GOOD TALK WHAT ABOUT HELPING ME WITH MY BOOK AND MAKING A START ON THE NEXT HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF AN ENDING
YES SEVERAL AND ALL ARE DARK AND UNPLEASANT SAID FRODO
OH THAT WONT DO SAID BILBO BOOKS OUGHT TO HAVE GOOD ENDINGS HOW WOULD THIS DO AND THEY ALL SETTLED DOWN AND LIVED TOGETHER HAPPILY EVER AFTER 
IT WILL DO WELL IF IT EVER COMES TO THAT SAID FRODO
AH SAID SAM AND WHERE WILL THEY LIVE THATS WHAT I OFTEN WONDER
FOR A WHILE THE HOBBITS CONTINUED TO TALK AND THINK OF THE PAST JOURNEY AND OF THE PERILS THAT LAY AHEAD BUT SUCH WAS THE VIRTUE OF THE LAND OF RIVENDELL THAT SOON ALL FEAR AND ANXIETY WAS LIFTED FROM THEIR MINDS THE FUTURE GOOD OR ILL WAS NOT FORGOTTEN BUT CEASED TO HAVE ANY POWER OVER THE PRESENT HEALTH AND HOPE GREW STRONG IN THEM AND THEY WERE CONTENT WITH EACH GOOD DAY AS IT CAME TAKING PLEASURE IN EVERY MEAL AND IN EVERY WORD AND SONG
SO THE DAYS SLIPPED AWAY AS EACH MORNING DAWNED BRIGHT AND FAIR AND EACH EVENING FOLLOWED COOL AND CLEAR BUT AUTUMN WAS WANING FAST SLOWLY THE GOLDEN LIGHT FADED TO PALE SILVER AND THE LINGERING LEAVES FELL FROM THE NAKED TREES A WIND BEGAN TO BLOW CHILL FROM THE MISTY MOUNTAINS TO THE EAST THE HUNTERS MOON WAXED ROUND IN THE NIGHT SKY AND PUT TO FLIGHT ALL THE LESSER STARS BUT LOW IN THE SOUTH ONE STAR SHONE RED EVERY NIGHT AS THE MOON WANED AGAIN IT SHONE BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER FRODO COULD SEE IT FROM HIS WINDOW DEEP IN THE HEAVENS BURNING LIKE A WATCHFUL EYE THAT GLARED ABOVE THE TREES ON THE BRINK OF THE VALLEY
THE HOBBITS HAD BEEN NEARLY TWO MONTHS IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND AND NOVEMBER HAD GONE BY WITH THE LAST SHREDS OF AUTUMN AND DECEMBER WAS PASSING WHEN THE SCOUTS BEGAN TO RETURN SOME HAD GONE NORTH BEYOND THE SPRINGS OF THE HOARWELL INTO THE ETTENMOORS AND OTHERS HAD GONE WEST AND WITH THE HELP OF ARAGORN AND THE RANGERS HAD SEARCHED THE LANDS FAR DOWN THE GREYFLOOD AS FAR AS THARBAD WHERE THE OLD NORTH ROAD CROSSED THE RIVER BY A RUINED TOWN MANY HAD GONE EAST AND SOUTH AND SOME OF THESE HAD CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS AND ENTERED MIRKWOOD WHILE OTHERS HAD CLIMBED THE PASS AT THE SOURCE OF THE GLADDEN RIVER AND HAD COME DOWN INTO WILDERLAND AND OVER THE GLADDEN FIELDS AND SO AT LENGTH HAD REACHED THE OLD HOME OF RADAGAST AT RHOSGOBEL RADAGAST WAS NOT THERE AND THEY HAD RETURNED OVER THE HIGH PASS THAT WAS CALLED THE DIMRILL STAIR THE SONS OF ELROND ELLADAN AND ELROHIR WERE THE LAST TO RETURN THEY HAD MADE A GREAT JOURNEY PASSING DOWN THE SILVERLODE INTO A STRANGE COUNTRY BUT OF THEIR ERRAND THEY WOULD NOT SPEAK TO ANY SAVE TO ELROND
IN NO REGION HAD THE MESSENGERS DISCOVERED ANY SIGNS OR TIDINGS OF THE RIDERS OR OTHER SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY EVEN FROM THE EAGLES OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS THEY HAD LEARNED NO FRESH NEWS NOTHING HAD BEEN SEEN OR HEARD OF GOLLUM BUT THE WILD WOLVES WERE STILL GATHERING AND WERE HUNTING AGAIN FAR UP THE GREAT RIVER THREE OF THE BLACK HORSES HAD BEEN FOUND AT ONCE DROWNED IN THE FLOODED FORD ON THE ROCKS OF THE RAPIDS BELOW IT SEARCHERS DISCOVERED THE BODIES OF FIVE MORE AND ALSO A LONG BLACK CLOAK SLASHED AND TATTERED OF THE BLACK RIDERS NO OTHER TRACE WAS TO BE SEEN AND NOWHERE WAS THEIR PRESENCE TO BE FELT IT SEEMED THAT THEY HAD VANISHED FROM THE NORTH
EIGHT OUT OF THE NINE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT LEAST SAID GANDALF IT IS RASH TO BE TOO SURE YET I THINK THAT WE MAY HOPE NOW THAT THE RINGWRAITHS WERE SCATTERED AND HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO RETURN AS BEST THEY COULD TO THEIR MASTER IN MORDOR EMPTY AND SHAPELESS
IF THAT IS SO IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY CAN BEGIN THE HUNT AGAIN OF COURSE THE ENEMY HAS OTHER SERVANTS BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO JOURNEY ALL THE WAY TO THE BORDERS OF RIVENDELL BEFORE THEY CAN PICK UP OUR TRAIL AND IF WE ARE CAREFUL THAT WILL BE HARD TO FIND BUT WE MUST DELAY NO LONGER
ELROND SUMMONED THE HOBBITS TO HIM HE LOOKED GRAVELY AT FRODO THE TIME HAS COME HE SAID IF THE RING IS TO SET OUT IT MUST GO SOON BUT THOSE WHO GO WITH IT MUST NOT COUNT ON THEIR ERRAND BEING AIDED BY WAR OR FORCE THEY MUST PASS INTO THE DOMAIN OF THE ENEMY FAR FROM AID DO YOU STILL HOLD TO YOUR WORD FRODO THAT YOU WILL BE THE RINGBEARER
I DO SAID FRODO I WILL GO WITH SAM
THEN I CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH NOT EVEN WITH COUNSEL SAID ELROND I CAN FORESEE VERY LITTLE OF YOUR ROAD AND HOW YOUR TASK IS TO BE ACHIEVED I DO NOT KNOW THE SHADOW HAS CREPT NOW TO THE FEET OF THE MOUNTAINS AND DRAWS NIGH EVEN TO THE BORDERS OF GREYFLOOD AND UNDER THE SHADOW ALL IS DARK TO ME YOU WILL MEET MANY FOES SOME OPEN AND SOME DISGUISED AND YOU MAY FIND FRIENDS UPON YOUR WAY WHEN YOU LEAST LOOK FOR IT I WILL SEND OUT MESSAGES SUCH AS I CAN CONTRIVE TO THOSE WHOM I KNOW IN THE WIDE WORLD BUT SO PERILOUS ARE THE LANDS NOW BECOME THAT SOME MAY WELL MISCARRY OR COME NO QUICKER THAN YOU YOURSELF
AND I WILL CHOOSE YOU COMPANIONS TO GO WITH YOU AS FAR AS THEY WILL OR FORTUNE ALLOWS THE NUMBER MUST BE FEW SINCE YOUR HOPE IS IN SPEED AND SECRECY HAD I A HOST OF ELVES IN ARMOUR OF THE ELDER DAYS IT WOULD AVAIL LITTLE SAVE TO AROUSE THE POWER OF MORDOR
THE COMPANY OF THE RING SHALL BE NINE AND THE NINE WALKERS SHALL BE SET AGAINST THE NINE RIDERS THAT ARE EVIL WITH YOU AND YOUR FAITHFUL SERVANT GANDALF WILL GO FOR THIS SHALL BE HIS GREAT TASK AND MAYBE THE END OF HIS LABOURS
FOR THE REST THEY SHALL REPRESENT THE OTHER FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ELVES DWARVES AND MEN LEGOLAS SHALL BE FOR THE ELVES AND GIMLI SON OF GLOIN FOR THE DWARVES THEY ARE WILLING TO GO AT LEAST TO THE PASSES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND MAYBE BEYOND FOR MEN YOU SHALL HAVE ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN FOR THE RING OF ISILDUR CONCERNS HIM CLOSELY
STRIDER SAID FRODO
YES HE SAID WITH A SMILE I ASK LEAVE ONCE AGAIN TO BE YOUR COMPANION FRODO
I WOULD HAVE BEGGED YOU TO COME SAID FRODO ONLY I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO MINAS TIRITH WITH BOROMIR
I AM SAID ARAGORN AND THE SWORDTHATWASBROKEN SHALL BE REFORGED ERE I SET OUT TO WAR BUT YOUR ROAD AND OUR ROAD LIE TOGETHER FOR MANY HUNDREDS OF MILES THEREFORE BOROMIR WILL ALSO BE IN THE COMPANY HE IS A VALIANT MAN
THERE REMAIN TWO MORE TO BE FOUND SAID ELROND THESE I WILL CONSIDER OF MY HOUSEHOLD I MAY FIND SOME THAT IT SEEMS GOOD TO ME TO SEND
BUT THAT WILL LEAVE NO PLACE FOR US CRIED PIPPIN IN DISMAY WE DONT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND WE WANT TO GO WITH FRODO
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT LIES AHEAD SAID ELROND
NEITHER DOES FRODO SAID GANDALF UNEXPECTEDLY SUPPORTING PIPPIN NOR DO ANY OF US SEE CLEARLY IT IS TRUE THAT IF THESE HOBBITS UNDERSTOOD THE DANGER THEY WOULD NOT DARE TO GO BUT THEY WOULD STILL WISH TO GO OR WISH THAT THEY DARED AND BE SHAMED AND UNHAPPY I THINK ELROND THAT IN THIS MATTER IT WOULD BE WELL TO TRUST RATHER TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP THAN TO GREAT WISDOM EVEN IF YOU CHOSE FOR US AN ELFLORD SUCH AS GLORFINDEL HE COULD NOT STORM THE DARK TOWER NOR OPEN THE ROAD TO THE FIRE BY THE POWER THAT IS IN HIM
YOU SPEAK GRAVELY SAID ELROND BUT I AM IN DOUBT THE SHIRE I FOREBODE IS NOT FREE NOW FROM PERIL AND THESE TWO I HAD THOUGHT TO SEND BACK THERE AS MESSENGERS TO DO WHAT THEY COULD ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THEIR COUNTRY TO WARN THE PEOPLE OF THEIR DANGER IN ANY CASE I JUDGE THAT THE YOUNGER OF THESE TWO PEREGRIN TOOK SHOULD REMAIN MY HEART IS AGAINST HIS GOING
THEN MASTER ELROND YOU WILL HAVE TO LOCK ME IN PRISON OR SEND ME HOME TIED IN A SACK SAID PIPPIN FOR OTHERWISE I SHALL FOLLOW THE COMPANY
LET IT BE SO THEN YOU SHALL GO SAID ELROND AND HE SIGHED NOW THE TALE OF NINE IS FILLED IN SEVEN DAYS THE COMPANY MUST DEPART
THE SWORD OF ELENDIL WAS FORGED ANEW BY ELVISH SMITHS AND ON ITS BLADE WAS TRACED A DEVICE OF SEVEN STARS SET BETWEEN THE CRESCENT MOON AND THE RAYED SUN AND ABOUT THEM WAS WRITTEN MANY RUNES FOR ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN WAS GOING TO WAR UPON THE MARCHES OF MORDOR VERY BRIGHT WAS THAT SWORD WHEN IT WAS MADE WHOLE AGAIN THE LIGHT OF THE SUN SHONE REDLY IN IT AND THE LIGHT OF THE MOON SHONE COLD AND ITS EDGE WAS HARD AND KEEN AND ARAGORN GAVE IT A NEW NAME AND CALLED IT ANDURIL FLAME OF THE WEST
ARAGORN AND GANDALF WALKED TOGETHER OR SAT SPEAKING OF THEIR ROAD AND THE PERILS THEY WOULD MEET AND THEY PONDERED THE STORIED AND FIGURED MAPS AND BOOKS OF LORE THAT WERE IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND SOMETIMES FRODO WAS WITH THEM BUT HE WAS CONTENT TO LEAN ON THEIR GUIDANCE AND HE SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS HE COULD WITH BILBO
IN THOSE LAST DAYS THE HOBBITS SAT TOGETHER IN THE EVENING IN THE HALL OF FIRE AND THERE AMONG MANY TALES THEY HEARD TOLD IN FULL THE LAY OF BEREN AND LUTHIEN AND THE WINNING OF THE GREAT JEWEL BUT IN THE DAY WHILE MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE OUT AND ABOUT FRODO AND SAM WERE TO BE FOUND WITH BILBO IN HIS OWN SMALL ROOM THEN BILBO WOULD READ PASSAGES FROM HIS BOOK WHICH STILL SEEMED VERY INCOMPLETE OR SCRAPS OF HIS VERSES OR WOULD TAKE NOTES OF FRODOS ADVENTURES
ON THE MORNING OF THE LAST DAY FRODO WAS ALONE WITH BILBO AND THE OLD HOBBIT PULLED OUT FROM UNDER HIS BED A WOODEN BOX HE LIFTED THE LID AND FUMBLED INSIDE
HERE IS YOUR SWORD HE SAID BUT IT WAS BROKEN YOU KNOW I TOOK IT TO KEEP IT SAFE BUT IVE FORGOTTEN TO ASK IF THE SMITHS COULD MEND IT NO TIME NOW SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WOULD CARE TO HAVE THIS DONT YOU KNOW
HE TOOK FROM THE BOX A SMALL SWORD IN AN OLD SHABBY LEATHERN SCABBARD THEN HE DREW IT AND ITS POLISHED AND WELLTENDED BLADE GLITTERED SUDDENLY COLD AND BRIGHT THIS IS STING HE SAID AND THRUST IT WITH LITTLE EFFORT DEEP INTO A WOODEN BEAM TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE I SHANT WANT IT AGAIN I EXPECT
FRODO ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY
ALSO THERE IS THIS SAID BILBO BRINGING OUT A PARCEL WHICH SEEMED TO BE RATHER HEAVY FOR ITS SIZE HE UNWOUND SEVERAL FOLDS OF OLD CLOTH AND HELD UP A SMALL SHIRT OF MAIL IT WAS CLOSEWOVEN OF MANY RINGS AS SUPPLE ALMOST AS LINEN COLD AS ICE AND HARDER THAN STEEL IT SHONE LIKE MOONLIT SILVER AND WAS STUDDED WITH WHITE GEMS WITH IT WAS A BELT OF PEARL AND CRYSTAL
ITS A PRETTY THING ISNT IT SAID BILBO MOVING IT IN THE LIGHT AND USEFUL IT IS MY DWARFMAIL THAT THORIN GAVE ME I GOT IT BACK FROM MICHEL DELVING BEFORE I STARTED AND PACKED IT WITH MY LUGGAGE I BROUGHT ALL THE MEMENTOES OF MY JOURNEY AWAY WITH ME EXCEPT THE RING BUT I DID NOT EXPECT TO USE THIS AND I DONT NEED IT NOW EXCEPT TO LOOK AT SOMETIMES YOU HARDLY FEEL ANY WEIGHT WHEN YOU PUT IT ON
I SHOULD LOOK  WELL I DONT THINK I SHOULD LOOK RIGHT IN IT SAID FRODO
JUST WHAT I SAID MYSELF SAID BILBO BUT NEVER MIND ABOUT LOOKS YOU CAN WEAR IT UNDER YOUR OUTER CLOTHES COME ON YOU MUST SHARE THIS SECRET WITH ME DONT TELL ANYBODY ELSE BUT I SHOULD FEEL HAPPIER IF I KNEW YOU WERE WEARING IT I HAVE A FANCY IT WOULD TURN EVEN THE KNIVES OF THE BLACK RIDERS HE ENDED IN A LOW VOICE
VERY WELL I WILL TAKE IT SAID FRODO BILBO PUT IT ON HIM AND FASTENED STING UPON THE GLITTERING BELT AND THEN FRODO PUT OVER THE TOP HIS OLD WEATHERSTAINED BREECHES TUNIC AND JACKET
JUST A PLAIN HOBBIT YOU LOOK SAID BILBO BUT THERE IS MORE ABOUT YOU NOW THAN APPEARS ON THE SURFACE GOOD LUCK TO YOU HE TURNED AWAY AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TRYING TO HUM A TUNE
I CANNOT THANK YOU AS I SHOULD BILBO FOR THIS AND FOR ALL OUR PAST KINDNESSES SAID FRODO
DONT TRY SAID THE OLD HOBBIT TURNING ROUND AND SLAPPING HIM ON THE BACK OW HE CRIED YOU ARE TOO HARD NOW TO SLAP BUT THERE YOU ARE HOBBITS MUST STICK TOGETHER AND ESPECIALLY BAGGINSES ALL I ASK IN RETURN IS TAKE AS MUCH CARE OF YOURSELF AS YOU CAN AND BRING BACK ALL THE NEWS YOU CAN AND ANY OLD SONGS AND TALES YOU CAN COME BY ILL DO MY BEST TO FINISH MY BOOK BEFORE YOU RETURN I SHOULD LIKE TO WRITE THE SECOND BOOK IF I AM SPARED HE BROKE OFF AND TURNED TO THE WINDOW AGAIN SINGING SOFTLY
I SIT BESIDE THE FIRE AND THINK
OF ALL THAT I HAVE SEEN
OF MEADOWFLOWERS AND BUTTERFLIES
IN SUMMERS THAT HAVE BEEN

OF YELLOW LEAVES AND GOSSAMER
IN AUTUMNS THAT THERE WERE
WITH MORNING MIST AND SILVER SUN
AND WIND UPON MY HAIR

I SIT BESIDE THE FIRE AND THINK
OF HOW THE WORLD WILL BE
WHEN WINTER COMES WITHOUT A SPRING
THAT I SHALL EVER SEE

FOR STILL THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN
IN EVERY WOOD IN EVERY SPRING
THERE IS A DIFFERENT GREEN

I SIT BESIDE THE FIRE AND THINK
OF PEOPLE LONG AGO
AND PEOPLE WHO WILL SEE A WORLD
THAT I SHALL NEVER KNOW

BUT ALL THE WHILE I SIT AND THINK
OF TIMES THERE WERE BEFORE
I LISTEN FOR RETURNING FEET
AND VOICES AT THE DOOR

IT WAS A COLD GREY DAY NEAR THE END OF DECEMBER THE EAST WIND WAS STREAMING THROUGH THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND SEETHING IN THE DARK PINES ON THE HILLS RAGGED CLOUDS WERE HURRYING OVERHEAD DARK AND LOW AS THE CHEERLESS SHADOWS OF THE EARLY EVENING BEGAN TO FALL THE COMPANY MADE READY TO SET OUT THEY WERE TO START AT DUSK FOR ELROND COUNSELLED THEM TO JOURNEY UNDER COVER OF NIGHT AS OFTEN AS THEY COULD UNTIL THEY WERE FAR FROM RIVENDELL
YOU SHOULD FEAR THE MANY EYES OF THE SERVANTS OF SAURON HE SAID I DO NOT DOUBT THAT NEWS OF THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE RIDERS HAS ALREADY REACHED HIM AND HE WILL BE FILLED WITH WRATH SOON NOW HIS SPIES ON FOOT AND WING WILL BE ABROAD IN THE NORTHERN LANDS EVEN OF THE SKY ABOVE YOU MUST BEWARE AS YOU GO ON YOUR WAY
THE COMPANY TOOK LITTLE GEAR OF WAR FOR THEIR HOPE WAS IN SECRECY NOT IN BATTLE ARAGORN HAD ANDURIL BUT NO OTHER WEAPON AND HE WENT FORTH CLAD ONLY IN RUSTY GREEN AND BROWN AS A RANGER OF THE WILDERNESS BOROMIR HAD A LONG SWORD IN FASHION LIKE ANDURIL BUT OF LESS LINEAGE AND HE BORE ALSO A SHIELD AND HIS WARHORN
LOUD AND CLEAR IT SOUNDS IN THE VALLEYS OF THE HILLS HE SAID AND THEN LET ALL THE FOES OF GONDOR FLEE PUTTING IT TO HIS LIPS HE BLEW A BLAST AND THE ECHOES LEAPT FROM ROCK TO ROCK AND ALL THAT HEARD THAT VOICE IN RIVENDELL SPRANG TO THEIR FEET
SLOW SHOULD YOU BE TO WIND THAT HORN AGAIN BOROMIR SAID ELROND UNTIL YOU STAND ONCE MORE ON THE BORDERS OF YOUR LAND AND DIRE NEED IS ON YOU
MAYBE SAID BOROMIR BUT ALWAYS I HAVE LET MY HORN CRY AT SETTING FORTH AND THOUGH THEREAFTER WE MAY WALK IN THE SHADOWS I WILL NOT GO FORTH AS A THIEF IN THE NIGHT
GIMLI THE DWARF ALONE WORE OPENLY A SHORT SHIRT OF STEELRINGS FOR DWARVES MAKE LIGHT OF BURDENS AND IN HIS BELT WAS A BROADBLADED AXE LEGOLAS HAD A BOW AND A QUIVER AND AT HIS BELT A LONG WHITE KNIFE THE YOUNGER HOBBITS WORE THE SWORDS THAT THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE BARROW BUT FRODO TOOK ONLY STING AND HIS MAILCOAT AS BILBO WISHED REMAINED HIDDEN GANDALF BORE HIS STAFF BUT GIRT AT HIS SIDE WAS THE ELVENSWORD GLAMDRING THE MATE OF ORCRIST THAT LAY NOW UPON THE BREAST OF THORIN UNDER THE LONELY MOUNTAIN
ALL WERE WELL FURNISHED BY ELROND WITH THICK WARM CLOTHES AND THEY HAD JACKETS AND CLOAKS LINED WITH FUR SPARE FOOD AND CLOTHES AND BLANKETS AND OTHER NEEDS WERE LADEN ON A PONY NONE OTHER THAN THE POOR BEAST THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT FROM BREE
THE STAY IN RIVENDELL HAD WORKED A GREAT WONDER OF CHANGE ON HIM HE WAS GLOSSY AND SEEMED TO HAVE THE VIGOUR OF YOUTH IT WAS SAM WHO HAD INSISTED ON CHOOSING HIM DECLARING THAT BILL AS HE CALLED HIM WOULD PINE IF HE DID NOT COME
THAT ANIMAL CAN NEARLY TALK HE SAID AND WOULD TALK IF HE STAYED HERE MUCH LONGER HE GAVE ME A LOOK AS PLAIN AS MR PIPPIN COULD SPEAK IT IF YOU DONT LET ME GO WITH YOU SAM ILL FOLLOW ON MY OWN SO BILL WAS GOING AS THE BEAST OF BURDEN YET HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE COMPANY THAT DID NOT SEEM DEPRESSED
THEIR FAREWELLS HAD BEEN SAID IN THE GREAT HALL BY THE FIRE AND THEY WERE ONLY WAITING NOW FOR GANDALF WHO HAD NOT YET COME OUT OF THE HOUSE A GLEAM OF FIRELIGHT CAME FROM THE OPEN DOORS AND SOFT LIGHTS WERE GLOWING IN MANY WINDOWS BILBO HUDDLED IN A CLOAK STOOD SILENT ON THE DOORSTEP BESIDE FRODO ARAGORN SAT WITH HIS HEAD BOWED TO HIS KNEES ONLY ELROND KNEW FULLY WHAT THIS HOUR MEANT TO HIM THE OTHERS COULD BE SEEN AS GREY SHAPES IN THE DARKNESS
SAM WAS STANDING BY THE PONY SUCKING HIS TEETH AND STARING MOODILY INTO THE GLOOM WHERE THE RIVER ROARED STONILY BELOW HIS DESIRE FOR ADVENTURE WAS AT ITS LOWEST EBB
BILL MY LAD HE SAID YOU OUGHTNT TO HAVE TOOK UP WITH US YOU COULD HAVE STAYED HERE AND ET THE BEST HAY TILL THE NEW GRASS COMES BILL SWISHED HIS TAIL AND SAID NOTHING
SAM EASED THE PACK ON HIS SHOULDERS AND WENT OVER ANXIOUSLY IN HIS MIND ALL THE THINGS THAT HE HAD STOWED IN IT WONDERING IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN ANYTHING HIS CHIEF TREASURE HIS COOKING GEAR AND THE LITTLE BOX OF SALT THAT HE ALWAYS CARRIED AND REFILLED WHEN HE COULD A GOOD SUPPLY OF PIPEWEED BUT NOT NEAR ENOUGH ILL WARRANT FLINT AND TINDER WOOLLEN HOSE LINEN VARIOUS SMALL BELONGINGS OF HIS MASTERS THAT FRODO HAD FORGOTTEN AND SAM HAD STOWED TO BRING THEM OUT IN TRIUMPH WHEN THEY WERE CALLED FOR HE WENT THROUGH THEM ALL
ROPE HE MUTTERED NO ROPE AND ONLY LAST NIGHT YOU SAID TO YOURSELF SAM WHAT ABOUT A BIT OF ROPE YOULL WANT IT IF YOU HAVENT GOT IT WELL ILL WANT IT I CANT GET IT NOW
AT THAT MOMENT ELROND CAME OUT WITH GANDALF AND HE CALLED THE COMPANY TO HIM THIS IS MY LAST WORD HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE THE RINGBEARER IS SETTING OUT ON THE QUEST OF MOUNT DOOM ON HIM ALONE IS ANY CHARGE LAID NEITHER TO CAST AWAY THE RING NOR TO DELIVER IT TO ANY SERVANT OF THE ENEMY NOR INDEED TO LET ANY HANDLE IT SAVE MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY AND THE COUNCIL AND ONLY THEN IN GRAVEST NEED THE OTHERS GO WITH HIM AS FREE COMPANIONS TO HELP HIM ON HIS WAY YOU MAY TARRY OR COME BACK OR TURN ASIDE INTO OTHER PATHS AS CHANCE ALLOWS THE FURTHER YOU GO THE LESS EASY WILL IT BE TO WITHDRAW YET NO OATH OR BOND IS LAID ON YOU TO GO FURTHER THAN YOU WILL FOR YOU DO NOT YET KNOW THE STRENGTH OF YOUR HEARTS AND YOU CANNOT FORESEE WHAT EACH MAY MEET UPON THE ROAD
FAITHLESS IS HE THAT SAYS FAREWELL WHEN THE ROAD DARKENS SAID GIMLI
MAYBE SAID ELROND BUT LET HIM NOT VOW TO WALK IN THE DARK WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE NIGHTFALL
YET SWORN WORD MAY STRENGTHEN QUAKING HEART SAID GIMLI
OR BREAK IT SAID ELROND LOOK NOT TOO FAR AHEAD BUT GO NOW WITH GOOD HEARTS FAREWELL AND MAY THE BLESSING OF ELVES AND MEN AND ALL FREE FOLK GO WITH YOU MAY THE STARS SHINE UPON YOUR FACES
GOOD GOOD LUCK CRIED BILBO STUTTERING WITH THE COLD I DONT SUPPOSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP A DIARY FRODO MY LAD BUT I SHALL EXPECT A FULL ACCOUNT WHEN YOU GET BACK AND DONT BE TOO LONG FAREWELL
MANY OTHERS OF ELRONDS HOUSEHOLD STOOD IN THE SHADOWS AND WATCHED THEM GO BIDDING THEM FAREWELL WITH SOFT VOICES THERE WAS NO LAUGHTER AND NO SONG OR MUSIC AT LAST THEY TURNED AWAY AND FADED SILENTLY INTO THE DUSK
THEY CROSSED THE BRIDGE AND WOUND SLOWLY UP THE LONG STEEP PATHS THAT LED OUT OF THE CLOVEN VALE OF RIVENDELL AND THEY CAME AT LENGTH TO THE HIGH MOOR WHERE THE WIND HISSED THROUGH THE HEATHER THEN WITH ONE GLANCE AT THE LAST HOMELY HOUSE TWINKLING BELOW THEM THEY STRODE AWAY FAR INTO THE NIGHT
AT THE FORD OF BRUINEN THEY LEFT THE ROAD AND TURNING SOUTHWARDS WENT ON BY NARROW PATHS AMONG THE FOLDED LANDS THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO HOLD THIS COURSE WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS FOR MANY MILES AND DAYS THE COUNTRY WAS MUCH ROUGHER AND MORE BARREN THAN IN THE GREEN VALE OF THE GREAT RIVER IN WILDERLAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RANGE AND THEIR GOING WOULD BE SLOW BUT THEY HOPED IN THIS WAY TO ESCAPE THE NOTICE OF UNFRIENDLY EYES THE SPIES OF SAURON HAD HITHERTO SELDOM BEEN SEEN IN THIS EMPTY COUNTRY AND THE PATHS WERE LITTLE KNOWN EXCEPT TO THE PEOPLE OF RIVENDELL
GANDALF WALKED IN FRONT AND WITH HIM WENT ARAGORN WHO KNEW THIS LAND EVEN IN THE DARK THE OTHERS WERE IN FILE BEHIND AND LEGOLAS WHOSE EYES WERE KEEN WAS THE REARGUARD THE FIRST PART OF THEIR JOURNEY WAS HARD AND DREARY AND FRODO REMEMBERED LITTLE OF IT SAVE THE WIND FOR MANY SUNLESS DAYS AN ICY BLAST CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE EAST AND NO GARMENT SEEMED ABLE TO KEEP OUT ITS SEARCHING FINGERS THOUGH THE COMPANY WAS WELL CLAD THEY SELDOM FELT WARM EITHER MOVING OR AT REST THEY SLEPT UNEASILY DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IN SOME HOLLOW OF THE LAND OR HIDDEN UNDER THE TANGLED THORNBUSHES THAT GREW IN THICKETS IN MANY PLACES IN THE LATE AFTERNOON THEY WERE ROUSED BY THE WATCH AND TOOK THEIR CHIEF MEAL COLD AND CHEERLESS AS A RULE FOR THEY COULD SELDOM RISK THE LIGHTING OF A FIRE IN THE EVENING THEY WENT ON AGAIN ALWAYS AS NEARLY SOUTHWARD AS THEY COULD FIND A WAY
AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO THE HOBBITS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WALKED AND STUMBLED UNTIL THEY WERE WEARY THEY WERE CREEPING FORWARD LIKE SNAILS AND GETTING NOWHERE EACH DAY THE LAND LOOKED MUCH THE SAME AS IT HAD THE DAY BEFORE YET STEADILY THE MOUNTAINS WERE DRAWING NEARER SOUTH OF RIVENDELL THEY ROSE EVER HIGHER AND BENT WESTWARDS AND ABOUT THE FEET OF THE MAIN RANGE THERE WAS TUMBLED AN EVER WIDER LAND OF BLEAK HILLS AND DEEP VALLEYS FILLED WITH TURBULENT WATERS PATHS WERE FEW AND WINDING AND LED THEM OFTEN ONLY TO THE EDGE OF SOME SHEER FALL OR DOWN INTO TREACHEROUS SWAMPS
THEY HAD BEEN A FORTNIGHT ON THE WAY WHEN THE WEATHER CHANGED THE WIND SUDDENLY FELL AND THEN VEERED ROUND TO THE SOUTH THE SWIFTFLOWING CLOUDS LIFTED AND MELTED AWAY AND THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND BRIGHT THERE CAME A COLD CLEAR DAWN AT THE END OF A LONG STUMBLING NIGHTMARCH THE TRAVELLERS REACHED A LOW RIDGE CROWNED WITH ANCIENT HOLLYTREES WHOSE GREYGREEN TRUNKS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BUILT OUT OF THE VERY STONE OF THE HILLS THEIR DARK LEAVES SHONE AND THEIR BERRIES GLOWED RED IN THE LIGHT OF THE RISING SUN
AWAY IN THE SOUTH FRODO COULD SEE THE DIM SHAPES OF LOFTY MOUNTAINS THAT SEEMED NOW TO STAND ACROSS THE PATH THAT THE COMPANY WAS TAKING AT THE LEFT OF THIS HIGH RANGE ROSE THREE PEAKS THE TALLEST AND NEAREST STOOD UP LIKE A TOOTH TIPPED WITH SNOW ITS GREAT BARE NORTHERN PRECIPICE WAS STILL LARGELY IN THE SHADOW BUT WHERE THE SUNLIGHT SLANTED UPON IT IT GLOWED RED
GANDALF STOOD AT FRODOS SIDE AND LOOKED OUT UNDER HIS HAND WE HAVE DONE WELL HE SAID WE HAVE REACHED THE BORDERS OF THE COUNTRY THAT MEN CALL HOLLIN MANY ELVES LIVED HERE IN HAPPIER DAYS WHEN EREGION WAS ITS NAME FIVEANDFORTY LEAGUES AS THE CROW FLIES WE HAVE COME THOUGH MANY LONG MILES FURTHER OUR FEET HAVE WALKED THE LAND AND THE WEATHER WILL BE MILDER NOW BUT PERHAPS ALL THE MORE DANGEROUS
DANGEROUS OR NOT A REAL SUNRISE IS MIGHTY WELCOME SAID FRODO THROWING BACK HIS HOOD AND LETTING THE MORNING LIGHT FALL ON HIS FACE
BUT THE MOUNTAINS ARE AHEAD OF US SAID PIPPIN WE MUST HAVE TURNED EASTWARDS IN THE NIGHT
NO SAID GANDALF BUT YOU SEE FURTHER AHEAD IN THE CLEAR LIGHT BEYOND THOSE PEAKS THE RANGE BENDS ROUND SOUTHWEST THERE ARE MANY MAPS IN ELRONDS HOUSE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO LOOK AT THEM
YES I DID SOMETIMES SAID PIPPIN BUT I DONT REMEMBER THEM FRODO HAS A BETTER HEAD FOR THAT SORT OF THING
I NEED NO MAP SAID GIMLI WHO HAD COME UP WITH LEGOLAS AND WAS GAZING OUT BEFORE HIM WITH A STRANGE LIGHT IN HIS DEEP EYES THERE IS THE LAND WHERE OUR FATHERS WORKED OF OLD AND WE HAVE WROUGHT THE IMAGE OF THOSE MOUNTAINS INTO MANY WORKS OF METAL AND OF STONE AND INTO MANY SONGS AND TALES THEY STAND TALL IN OUR DREAMS BARAZ ZIRAK SHATHUR
ONLY ONCE BEFORE HAVE I SEEN THEM FROM AFAR IN WAKING LIFE BUT I KNOW THEM AND THEIR NAMES FOR UNDER THEM LIES KHAZADDUM THE DWARROWDELF THAT IS NOW CALLED THE BLACK PIT MORIA IN THE ELVISH TONGUE YONDER STANDS BARAZINBAR THE REDHORN CRUEL CARADHRAS AND BEYOND HIM ARE SILVERTINE AND CLOUDYHEAD CELEBDIL THE WHITE AND FANUIDHOL THE GREY THAT WE CALL ZIRAKZIGIL AND BUNDUSHATHUR
THERE THE MISTY MOUNTAINS DIVIDE AND BETWEEN THEIR ARMS LIES THE DEEPSHADOWED VALLEY WHICH WE CANNOT FORGET AZANULBIZAR THE DIMRILL DALE WHICH THE ELVES CALL NANDUHIRION
IT IS FOR THE DIMRILL DALE THAT WE ARE MAKING SAID GANDALF IF WE CLIMB THE PASS THAT IS CALLED THE REDHORN GATE UNDER THE FAR SIDE OF CARADHRAS WE SHALL COME DOWN BY THE DIMRILL STAIR INTO THE DEEP VALE OF THE DWARVES THERE LIES THE MIRRORMERE AND THERE THE RIVER SILVERLODE RISES IN ITS ICY SPRINGS
DARK IS THE WATER OF KHELEDZARAM SAID GIMLI AND COLD ARE THE SPRINGS OF KIBILNALA MY HEART TREMBLES AT THE THOUGHT THAT I MAY SEE THEM SOON
MAY YOU HAVE JOY OF THE SIGHT MY GOOD DWARF SAID GANDALF BUT WHATEVER YOU MAY DO WE AT LEAST CANNOT STAY IN THAT VALLEY WE MUST GO DOWN THE SILVERLODE INTO THE SECRET WOODS AND SO TO THE GREAT RIVER AND THEN 
HE PAUSED
YES AND WHERE THEN ASKED MERRY
TO THE END OF THE JOURNEY  IN THE END SAID GANDALF WE CANNOT LOOK TOO FAR AHEAD LET US BE GLAD THAT THE FIRST STAGE IS SAFELY OVER I THINK WE WILL REST HERE NOT ONLY TODAY BUT TONIGHT AS WELL THERE IS A WHOLESOME AIR ABOUT HOLLIN MUCH EVIL MUST BEFALL A COUNTRY BEFORE IT WHOLLY FORGETS THE ELVES IF ONCE THEY DWELT THERE
THAT IS TRUE SAID LEGOLAS BUT THE ELVES OF THIS LAND WERE OF A RACE STRANGE TO US OF THE SILVAN FOLK AND THE TREES AND THE GRASS DO NOT NOW REMEMBER THEM ONLY I HEAR THE STONES LAMENT THEM DEEP THEY DELVED US FAIR THEY WROUGHT US HIGH THEY BUILDED US BUT THEY ARE GONE THEY ARE GONE THEY SOUGHT THE HAVENS LONG AGO
THAT MORNING THEY LIT A FIRE IN A DEEP HOLLOW SHROUDED BY GREAT BUSHES OF HOLLY AND THEIR SUPPERBREAKFAST WAS MERRIER THAN IT HAD BEEN SINCE THEY SET OUT THEY DID NOT HURRY TO BED AFTERWARDS FOR THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE ALL THE NIGHT TO SLEEP IN AND THEY DID NOT MEAN TO GO ON AGAIN UNTIL THE EVENING OF THE NEXT DAY ONLY ARAGORN WAS SILENT AND RESTLESS AFTER A WHILE HE LEFT THE COMPANY AND WANDERED ON TO THE RIDGE THERE HE STOOD IN THE SHADOW OF A TREE LOOKING OUT SOUTHWARDS AND WESTWARDS WITH HIS HEAD POSED AS IF HE WAS LISTENING THEN HE RETURNED TO THE BRINK OF THE DELL AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE OTHERS LAUGHING AND TALKING
WHAT IS THE MATTER STRIDER MERRY CALLED UP WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR DO YOU MISS THE EAST WIND
NO INDEED HE ANSWERED BUT I MISS SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY OF HOLLIN IN MANY SEASONS NO FOLK DWELL HERE NOW BUT MANY OTHER CREATURES LIVE HERE AT ALL TIMES ESPECIALLY BIRDS YET NOW ALL THINGS BUT YOU ARE SILENT I CAN FEEL IT THERE IS NO SOUND FOR MILES ABOUT US AND YOUR VOICES SEEM TO MAKE THE GROUND ECHO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT
GANDALF LOOKED UP WITH SUDDEN INTEREST BUT WHAT DO YOU GUESS IS THE REASON HE ASKED IS THERE MORE IN IT THAN SURPRISE AT SEEING FOUR HOBBITS NOT TO MENTION THE REST OF US WHERE PEOPLE ARE SO SELDOM SEEN OR HEARD
I HOPE THAT IS IT ANSWERED ARAGORN BUT I HAVE A SENSE OF WATCHFULNESS AND OF FEAR THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD HERE BEFORE
THEN WE MUST BE MORE CAREFUL SAID GANDALF IF YOU BRING A RANGER WITH YOU IT IS WELL TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIM ESPECIALLY IF THE RANGER IS ARAGORN WE MUST STOP TALKING ALOUD REST QUIETLY AND SET THE WATCH
IT WAS SAMS TURN THAT DAY TO TAKE THE FIRST WATCH BUT ARAGORN JOINED HIM THE OTHERS FELL ASLEEP THEN THE SILENCE GREW UNTIL EVEN SAM FELT IT THE BREATHING OF THE SLEEPERS COULD BE PLAINLY HEARD THE SWISH OF THE PONYS TAIL AND THE OCCASIONAL MOVEMENTS OF HIS FEET BECAME LOUD NOISES SAM COULD HEAR HIS OWN JOINTS CREAKING IF HE STIRRED DEAD SILENCE WAS AROUND HIM AND OVER ALL HUNG A CLEAR BLUE SKY AS THE SUN RODE UP FROM THE EAST AWAY IN THE SOUTH A DARK PATCH APPEARED AND GREW AND DROVE NORTH LIKE FLYING SMOKE IN THE WIND
WHATS THAT STRIDER IT DONT LOOK LIKE A CLOUD SAID SAM IN A WHISPER TO ARAGORN HE MADE NO ANSWER HE WAS GAZING INTENTLY AT THE SKY BUT BEFORE LONG SAM COULD SEE FOR HIMSELF WHAT WAS APPROACHING FLOCKS OF BIRDS FLYING AT GREAT SPEED WERE WHEELING AND CIRCLING AND TRAVERSING ALL THE LAND AS IF THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING AND THEY WERE STEADILY DRAWING NEARER
LIE FLAT AND STILL HISSED ARAGORN PULLING SAM DOWN INTO THE SHADE OF A HOLLYBUSH FOR A WHOLE REGIMENT OF BIRDS HAD BROKEN AWAY SUDDENLY FROM THE MAIN HOST AND CAME FLYING LOW STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE RIDGE SAM THOUGHT THEY WERE A KIND OF CROW OF LARGE SIZE AS THEY PASSED OVERHEAD IN SO DENSE A THRONG THAT THEIR SHADOW FOLLOWED THEM DARKLY OVER THE GROUND BELOW ONE HARSH CROAK WAS HEARD
NOT UNTIL THEY HAD DWINDLED INTO THE DISTANCE NORTH AND WEST AND THE SKY WAS AGAIN CLEAR WOULD ARAGORN RISE THEN HE SPRANG UP AND WENT AND WAKENED GANDALF
REGIMENTS OF BLACK CROWS ARE FLYING OVER ALL THE LAND BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE GREYFLOOD HE SAID AND THEY HAVE PASSED OVER HOLLIN THEY ARE NOT NATIVES HERE THEY ARE CREBAIN OUT OF FANGORN AND DUNLAND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT POSSIBLY THERE IS SOME TROUBLE AWAY SOUTH FROM WHICH THEY ARE FLEEING BUT I THINK THEY ARE SPYING OUT THE LAND I HAVE ALSO GLIMPSED MANY HAWKS FLYING HIGH UP IN THE SKY I THINK WE OUGHT TO MOVE AGAIN THIS EVENING HOLLIN IS NO LONGER WHOLESOME FOR US IT IS BEING WATCHED
AND IN THAT CASE SO IS THE REDHORN GATE SAID GANDALF AND HOW WE CAN GET OVER THAT WITHOUT BEING SEEN I CANNOT IMAGINE BUT WE WILL THINK OF THAT WHEN WE MUST AS FOR MOVING AS SOON AS IT IS DARK I AM AFRAID THAT YOU ARE RIGHT
LUCKILY OUR FIRE MADE LITTLE SMOKE AND HAD BURNED LOW BEFORE THE CREBAIN CAME SAID ARAGORN IT MUST BE PUT OUT AND NOT LIT AGAIN
WELL IF THAT ISNT A PLAGUE AND A NUISANCE SAID PIPPIN THE NEWS NO FIRE AND A MOVE AGAIN BY NIGHT HAD BEEN BROKEN TO HIM AS SOON AS HE WOKE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON ALL BECAUSE OF A PACK OF CROWS I HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO A REAL GOOD MEAL TONIGHT SOMETHING HOT
WELL YOU CAN GO ON LOOKING FORWARD SAID GANDALF THERE MAY BE MANY UNEXPECTED FEASTS AHEAD FOR YOU FOR MYSELF I SHOULD LIKE A PIPE TO SMOKE IN COMFORT AND WARMER FEET HOWEVER WE ARE CERTAIN OF ONE THING AT ANY RATE IT WILL GET WARMER AS WE GET SOUTH
TOO WARM I SHOULDNT WONDER MUTTERED SAM TO FRODO BUT IM BEGINNING TO THINK ITS TIME WE GOT A SIGHT OF THAT FIERY MOUNTAIN AND SAW THE END OF THE ROAD SO TO SPEAK I THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THIS HERE REDHORN OR WHATEVER ITS NAME IS MIGHT BE IT TILL GIMLI SPOKE HIS PIECE A FAIR JAWCRACKER DWARFLANGUAGE MUST BE MAPS CONVEYED NOTHING TO SAMS MIND AND ALL DISTANCES IN THESE STRANGE LANDS SEEMED SO VAST THAT HE WAS QUITE OUT OF HIS RECKONING
ALL THAT DAY THE COMPANY REMAINED IN HIDING THE DARK BIRDS PASSED OVER NOW AND AGAIN BUT AS THE WESTERING SUN GREW RED THEY DISAPPEARED SOUTHWARDS AT DUSK THE COMPANY SET OUT AND TURNING NOW HALF EAST THEY STEERED THEIR COURSE TOWARDS CARADHRAS WHICH FAR AWAY STILL GLOWED FAINTLY RED IN THE LAST LIGHT OF THE VANISHED SUN ONE BY ONE WHITE STARS SPRANG FORTH AS THE SKY FADED
GUIDED BY ARAGORN THEY STRUCK A GOOD PATH IT LOOKED TO FRODO LIKE THE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT ROAD THAT HAD ONCE BEEN BROAD AND WELL PLANNED FROM HOLLIN TO THE MOUNTAINPASS THE MOON NOW AT THE FULL ROSE OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND CAST A PALE LIGHT IN WHICH THE SHADOWS OF STONES WERE BLACK MANY OF THEM LOOKED TO HAVE BEEN WORKED BY HANDS THOUGH NOW THEY LAY TUMBLED AND RUINOUS IN A BLEAK BARREN LAND
IT WAS THE COLD CHILL HOUR BEFORE THE FIRST STIR OF DAWN AND THE MOON WAS LOW FRODO LOOKED UP AT THE SKY SUDDENLY HE SAW OR FELT A SHADOW PASS OVER THE HIGH STARS AS IF FOR A MOMENT THEY FADED AND THEN FLASHED OUT AGAIN HE SHIVERED
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING PASS OVER HE WHISPERED TO GANDALF WHO WAS JUST AHEAD
NO BUT I FELT IT WHATEVER IT WAS HE ANSWERED IT MAY BE NOTHING ONLY A WISP OF THIN CLOUD
IT WAS MOVING FAST THEN MUTTERED ARAGORN AND NOT WITH THE WIND
NOTHING FURTHER HAPPENED THAT NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING DAWNED EVEN BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE BUT THE AIR WAS CHILL AGAIN ALREADY THE WIND WAS TURNING BACK TOWARDS THE EAST FOR TWO MORE NIGHTS THEY MARCHED ON CLIMBING STEADILY BUT EVER MORE SLOWLY AS THEIR ROAD WOUND UP INTO THE HILLS AND THE MOUNTAINS TOWERED UP NEARER AND NEARER ON THE THIRD MORNING CARADHRAS ROSE BEFORE THEM A MIGHTY PEAK TIPPED WITH SNOW LIKE SILVER BUT WITH SHEER NAKED SIDES DULL RED AS IF STAINED WITH BLOOD
THERE WAS A BLACK LOOK IN THE SKY AND THE SUN WAS WAN THE WIND HAD GONE NOW ROUND TO THE NORTHEAST GANDALF SNUFFED THE AIR AND LOOKED BACK
WINTER DEEPENS BEHIND US HE SAID QUIETLY TO ARAGORN THE HEIGHTS AWAY NORTH ARE WHITER THAN THEY WERE SNOW IS LYING FAR DOWN THEIR SHOULDERS TONIGHT WE SHALL BE ON OUR WAY HIGH UP TOWARDS THE REDHORN GATE WE MAY WELL BE SEEN BY WATCHERS ON THAT NARROW PATH AND WAYLAID BY SOME EVIL BUT THE WEATHER MAY PROVE A MORE DEADLY ENEMY THAN ANY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR COURSE NOW ARAGORN
FRODO OVERHEARD THESE WORDS AND UNDERSTOOD THAT GANDALF AND ARAGORN WERE CONTINUING SOME DEBATE THAT HAD BEGUN LONG BEFORE HE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY
I THINK NO GOOD OF OUR COURSE FROM BEGINNING TO END AS YOU KNOW WELL GANDALF ANSWERED ARAGORN AND PERILS KNOWN AND UNKNOWN WILL GROW AS WE GO ON BUT WE MUST GO ON AND IT IS NO GOOD OUR DELAYING THE PASSAGE OF THE MOUNTAINS FURTHER SOUTH THERE ARE NO PASSES TILL ONE COMES TO THE GAP OF ROHAN I DO NOT TRUST THAT WAY SINCE YOUR NEWS OF SARUMAN WHO KNOWS WHICH SIDE NOW THE MARSHALS OF THE HORSELORDS SERVE
WHO KNOWS INDEED SAID GANDALF BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY AND NOT BY THE PASS OF CARADHRAS THE DARK AND SECRET WAY THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN OF
BUT LET US NOT SPEAK OF IT AGAIN NOT YET SAY NOTHING TO THE OTHERS I BEG NOT UNTIL IT IS PLAIN THAT THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
WE MUST DECIDE BEFORE WE GO FURTHER ANSWERED GANDALF
THEN LET US WEIGH THE MATTER IN OUR MINDS WHILE THE OTHERS REST AND SLEEP SAID ARAGORN
IN THE LATE AFTERNOON WHILE THE OTHERS WERE FINISHING THEIR BREAKFAST GANDALF AND ARAGORN WENT ASIDE TOGETHER AND STOOD LOOKING AT CARADHRAS ITS SIDES WERE NOW DARK AND SULLEN AND ITS HEAD WAS IN GREY CLOUD FRODO WATCHED THEM WONDERING WHICH WAY THE DEBATE WOULD GO WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE COMPANY GANDALF SPOKE AND THEN HE KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO FACE THE WEATHER AND THE HIGH PASS HE WAS RELIEVED HE COULD NOT GUESS WHAT WAS THE OTHER DARK AND SECRET WAY BUT THE VERY MENTION OF IT HAD SEEMED TO FILL ARAGORN WITH DISMAY AND FRODO WAS GLAD THAT IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED
FROM SIGNS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY SAID GANDALF I FEAR THAT THE REDHORN GATE MAY BE WATCHED AND ALSO I HAVE DOUBTS OF THE WEATHER THAT IS COMING UP BEHIND SNOW MAY COME WE MUST GO WITH ALL THE SPEED THAT WE CAN EVEN SO IT WILL TAKE US MORE THAN TWO MARCHES BEFORE WE REACH THE TOP OF THE PASS DARK WILL COME EARLY THIS EVENING WE MUST LEAVE AS SOON AS YOU CAN GET READY
I WILL ADD A WORD OF ADVICE IF I MAY SAID BOROMIR I WAS BORN UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND KNOW SOMETHING OF JOURNEYS IN THE HIGH PLACES WE SHALL MEET BITTER COLD IF NO WORSE BEFORE WE COME DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WILL NOT HELP US TO KEEP SO SECRET THAT WE ARE FROZEN TO DEATH WHEN WE LEAVE HERE WHERE THERE ARE STILL A FEW TREES AND BUSHES EACH OF US SHOULD CARRY A FAGGOT OF WOOD AS LARGE AS HE CAN BEAR
AND BILL COULD TAKE A BIT MORE COULDNT YOU LAD SAID SAM THE PONY LOOKED AT HIM MOURNFULLY
VERY WELL SAID GANDALF BUT WE MUST NOT USE THE WOOD  NOT UNLESS IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN FIRE AND DEATH
THE COMPANY SET OUT AGAIN WITH GOOD SPEED AT FIRST BUT SOON THEIR WAY BECAME STEEP AND DIFFICULT THE TWISTING AND CLIMBING ROAD HAD IN MANY PLACES ALMOST DISAPPEARED AND WAS BLOCKED WITH MANY FALLEN STONES THE NIGHT GREW DEADLY DARK UNDER GREAT CLOUDS A BITTER WIND SWIRLED AMONG THE ROCKS BY MIDNIGHT THEY HAD CLIMBED TO THE KNEES OF THE GREAT MOUNTAINS THE NARROW PATH NOW WOUND UNDER A SHEER WALL OF CLIFFS TO THE LEFT ABOVE WHICH THE GRIM FLANKS OF CARADHRAS TOWERED UP INVISIBLE IN THE GLOOM ON THE RIGHT WAS A GULF OF DARKNESS WHERE THE LAND FELL SUDDENLY INTO A DEEP RAVINE

LABORIOUSLY THEY CLIMBED A SHARP SLOPE AND HALTED FOR A MOMENT AT THE TOP FRODO FELT A SOFT TOUCH ON HIS FACE HE PUT OUT HIS ARM AND SAW THE DIM WHITE FLAKES OF SNOW SETTLING ON HIS SLEEVE
THEY WENT ON BUT BEFORE LONG THE SNOW WAS FALLING FAST FILLING ALL THE AIR AND SWIRLING INTO FRODOS EYES THE DARK BENT SHAPES OF GANDALF AND ARAGORN ONLY A PACE OR TWO AHEAD COULD HARDLY BE SEEN
I DONT LIKE THIS AT ALL PANTED SAM JUST BEHIND SNOWS ALL RIGHT ON A FINE MORNING BUT I LIKE TO BE IN BED WHILE ITS FALLING I WISH THIS LOT WOULD GO OFF TO HOBBITON FOLK MIGHT WELCOME IT THERE EXCEPT ON THE HIGH MOORS OF THE NORTHFARTHING A HEAVY FALL WAS RARE IN THE SHIRE AND WAS REGARDED AS A PLEASANT EVENT AND A CHANCE FOR FUN NO LIVING HOBBIT SAVE BILBO COULD REMEMBER THE FELL WINTER OF 1311 WHEN THE WHITE WOLVES INVADED THE SHIRE OVER THE FROZEN BRANDYWINE
GANDALF HALTED SNOW WAS THICK ON HIS HOOD AND SHOULDERS IT WAS ALREADY ANKLEDEEP ABOUT HIS BOOTS
THIS IS WHAT I FEARED HE SAID WHAT DO YOU SAY NOW ARAGORN
THAT I FEARED IT TOO ARAGORN ANSWERED BUT LESS THAN OTHER THINGS I KNEW THE RISK OF SNOW THOUGH IT SELDOM FALLS HEAVILY SO FAR SOUTH SAVE HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS BUT WE ARE NOT HIGH YET WE ARE STILL FAR DOWN WHERE THE PATHS ARE USUALLY OPEN ALL THE WINTER
I WONDER IF THIS IS A CONTRIVANCE OF THE ENEMY SAID BOROMIR THEY SAY IN MY LAND THAT HE CAN GOVERN THE STORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW THAT STAND UPON THE BORDERS OF MORDOR HE HAS STRANGE POWERS AND MANY ALLIES
HIS ARM HAS GROWN LONG INDEED SAID GIMLI IF HE CAN DRAW SNOW DOWN FROM THE NORTH TO TROUBLE US HERE THREE HUNDRED LEAGUES AWAY
HIS ARM HAS GROWN LONG SAID GANDALF
WHILE THEY WERE HALTED THE WIND DIED DOWN AND THE SNOW SLACKENED UNTIL IT ALMOST CEASED THEY TRAMPED ON AGAIN BUT THEY HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN A FURLONG WHEN THE STORM RETURNED WITH FRESH FURY THE WIND WHISTLED AND THE SNOW BECAME A BLINDING BLIZZARD SOON EVEN BOROMIR FOUND IT HARD TO KEEP GOING THE HOBBITS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE TOILED ALONG BEHIND THE TALLER FOLK BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY COULD NOT GO MUCH FURTHER IF THE SNOW CONTINUED FRODOS FEET FELT LIKE LEAD PIPPIN WAS DRAGGING BEHIND EVEN GIMLI AS STOUT AS ANY DWARF COULD BE WAS GRUMBLING AS HE TRUDGED
THE COMPANY HALTED SUDDENLY AS IF THEY HAD COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITHOUT ANY WORDS BEING SPOKEN THEY HEARD EERIE NOISES IN THE DARKNESS ROUND THEM IT MAY HAVE BEEN ONLY A TRICK OF THE WIND IN THE CRACKS AND GULLIES OF THE ROCKY WALL BUT THE SOUNDS WERE THOSE OF SHRILL CRIES AND WILD HOWLS OF LAUGHTER STONES BEGAN TO FALL FROM THE MOUNTAINSIDE WHISTLING OVER THEIR HEADS OR CRASHING ON THE PATH BESIDE THEM EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THEY HEARD A DULL RUMBLE AS A GREAT BOULDER ROLLED DOWN FROM HIDDEN HEIGHTS ABOVE
WE CANNOT GO FURTHER TONIGHT SAID BOROMIR LET THOSE CALL IT THE WIND WHO WILL THERE ARE FELL VOICES ON THE AIR AND THESE STONES ARE AIMED AT US
I DO CALL IT THE WIND SAID ARAGORN BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE WHAT YOU SAY UNTRUE THERE ARE MANY EVIL AND UNFRIENDLY THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE LITTLE LOVE FOR THOSE THAT GO ON TWO LEGS AND YET ARE NOT IN LEAGUE WITH SAURON BUT HAVE PURPOSES OF THEIR OWN SOME HAVE BEEN IN THIS WORLD LONGER THAN HE
CARADHRAS WAS CALLED THE CRUEL AND HAD AN ILL NAME SAID GIMLI LONG YEARS AGO WHEN RUMOUR OF SAURON HAD NOT BEEN HEARD IN THESE LANDS
IT MATTERS LITTLE WHO IS THE ENEMY IF WE CANNOT BEAT OFF HIS ATTACK SAID GANDALF
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO CRIED PIPPIN MISERABLY HE WAS LEANING ON MERRY AND FRODO AND HE WAS SHIVERING
EITHER STOP WHERE WE ARE OR GO BACK SAID GANDALF IT IS NO GOOD GOING ON ONLY A LITTLE HIGHER IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY THIS PATH LEAVES THE CLIFF AND RUNS INTO A WIDE SHALLOW TROUGH AT THE BOTTOM OF A LONG HARD SLOPE WE SHOULD HAVE NO SHELTER THERE FROM SNOW OR STONES  OR ANYTHING ELSE
AND IT IS NO GOOD GOING BACK WHILE THE STORM HOLDS SAID ARAGORN WE HAVE PASSED NO PLACE ON THE WAY UP THAT OFFERED MORE SHELTER THAN THIS CLIFFWALL WE ARE UNDER NOW
SHELTER MUTTERED SAM IF THIS IS SHELTER THEN ONE WALL AND NO ROOF MAKE A HOUSE
THE COMPANY NOW GATHERED TOGETHER AS CLOSE TO THE CLIFF AS THEY COULD IT FACED SOUTHWARDS AND NEAR THE BOTTOM IT LEANED OUT A LITTLE SO THAT THEY HOPED IT WOULD GIVE THEM SOME PROTECTION FROM THE NORTHERLY WIND AND FROM THE FALLING STONES BUT EDDYING BLASTS SWIRLED ROUND THEM FROM EVERY SIDE AND THE SNOW FLOWED DOWN IN EVER DENSER CLOUDS
THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE WALL BILL THE PONY STOOD PATIENTLY BUT DEJECTEDLY IN FRONT OF THE HOBBITS AND SCREENED THEM A LITTLE BUT BEFORE LONG THE DRIFTING SNOW WAS ABOVE HIS HOCKS AND IT WENT ON MOUNTING IF THEY HAD HAD NO LARGER COMPANIONS THE HOBBITS WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY BURIED
A GREAT SLEEPINESS CAME OVER FRODO HE FELT HIMSELF SINKING FAST INTO A WARM AND HAZY DREAM HE THOUGHT A FIRE WAS HEATING HIS TOES AND OUT OF THE SHADOWS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEARTH HE HEARD BILBOS VOICE SPEAKING I DONT THINK MUCH OF YOUR DIARY HE SAID SNOWSTORMS ON JANUARY THE TWELFTH THERE WAS NO NEED TO COME BACK TO REPORT THAT
BUT I WANTED REST AND SLEEP BILBO FRODO ANSWERED WITH AN EFFORT WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF SHAKEN AND HE CAME BACK PAINFULLY TO WAKEFULNESS BOROMIR HAD LIFTED HIM OFF THE GROUND OUT OF A NEST OF SNOW
THIS WILL BE THE DEATH OF THE HALFLINGS GANDALF SAID BOROMIR IT IS USELESS TO SIT HERE UNTIL THE SNOW GOES OVER OUR HEADS WE MUST DO SOMETHING TO SAVE OURSELVES
GIVE THEM THIS SAID GANDALF SEARCHING IN HIS PACK AND DRAWING OUT A LEATHERN FLASK JUST A MOUTHFUL EACH  FOR ALL OF US IT IS VERY PRECIOUS IT IS MIRUVOR THE CORDIAL OF IMLADRIS ELROND GAVE IT TO ME AT OUR PARTING PASS IT ROUND
AS SOON AS FRODO HAD SWALLOWED A LITTLE OF THE WARM AND FRAGRANT LIQUOR HE FELT A NEW STRENGTH OF HEART AND THE HEAVY DROWSINESS LEFT HIS LIMBS THE OTHERS ALSO REVIVED AND FOUND FRESH HOPE AND VIGOUR BUT THE SNOW DID NOT RELENT IT WHIRLED ABOUT THEM THICKER THAN EVER AND THE WIND BLEW LOUDER
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO FIRE ASKED BOROMIR SUDDENLY THE CHOICE SEEMS NEAR NOW BETWEEN FIRE AND DEATH GANDALF DOUBTLESS WE SHALL BE HIDDEN FROM ALL UNFRIENDLY EYES WHEN THE SNOW HAS COVERED US BUT THAT WILL NOT HELP US
YOU MAY MAKE A FIRE IF YOU CAN ANSWERED GANDALF IF THERE ARE ANY WATCHERS THAT CAN ENDURE THIS STORM THEN THEY CAN SEE US FIRE OR NO BUT THOUGH THEY HAD BROUGHT WOOD AND KINDLINGS BY THE ADVICE OF BOROMIR IT PASSED THE SKILL OF ELF OR EVEN DWARF TO STRIKE A FLAME THAT WOULD HOLD AMID THE SWIRLING WIND OR CATCH IN THE WET FUEL AT LAST RELUCTANTLY GANDALF HIMSELF TOOK A HAND PICKING UP A FAGGOT HE HELD IT ALOFT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WITH A WORD OF COMMAND NAUR AN EDRAITH AMMEN HE THRUST THE END OF HIS STAFF INTO THE MIDST OF IT AT ONCE A GREAT SPOUT OF GREEN AND BLUE FLAME SPRANG OUT AND THE WOOD FLARED AND SPUTTERED
IF THERE ARE ANY TO SEE THEN I AT LEAST AM REVEALED TO THEM HE SAID I HAVE WRITTEN GANDALF IS HERE IN SIGNS THAT ALL CAN READ FROM RIVENDELL TO THE MOUTHS OF ANDUIN
BUT THE COMPANY CARED NO LONGER FOR WATCHERS OR UNFRIENDLY EYES THEIR HEARTS WERE REJOICED TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THE WOOD BURNED MERRILY AND THOUGH ALL ROUND IT THE SNOW HISSED AND POOLS OF SLUSH CREPT UNDER THEIR FEET THEY WARMED THEIR HANDS GLADLY AT THE BLAZE THERE THEY STOOD STOOPING IN A CIRCLE ROUND THE LITTLE DANCING AND BLOWING FLAMES A RED LIGHT WAS ON THEIR TIRED AND ANXIOUS FACES BEHIND THEM THE NIGHT WAS LIKE A BLACK WALL
BUT THE WOOD WAS BURNING FAST AND THE SNOW STILL FELL THE FIRE BURNED LOW AND THE LAST FAGGOT WAS THROWN ON
THE NIGHT IS GETTING OLD SAID ARAGORN THE DAWN IS NOT FAR OFF
IF ANY DAWN CAN PIERCE THESE CLOUDS SAID GIMLI
BOROMIR STEPPED OUT OF THE CIRCLE AND STARED UP INTO THE BLACKNESS THE SNOW IS GROWING LESS HE SAID AND THE WIND IS QUIETER
FRODO GAZED WEARILY AT THE FLAKES STILL FALLING OUT OF THE DARK TO BE REVEALED WHITE FOR A MOMENT IN THE LIGHT OF THE DYING FIRE BUT FOR A LONG TIME HE COULD SEE NO SIGN OF THEIR SLACKENING THEN SUDDENLY AS SLEEP WAS BEGINNING TO CREEP OVER HIM AGAIN HE WAS AWARE THAT THE WIND HAD INDEED FALLEN AND THE FLAKES WERE BECOMING LARGER AND FEWER VERY SLOWLY A DIM LIGHT BEGAN TO GROW AT LAST THE SNOW STOPPED ALTOGETHER
AS THE LIGHT GREW STRONGER IT SHOWED A SILENT SHROUDED WORLD BELOW THEIR REFUGE WERE WHITE HUMPS AND DOMES AND SHAPELESS DEEPS BENEATH WHICH THE PATH THAT THEY HAD TRODDEN WAS ALTOGETHER LOST BUT THE HEIGHTS ABOVE WERE HIDDEN IN GREAT CLOUDS STILL HEAVY WITH THE THREAT OF SNOW
GIMLI LOOKED UP AND SHOOK HIS HEAD CARADHRAS HAS NOT FORGIVEN US HE SAID HE HAS MORE SNOW YET TO FLING AT US IF WE GO ON THE SOONER WE GO BACK AND DOWN THE BETTER
TO THIS ALL AGREED BUT THEIR RETREAT WAS NOW DIFFICULT IT MIGHT WELL PROVE IMPOSSIBLE ONLY A FEW PACES FROM THE ASHES OF THEIR FIRE THE SNOW LAY MANY FEET DEEP HIGHER THAN THE HEADS OF THE HOBBITS IN PLACES IT HAD BEEN SCOOPED AND PILED BY THE WIND INTO GREAT DRIFTS AGAINST THE CLIFF
IF GANDALF WOULD GO BEFORE US WITH A BRIGHT FLAME HE MIGHT MELT A PATH FOR YOU SAID LEGOLAS THE STORM HAD TROUBLED HIM LITTLE AND HE ALONE OF THE COMPANY REMAINED STILL LIGHT OF HEART
IF ELVES COULD FLY OVER MOUNTAINS THEY MIGHT FETCH THE SUN TO SAVE US ANSWERED GANDALF BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK ON I CANNOT BURN SNOW
WELL SAID BOROMIR WHEN HEADS ARE AT A LOSS BODIES MUST SERVE AS WE SAY IN MY COUNTRY THE STRONGEST OF US MUST SEEK A WAY SEE THOUGH ALL IS NOW SNOWCLAD OUR PATH AS WE CAME UP TURNED ABOUT THAT SHOULDER OF ROCK DOWN YONDER IT WAS THERE THAT THE SNOW FIRST BEGAN TO BURDEN US IF WE COULD REACH THAT POINT MAYBE IT WOULD PROVE EASIER BEYOND IT IS NO MORE THAN A FURLONG OFF I GUESS
THEN LET US FORCE A PATH THITHER YOU AND I SAID ARAGORN
ARAGORN WAS THE TALLEST OF THE COMPANY BUT BOROMIR LITTLE LESS IN HEIGHT WAS BROADER AND HEAVIER IN BUILD HE LED THE WAY AND ARAGORN FOLLOWED HIM SLOWLY THEY MOVED OFF AND WERE SOON TOILING HEAVILY IN PLACES THE SNOW WAS BREASTHIGH AND OFTEN BOROMIR SEEMED TO BE SWIMMING OR BURROWING WITH HIS GREAT ARMS RATHER THAN WALKING
LEGOLAS WATCHED THEM FOR A WHILE WITH A SMILE UPON HIS LIPS AND THEN HE TURNED TO THE OTHERS THE STRONGEST MUST SEEK A WAY SAY YOU BUT I SAY LET A PLOUGHMAN PLOUGH BUT CHOOSE AN OTTER FOR SWIMMING AND FOR RUNNING LIGHT OVER GRASS AND LEAF OR OVER SNOW AN ELF
WITH THAT HE SPRANG FORTH NIMBLY AND THEN FRODO NOTICED AS IF FOR THE FIRST TIME THOUGH HE HAD LONG KNOWN IT THAT THE ELF HAD NO BOOTS BUT WORE ONLY LIGHT SHOES AS HE ALWAYS DID AND HIS FEET MADE LITTLE IMPRINT IN THE SNOW
FAREWELL HE SAID TO GANDALF I GO TO FIND THE SUN THEN SWIFT AS A RUNNER OVER FIRM SAND HE SHOT AWAY AND QUICKLY OVERTAKING THE TOILING MEN WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND HE PASSED THEM AND SPED INTO THE DISTANCE AND VANISHED ROUND THE ROCKY TURN
THE OTHERS WAITED HUDDLED TOGETHER WATCHING UNTIL BOROMIR AND ARAGORN DWINDLED INTO BLACK SPECKS IN THE WHITENESS AT LENGTH THEY TOO PASSED FROM SIGHT THE TIME DRAGGED ON THE CLOUDS LOWERED AND NOW A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW CAME CURLING DOWN AGAIN
AN HOUR MAYBE WENT BY THOUGH IT SEEMED FAR LONGER AND THEN AT LAST THEY SAW LEGOLAS COMING BACK AT THE SAME TIME BOROMIR AND ARAGORN REAPPEARED ROUND THE BEND FAR BEHIND HIM AND CAME LABOURING UP THE SLOPE
WELL CRIED LEGOLAS AS HE RAN UP I HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE SUN SHE IS WALKING IN THE BLUE FIELDS OF THE SOUTH AND A LITTLE WREATH OF SNOW ON THIS REDHORN HILLOCK TROUBLES HER NOT AT ALL BUT I HAVE BROUGHT BACK A GLEAM OF GOOD HOPE FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOOMED TO GO ON FEET THERE IS THE GREATEST WINDDRIFT OF ALL JUST BEYOND THE TURN AND THERE OUR STRONG MEN WERE ALMOST BURIED THEY DESPAIRED UNTIL I RETURNED AND TOLD THEM THAT THE DRIFT WAS LITTLE WIDER THAN A WALL AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THE SNOW SUDDENLY GROWS LESS WHILE FURTHER DOWN IT IS NO MORE THAN A WHITE COVERLET TO COOL A HOBBITS TOES
AH IT IS AS I SAID GROWLED GIMLI IT WAS NO ORDINARY STORM IT IS THE ILL WILL OF CARADHRAS HE DOES NOT LOVE ELVES AND DWARVES AND THAT DRIFT WAS LAID TO CUT OFF OUR ESCAPE
BUT HAPPILY YOUR CARADHRAS HAS FORGOTTEN THAT YOU HAVE MEN WITH YOU SAID BOROMIR WHO CAME UP AT THAT MOMENT AND DOUGHTY MEN TOO IF I MAY SAY IT THOUGH LESSER MEN WITH SPADES MIGHT HAVE SERVED YOU BETTER STILL WE HAVE THRUST A LANE THROUGH THE DRIFT AND FOR THAT ALL HERE MAY BE GRATEFUL WHO CANNOT RUN AS LIGHT AS ELVES
BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET DOWN THERE EVEN IF YOU HAVE CUT THROUGH THE DRIFT SAID PIPPIN VOICING THE THOUGHT OF ALL THE HOBBITS
HAVE HOPE SAID BOROMIR I AM WEARY BUT I STILL HAVE SOME STRENGTH LEFT AND ARAGORN TOO WE WILL BEAR THE LITTLE FOLK THE OTHERS NO DOUBT WILL MAKE SHIFT TO TREAD THE PATH BEHIND US COME MASTER PEREGRIN I WILL BEGIN WITH YOU
HE LIFTED UP THE HOBBIT CLING TO MY BACK I SHALL NEED MY ARMS HE SAID AND STRODE FORWARD ARAGORN WITH MERRY CAME BEHIND PIPPIN MARVELLED AT HIS STRENGTH SEEING THE PASSAGE THAT HE HAD ALREADY FORCED WITH NO OTHER TOOL THAN HIS GREAT LIMBS EVEN NOW BURDENED AS HE WAS HE WAS WIDENING THE TRACK FOR THOSE WHO FOLLOWED THRUSTING THE SNOW ASIDE AS HE WENT
THEY CAME AT LENGTH TO THE GREAT DRIFT IT WAS FLUNG ACROSS THE MOUNTAINPATH LIKE A SHEER AND SUDDEN WALL AND ITS CREST SHARP AS IF SHAPED WITH KNIVES REARED UP MORE THAN TWICE THE HEIGHT OF BOROMIR BUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE A PASSAGE HAD BEEN BEATEN RISING AND FALLING LIKE A BRIDGE ON THE FAR SIDE MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE SET DOWN AND THERE THEY WAITED WITH LEGOLAS FOR THE REST OF THE COMPANY TO ARRIVE
AFTER A WHILE BOROMIR RETURNED CARRYING SAM BEHIND IN THE NARROW BUT NOW WELLTRODDEN TRACK CAME GANDALF LEADING BILL WITH GIMLI PERCHED AMONG THE BAGGAGE LAST CAME ARAGORN CARRYING FRODO THEY PASSED THROUGH THE LANE BUT HARDLY HAD FRODO TOUCHED THE GROUND WHEN WITH A DEEP RUMBLE THERE ROLLED DOWN A FALL OF STONES AND SLITHERING SNOW THE SPRAY OF IT HALF BLINDED THE COMPANY AS THEY CROUCHED AGAINST THE CLIFF AND WHEN THE AIR CLEARED AGAIN THEY SAW THAT THE PATH WAS BLOCKED BEHIND THEM
ENOUGH ENOUGH CRIED GIMLI WE ARE DEPARTING AS QUICKLY AS WE MAY AND INDEED WITH THAT LAST STROKE THE MALICE OF THE MOUNTAIN SEEMED TO BE EXPENDED AS IF CARADHRAS WAS SATISFIED THAT THE INVADERS HAD BEEN BEATEN OFF AND WOULD NOT DARE TO RETURN THE THREAT OF SNOW LIFTED THE CLOUDS BEGAN TO BREAK AND THE LIGHT GREW BROADER
AS LEGOLAS HAD REPORTED THEY FOUND THAT THE SNOW BECAME STEADILY MORE SHALLOW AS THEY WENT DOWN SO THAT EVEN THE HOBBITS COULD TRUDGE ALONG SOON THEY ALL STOOD ONCE MORE ON THE FLAT SHELF AT THE HEAD OF THE STEEP SLOPE WHERE THEY HAD FELT THE FIRST FLAKES OF SNOW THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE MORNING WAS NOW FAR ADVANCED FROM THE HIGH PLACE THEY LOOKED BACK WESTWARDS OVER THE LOWER LANDS FAR AWAY IN THE TUMBLE OF COUNTRY THAT LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS THE DELL FROM WHICH THEY HAD STARTED TO CLIMB THE PASS
FRODOS LEGS ACHED HE WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE AND HUNGRY AND HIS HEAD WAS DIZZY AS HE THOUGHT OF THE LONG AND PAINFUL MARCH DOWNHILL BLACK SPECKS SWAM BEFORE HIS EYES HE RUBBED THEM BUT THE BLACK SPECKS REMAINED IN THE DISTANCE BELOW HIM BUT STILL HIGH ABOVE THE LOWER FOOTHILLS DARK DOTS WERE CIRCLING IN THE AIR
THE BIRDS AGAIN SAID ARAGORN POINTING DOWN
THAT CANNOT BE HELPED NOW SAID GANDALF WHETHER THEY ARE GOOD OR EVIL OR HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH US AT ALL WE MUST GO DOWN AT ONCE NOT EVEN ON THE KNEES OF CARADHRAS WILL WE WAIT FOR ANOTHER NIGHTFALL
A COLD WIND FLOWED DOWN BEHIND THEM AS THEY TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE REDHORN GATE AND STUMBLED WEARILY DOWN THE SLOPE CARADHRAS HAD DEFEATED THEM



CHAPTER 4
A JOURNEY IN THE DARK

IT WAS EVENING AND THE GREY LIGHT WAS AGAIN WANING FAST WHEN THEY HALTED FOR THE NIGHT THEY WERE VERY WEARY THE MOUNTAINS WERE VEILED IN DEEPENING DUSK AND THE WIND WAS COLD GANDALF SPARED THEM ONE MORE MOUTHFUL EACH OF THE MIRUVOR OF RIVENDELL WHEN THEY HAD EATEN SOME FOOD HE CALLED A COUNCIL
WE CANNOT OF COURSE GO ON AGAIN TONIGHT HE SAID THE ATTACK ON THE REDHORN GATE HAS TIRED US OUT AND WE MUST REST HERE FOR A WHILE
AND THEN WHERE ARE WE TO GO ASKED FRODO
WE STILL HAVE OUR JOURNEY AND OUR ERRAND BEFORE US ANSWERED GANDALF WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO ON OR TO RETURN TO RIVENDELL
PIPPINS FACE BRIGHTENED VISIBLY AT THE MERE MENTION OF RETURN TO RIVENDELL MERRY AND SAM LOOKED UP HOPEFULLY BUT ARAGORN AND BOROMIR MADE NO SIGN FRODO LOOKED TROUBLED
I WISH I WAS BACK THERE HE SAID BUT HOW CAN I RETURN WITHOUT SHAME  UNLESS THERE IS INDEED NO OTHER WAY AND WE ARE ALREADY DEFEATED
YOU ARE RIGHT FRODO SAID GANDALF TO GO BACK IS TO ADMIT DEFEAT AND FACE WORSE DEFEAT TO COME IF WE GO BACK NOW THEN THE RING MUST REMAIN THERE WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SET OUT AGAIN THEN SOONER OR LATER RIVENDELL WILL BE BESIEGED AND AFTER A BRIEF AND BITTER TIME IT WILL BE DESTROYED THE RINGWRAITHS ARE DEADLY ENEMIES BUT THEY ARE ONLY SHADOWS YET OF THE POWER AND TERROR THEY WOULD POSSESS IF THE RULING RING WAS ON THEIR MASTERS HAND AGAIN
THEN WE MUST GO ON IF THERE IS A WAY SAID FRODO WITH A SIGH SAM SANK BACK INTO GLOOM
THERE IS A WAY THAT WE MAY ATTEMPT SAID GANDALF I THOUGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN FIRST I CONSIDERED THIS JOURNEY THAT WE SHOULD TRY IT BUT IT IS NOT A PLEASANT WAY AND I HAVE NOT SPOKEN OF IT TO THE COMPANY BEFORE ARAGORN WAS AGAINST IT UNTIL THE PASS OVER THE MOUNTAINS HAD AT LEAST BEEN TRIED
IF IT IS A WORSE ROAD THAN THE REDHORN GATE THEN IT MUST BE EVIL INDEED SAID MERRY BUT YOU HAD BETTER TELL US ABOUT IT AND LET US KNOW THE WORST AT ONCE
THE ROAD THAT I SPEAK OF LEADS TO THE MINES OF MORIA SAID GANDALF ONLY GIMLI LIFTED UP HIS HEAD A SMOULDERING FIRE WAS IN HIS EYES ON ALL THE OTHERS A DREAD FELL AT THE MENTION OF THAT NAME EVEN TO THE HOBBITS IT WAS A LEGEND OF VAGUE FEAR
THE ROAD MAY LEAD TO MORIA BUT HOW CAN WE HOPE THAT IT WILL LEAD THROUGH MORIA SAID ARAGORN DARKLY
IT IS A NAME OF ILL OMEN SAID BOROMIR NOR DO I SEE THE NEED TO GO THERE IF WE CANNOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS LET US JOURNEY SOUTHWARDS UNTIL WE COME TO THE GAP OF ROHAN WHERE MEN ARE FRIENDLY TO MY PEOPLE TAKING THE ROAD THAT I FOLLOWED ON MY WAY HITHER OR WE MIGHT PASS BY AND CROSS THE ISEN INTO LANGSTRAND AND LEBENNIN AND SO COME TO GONDOR FROM THE REGIONS NIGH TO THE SEA
THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE YOU CAME NORTH BOROMIR ANSWERED GANDALF DID YOU NOT HEAR WHAT I TOLD YOU OF SARUMAN WITH HIM I MAY HAVE BUSINESS OF MY OWN ERE ALL IS OVER BUT THE RING MUST NOT COME NEAR ISENGARD IF THAT CAN BY ANY MEANS BE PREVENTED THE GAP OF ROHAN IS CLOSED TO US WHILE WE GO WITH THE BEARER
AS FOR THE LONGER ROAD WE CANNOT AFFORD THE TIME WE MIGHT SPEND A YEAR IN SUCH A JOURNEY AND WE SHOULD PASS THROUGH MANY LANDS THAT ARE EMPTY AND HARBOURLESS YET THEY WOULD NOT BE SAFE THE WATCHFUL EYES BOTH OF SARUMAN AND OF THE ENEMY ARE ON THEM WHEN YOU CAME NORTH BOROMIR YOU WERE IN THE ENEMYS EYES ONLY ONE STRAY WANDERER FROM THE SOUTH AND A MATTER OF SMALL CONCERN TO HIM HIS MIND WAS BUSY WITH THE PURSUIT OF THE RING BUT YOU RETURN NOW AS A MEMBER OF THE RINGS COMPANY AND YOU ARE IN PERIL AS LONG AS YOU REMAIN WITH US THE DANGER WILL INCREASE WITH EVERY LEAGUE THAT WE GO SOUTH UNDER THE NAKED SKY
SINCE OUR OPEN ATTEMPT ON THE MOUNTAINPASS OUR PLIGHT HAS BECOME MORE DESPERATE I FEAR I SEE NOW LITTLE HOPE IF WE DO NOT SOON VANISH FROM SIGHT FOR A WHILE AND COVER OUR TRAIL THEREFORE I ADVISE THAT WE SHOULD GO NEITHER OVER THE MOUNTAINS NOR ROUND THEM BUT UNDER THEM THAT IS A ROAD AT ANY RATE THAT THE ENEMY WILL LEAST EXPECT US TO TAKE
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE EXPECTS SAID BOROMIR HE MAY WATCH ALL ROADS LIKELY AND UNLIKELY IN THAT CASE TO ENTER MORIA WOULD BE TO WALK INTO A TRAP HARDLY BETTER THAN KNOCKING AT THE GATES OF THE DARK TOWER ITSELF THE NAME OF MORIA IS BLACK
YOU SPEAK OF WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHEN YOU LIKEN MORIA TO THE STRONGHOLD OF SAURON ANSWERED GANDALF I ALONE OF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN IN THE DUNGEONS OF THE DARK LORD AND ONLY IN HIS OLDER AND LESSER DWELLING IN DOL GULDUR THOSE WHO PASS THE GATES OF BARADDUR DO NOT RETURN BUT I WOULD NOT LEAD YOU INTO MORIA IF THERE WERE NO HOPE OF COMING OUT AGAIN IF THERE ARE ORCS THERE IT MAY PROVE ILL FOR US THAT IS TRUE BUT MOST OF THE ORCS OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS WERE SCATTERED OR DESTROYED IN THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES THE EAGLES REPORT THAT ORCS ARE GATHERING AGAIN FROM AFAR BUT THERE IS A HOPE THAT MORIA IS STILL FREE
THERE IS EVEN A CHANCE THAT DWARVES ARE THERE AND THAT IN SOME DEEP HALL OF HIS FATHERS BALIN SON OF FUNDIN MAY BE FOUND HOWEVER IT MAY PROVE ONE MUST TREAD THE PATH THAT NEED CHOOSES
I WILL TREAD THE PATH WITH YOU GANDALF SAID GIMLI I WILL GO AND LOOK ON THE HALLS OF DURIN WHATEVER MAY WAIT THERE  IF YOU CAN FIND THE DOORS THAT ARE SHUT
GOOD GIMLI SAID GANDALF YOU ENCOURAGE ME WE WILL SEEK THE HIDDEN DOORS TOGETHER AND WE WILL COME THROUGH IN THE RUINS OF THE DWARVES A DWARFS HEAD WILL BE LESS EASY TO BEWILDER THAN ELVES OR MEN OR HOBBITS YET IT WILL NOT BE THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN TO MORIA I SOUGHT THERE LONG FOR THRAIN SON OF THROR AFTER HE WAS LOST I PASSED THROUGH AND I CAME OUT AGAIN ALIVE
I TOO ONCE PASSED THE DIMRILL GATE SAID ARAGORN QUIETLY BUT THOUGH I ALSO CAME OUT AGAIN THE MEMORY IS VERY EVIL I DO NOT WISH TO ENTER MORIA A SECOND TIME
AND I DONT WISH TO ENTER IT EVEN ONCE SAID PIPPIN
NOR ME MUTTERED SAM
OF COURSE NOT SAID GANDALF WHO WOULD BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL FOLLOW ME IF I LEAD YOU THERE
I WILL SAID GIMLI EAGERLY
I WILL SAID ARAGORN HEAVILY YOU FOLLOWED MY LEAD ALMOST TO DISASTER IN THE SNOW AND HAVE SAID NO WORD OF BLAME I WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD NOW  IF THIS LAST WARNING DOES NOT MOVE YOU IT IS NOT OF THE RING NOR OF US OTHERS THAT I AM THINKING NOW BUT OF YOU GANDALF AND I SAY TO YOU IF YOU PASS THE DOORS OF MORIA BEWARE
I WILL NOT GO SAID BOROMIR NOT UNLESS THE VOTE OF THE WHOLE COMPANY IS AGAINST ME WHAT DO LEGOLAS AND THE LITTLE FOLK SAY THE RINGBEARERS VOICE SURELY SHOULD BE HEARD
I DO NOT WISH TO GO TO MORIA SAID LEGOLAS
THE HOBBITS SAID NOTHING SAM LOOKED AT FRODO AT LAST FRODO SPOKE I DO NOT WISH TO GO HE SAID BUT NEITHER DO I WISH TO REFUSE THE ADVICE OF GANDALF I BEG THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO VOTE UNTIL WE HAVE SLEPT ON IT GANDALF WILL GET VOTES EASIER IN THE LIGHT OF THE MORNING THAN IN THIS COLD GLOOM HOW THE WIND HOWLS
AT THESE WORDS ALL FELL INTO SILENT THOUGHT THEY HEARD THE WIND HISSING AMONG THE ROCKS AND TREES AND THERE WAS A HOWLING AND WAILING ROUND THEM IN THE EMPTY SPACES OF THE NIGHT
SUDDENLY ARAGORN LEAPT TO HIS FEET HOW THE WIND HOWLS HE CRIED IT IS HOWLING WITH WOLFVOICES THE WARGS HAVE COME WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS
NEED WE WAIT UNTIL MORNING THEN SAID GANDALF IT IS AS I SAID THE HUNT IS UP EVEN IF WE LIVE TO SEE THE DAWN WHO NOW WILL WISH TO JOURNEY SOUTH BY NIGHT WITH THE WILD WOLVES ON HIS TRAIL
HOW FAR IS MORIA ASKED BOROMIR
THERE WAS A DOOR SOUTHWEST OF CARADHRAS SOME FIFTEEN MILES AS THE CROW FLIES AND MAYBE TWENTY AS THE WOLF RUNS ANSWERED GANDALF GRIMLY
THEN LET US START AS SOON AS IT IS LIGHT TOMORROW IF WE CAN SAID BOROMIR THE WOLF THAT ONE HEARS IS WORSE THAN THE ORC THAT ONE FEARS
TRUE SAID ARAGORN LOOSENING HIS SWORD IN ITS SHEATH BUT WHERE THE WARG HOWLS THERE ALSO THE ORC PROWLS
I WISH I HAD TAKEN ELRONDS ADVICE MUTTERED PIPPIN TO SAM I AM NO GOOD AFTER ALL THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF THE BREED OF BANDOBRAS THE BULLROARER IN ME THESE HOWLS FREEZE MY BLOOD I DONT EVER REMEMBER FEELING SO WRETCHED
MY HEARTS RIGHT DOWN IN MY TOES MR PIPPIN SAID SAM BUT WE ARENT ETTEN YET AND THERE ARE SOME STOUT FOLK HERE WITH US WHATEVER MAY BE IN STORE FOR OLD GANDALF ILL WAGER IT ISNT A WOLFS BELLY
FOR THEIR DEFENCE IN THE NIGHT THE COMPANY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE SMALL HILL UNDER WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SHELTERING IT WAS CROWNED WITH A KNOT OF OLD AND TWISTED TREES ABOUT WHICH LAY A BROKEN CIRCLE OF BOULDER STONES IN THE MIDST OF THIS THEY LIT A FIRE FOR THERE WAS NO HOPE THAT DARKNESS AND SILENCE WOULD KEEP THEIR TRAIL FROM DISCOVERY BY THE HUNTING PACKS
ROUND THE FIRE THEY SAT AND THOSE THAT WERE NOT ON GUARD DOZED UNEASILY POOR BILL THE PONY TREMBLED AND SWEATED WHERE HE STOOD THE HOWLING OF THE WOLVES WAS NOW ALL ROUND THEM SOMETIMES NEARER AND SOMETIMES FURTHER OFF IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT MANY SHINING EYES WERE SEEN PEERING OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL SOME ADVANCED ALMOST TO THE RING OF STONES AT A GAP IN THE CIRCLE A GREAT DARK WOLFSHAPE COULD BE SEEN HALTED GAZING AT THEM A SHUDDERING HOWL BROKE FROM HIM AS IF HE WERE A CAPTAIN SUMMONING HIS PACK TO THE ASSAULT
GANDALF STOOD UP AND STRODE FORWARD HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT LISTEN HOUND OF SAURON HE CRIED GANDALF IS HERE FLY IF YOU VALUE YOUR FOUL SKIN I WILL SHRIVEL YOU FROM TAIL TO SNOUT IF YOU COME WITHIN THIS RING
THE WOLF SNARLED AND SPRANG TOWARDS THEM WITH A GREAT LEAP AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A SHARP TWANG LEGOLAS HAD LOOSED HIS BOW THERE WAS A HIDEOUS YELL AND THE LEAPING SHAPE THUDDED TO THE GROUND THE ELVISH ARROW HAD PIERCED ITS THROAT THE WATCHING EYES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED GANDALF AND ARAGORN STRODE FORWARD BUT THE HILL WAS DESERTED THE HUNTING PACKS HAD FLED ALL ABOUT THEM THE DARKNESS GREW SILENT AND NO CRY CAME ON THE SIGHING WIND
THE NIGHT WAS OLD AND WESTWARD THE WANING MOON WAS SETTING GLEAMING FITFULLY THROUGH THE BREAKING CLOUDS SUDDENLY FRODO STARTED FROM SLEEP WITHOUT WARNING A STORM OF HOWLS BROKE OUT FIERCE AND WILD ALL ABOUT THE CAMP A GREAT HOST OF WARGS HAD GATHERED SILENTLY AND WAS NOW ATTACKING THEM FROM EVERY SIDE AT ONCE
FLING FUEL ON THE FIRE CRIED GANDALF TO THE HOBBITS DRAW YOUR BLADES AND STAND BACK TO BACK
IN THE LEAPING LIGHT AS THE FRESH WOOD BLAZED UP FRODO SAW MANY GREY SHAPES SPRING OVER THE RING OF STONES MORE AND MORE FOLLOWED THROUGH THE THROAT OF ONE HUGE LEADER ARAGORN PASSED HIS SWORD WITH A THRUST WITH A GREAT SWEEP BOROMIR HEWED THE HEAD OFF ANOTHER BESIDE THEM GIMLI STOOD WITH HIS STOUT LEGS APART WIELDING HIS DWARFAXE THE BOW OF LEGOLAS WAS SINGING
IN THE WAVERING FIRELIGHT GANDALF SEEMED SUDDENLY TO GROW HE ROSE UP A GREAT MENACING SHAPE LIKE THE MONUMENT OF SOME ANCIENT KING OF STONE SET UPON A HILL STOOPING LIKE A CLOUD HE LIFTED A BURNING BRANCH AND STRODE TO MEET THE WOLVES THEY GAVE BACK BEFORE HIM HIGH IN THE AIR HE TOSSED THE BLAZING BRAND IT FLARED WITH A SUDDEN WHITE RADIANCE LIKE LIGHTNING AND HIS VOICE ROLLED LIKE THUNDER
NAUR AN EDRAITH AMMEN NAUR DAN I NGAURHOTH HE CRIED
THERE WAS A ROAR AND A CRACKLE AND THE TREE ABOVE HIM BURST INTO A LEAF AND BLOOM OF BLINDING FLAME THE FIRE LEAPT FROM TREETOP TO TREETOP THE WHOLE HILL WAS CROWNED WITH DAZZLING LIGHT THE SWORDS AND KNIVES OF THE DEFENDERS SHONE AND FLICKERED THE LAST ARROW OF LEGOLAS KINDLED IN THE AIR AS IT FLEW AND PLUNGED BURNING INTO THE HEART OF A GREAT WOLFCHIEFTAIN ALL THE OTHERS FLED
SLOWLY THE FIRE DIED TILL NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT FALLING ASH AND SPARKS A BITTER SMOKE CURLED ABOVE THE BURNED TREESTUMPS AND BLEW DARKLY FROM THE HILL AS THE FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN CAME DIMLY IN THE SKY THEIR ENEMIES WERE ROUTED AND DID NOT RETURN
WHAT DID I TELL YOU MR PIPPIN SAID SAM SHEATHING HIS SWORD WOLVES WONT GET HIM THAT WAS AN EYEOPENER AND NO MISTAKE NEARLY SINGED THE HAIR OFF MY HEAD
WHEN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE MORNING CAME NO SIGNS OF THE WOLVES WERE TO BE FOUND AND THEY LOOKED IN VAIN FOR THE BODIES OF THE DEAD NO TRACE OF THE FIGHT REMAINED BUT THE CHARRED TREES AND THE ARROWS OF LEGOLAS LYING ON THE HILLTOP ALL WERE UNDAMAGED SAVE ONE OF WHICH ONLY THE POINT WAS LEFT
IT IS AS I FEARED SAID GANDALF THESE WERE NO ORDINARY WOLVES HUNTING FOR FOOD IN THE WILDERNESS LET US EAT QUICKLY AND GO
THAT DAY THE WEATHER CHANGED AGAIN ALMOST AS IF IT WAS AT THE COMMAND OF SOME POWER THAT HAD NO LONGER ANY USE FOR SNOW SINCE THEY HAD RETREATED FROM THE PASS A POWER THAT WISHED NOW TO HAVE A CLEAR LIGHT IN WHICH THINGS THAT MOVED IN THE WILD COULD BE SEEN FROM FAR AWAY THE WIND HAD BEEN TURNING THROUGH NORTH TO NORTHWEST DURING THE NIGHT AND NOW IT FAILED THE CLOUDS VANISHED SOUTHWARDS AND THE SKY WAS OPENED HIGH AND BLUE AS THEY STOOD UPON THE HILLSIDE READY TO DEPART A PALE SUNLIGHT GLEAMED OVER THE MOUNTAINTOPS
WE MUST REACH THE DOORS BEFORE SUNSET SAID GANDALF OR I FEAR WE SHALL NOT REACH THEM AT ALL IT IS NOT FAR BUT OUR PATH MAY BE WINDING FOR HERE ARAGORN CANNOT GUIDE US HE HAS SELDOM WALKED IN THIS COUNTRY AND ONLY ONCE HAVE I BEEN UNDER THE WEST WALL OF MORIA AND THAT WAS LONG AGO
THERE IT LIES HE SAID POINTING AWAY SOUTHEASTWARDS TO WHERE THE MOUNTAINS SIDES FELL SHEER INTO THE SHADOWS AT THEIR FEET IN THE DISTANCE COULD BE DIMLY SEEN A LINE OF BARE CLIFFS AND IN THEIR MIDST TALLER THAN THE REST ONE GREAT GREY WALL WHEN WE LEFT THE PASS I LED YOU SOUTHWARDS AND NOT BACK TO OUR STARTING POINT AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IT IS WELL THAT I DID SO FOR NOW WE HAVE SEVERAL MILES LESS TO CROSS AND HASTE IS NEEDED LET US GO
I DO NOT KNOW WHICH TO HOPE SAID BOROMIR GRIMLY THAT GANDALF WILL FIND WHAT HE SEEKS OR THAT COMING TO THE CLIFF WE SHALL FIND THE GATES LOST FOR EVER ALL CHOICES SEEM ILL AND TO BE CAUGHT BETWEEN WOLVES AND THE WALL THE LIKELIEST CHANCE LEAD ON
GIMLI NOW WALKED AHEAD BY THE WIZARDS SIDE SO EAGER WAS HE TO COME TO MORIA TOGETHER THEY LED THE COMPANY BACK TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS THE ONLY ROAD OF OLD TO MORIA FROM THE WEST HAD LAIN ALONG THE COURSE OF A STREAM THE SIRANNON THAT RAN OUT FROM THE FEET OF THE CLIFFS NEAR WHERE THE DOORS HAD STOOD BUT EITHER GANDALF WAS ASTRAY OR ELSE THE LAND HAD CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS FOR HE DID NOT STRIKE THE STREAM WHERE HE LOOKED TO FIND IT ONLY A FEW MILES SOUTHWARDS FROM THEIR START
THE MORNING WAS PASSING TOWARDS NOON AND STILL THE COMPANY WANDERED AND SCRAMBLED IN A BARREN COUNTRY OF RED STONES NOWHERE COULD THEY SEE ANY GLEAM OF WATER OR HEAR ANY SOUND OF IT ALL WAS BLEAK AND DRY THEIR HEARTS SANK THEY SAW NO LIVING THING AND NOT A BIRD WAS IN THE SKY BUT WHAT THE NIGHT WOULD BRING IF IT CAUGHT THEM IN THAT LOST LAND NONE OF THEM CARED TO THINK
SUDDENLY GIMLI WHO HAD PRESSED ON AHEAD CALLED BACK TO THEM HE WAS STANDING ON A KNOLL AND POINTING TO THE RIGHT HURRYING UP THEY SAW BELOW THEM A DEEP AND NARROW CHANNEL IT WAS EMPTY AND SILENT AND HARDLY A TRICKLE OF WATER FLOWED AMONG THE BROWN AND REDSTAINED STONES OF ITS BED BUT ON THE NEAR SIDE THERE WAS A PATH MUCH BROKEN AND DECAYED THAT WOUND ITS WAY AMONG THE RUINED WALLS AND PAVINGSTONES OF AN ANCIENT HIGHROAD
AH HERE IT IS AT LAST SAID GANDALF THIS IS WHERE THE STREAM RAN SIRANNON THE GATESTREAM THEY USED TO CALL IT BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE WATER I CANNOT GUESS IT USED TO BE SWIFT AND NOISY COME WE MUST HURRY ON WE ARE LATE
THE COMPANY WERE FOOTSORE AND TIRED BUT THEY TRUDGED DOGGEDLY ALONG THE ROUGH AND WINDING TRACK FOR MANY MILES THE SUN TURNED FROM THE NOON AND BEGAN TO GO WEST AFTER A BRIEF HALT AND A HASTY MEAL THEY WENT ON AGAIN BEFORE THEM THE MOUNTAINS FROWNED BUT THEIR PATH LAY IN A DEEP TROUGH OF LAND AND THEY COULD SEE ONLY THE HIGHER SHOULDERS AND THE FAR EASTWARD PEAKS
AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO A SHARP BEND THERE THE ROAD WHICH HAD BEEN VEERING SOUTHWARDS BETWEEN THE BRINK OF THE CHANNEL AND A STEEP FALL OF THE LAND TO THE LEFT TURNED AND WENT DUE EAST AGAIN ROUNDING THE CORNER THEY SAW BEFORE THEM A LOW CLIFF SOME FIVE FATHOMS HIGH WITH A BROKEN AND JAGGED TOP OVER IT A TRICKLING WATER DRIPPED THROUGH A WIDE CLEFT THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CARVED OUT BY A FALL THAT HAD ONCE BEEN STRONG AND FULL
INDEED THINGS HAVE CHANGED SAID GANDALF BUT THERE IS NO MISTAKING THE PLACE THERE IS ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE STAIR FALLS IF I REMEMBER RIGHT THERE WAS A FLIGHT OF STEPS CUT IN THE ROCK AT THEIR SIDE BUT THE MAIN ROAD WOUND AWAY LEFT AND CLIMBED WITH SEVERAL LOOPS UP TO THE LEVEL GROUND AT THE TOP THERE USED TO BE A SHALLOW VALLEY BEYOND THE FALLS RIGHT UP TO THE WALLS OF MORIA AND THE SIRANNON FLOWED THROUGH IT WITH THE ROAD BESIDE IT LET US GO AND SEE WHAT THINGS ARE LIKE NOW
THEY FOUND THE STONE STEPS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND GIMLI SPRANG SWIFTLY UP THEM FOLLOWED BY GANDALF AND FRODO WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP THEY SAW THAT THEY COULD GO NO FURTHER THAT WAY AND THE REASON FOR THE DRYING UP OF THE GATESTREAM WAS REVEALED BEHIND THEM THE SINKING SUN FILLED THE COOL WESTERN SKY WITH GLIMMERING GOLD BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A DARK STILL LAKE NEITHER SKY NOR SUNSET WAS REFLECTED ON ITS SULLEN SURFACE THE SIRANNON HAD BEEN DAMMED AND HAD FILLED ALL THE VALLEY BEYOND THE OMINOUS WATER WERE REARED VAST CLIFFS THEIR STERN FACES PALLID IN THE FADING LIGHT FINAL AND IMPASSABLE NO SIGN OF GATE OR ENTRANCE NOT A FISSURE OR CRACK COULD FRODO SEE IN THE FROWNING STONE
THERE ARE THE WALLS OF MORIA SAID GANDALF POINTING ACROSS THE WATER AND THERE THE GATE STOOD ONCE UPON A TIME THE ELVEN DOOR AT THE END OF THE ROAD FROM HOLLIN BY WHICH WE HAVE COME BUT THIS WAY IS BLOCKED NONE OF THE COMPANY I GUESS WILL WISH TO SWIM THIS GLOOMY WATER AT THE END OF THE DAY IT HAS AN UNWHOLESOME LOOK
WE MUST FIND A WAY ROUND THE NORTHERN EDGE SAID GIMLI THE FIRST THING FOR THE COMPANY TO DO IS TO CLIMB UP BY THE MAIN PATH AND SEE WHERE THAT WILL LEAD US EVEN IF THERE WERE NO LAKE WE COULD NOT GET OUR BAGGAGEPONY UP THIS STAIR
BUT IN ANY CASE WE CANNOT TAKE THE POOR BEAST INTO THE MINES SAID GANDALF THE ROAD UNDER THE MOUNTAINS IS A DARK ROAD AND THERE ARE PLACES NARROW AND STEEP WHICH HE CANNOT TREAD EVEN IF WE CAN
POOR OLD BILL SAID FRODO I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT AND POOR SAM I WONDER WHAT HE WILL SAY
I AM SORRY SAID GANDALF POOR BILL HAS BEEN A USEFUL COMPANION AND IT GOES TO MY HEART TO TURN HIM ADRIFT NOW I WOULD HAVE TRAVELLED LIGHTER AND BROUGHT NO ANIMAL LEAST OF ALL THIS ONE THAT SAM IS FOND OF IF I HAD HAD MY WAY I FEARED ALL ALONG THAT WE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TAKE THIS ROAD
THE DAY WAS DRAWING TO ITS END AND COLD STARS WERE GLINTING IN THE SKY HIGH ABOVE THE SUNSET WHEN THE COMPANY WITH ALL THE SPEED THEY COULD CLIMBED UP THE SLOPES AND REACHED THE SIDE OF THE LAKE IN BREADTH IT LOOKED TO BE NO MORE THAN TWO OR THREE FURLONGS AT THE WIDEST POINT HOW FAR IT STRETCHED AWAY SOUTHWARD THEY COULD NOT SEE IN THE FAILING LIGHT BUT ITS NORTHERN END WAS NO MORE THAN HALF A MILE FROM WHERE THEY STOOD AND BETWEEN THE STONY RIDGES THAT ENCLOSED THE VALLEY AND THE WATERS EDGE THERE WAS A RIM OF OPEN GROUND THEY HURRIED FORWARD FOR THEY HAD STILL A MILE OR TWO TO GO BEFORE THEY COULD REACH THE POINT ON THE FAR SHORE THAT GANDALF WAS MAKING FOR AND THEN HE HAD STILL TO FIND THE DOORS
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE NORTHERNMOST CORNER OF THE LAKE THEY FOUND A NARROW CREEK THAT BARRED THEIR WAY IT WAS GREEN AND STAGNANT THRUST OUT LIKE A SLIMY ARM TOWARDS THE ENCLOSING HILLS GIMLI STRODE FORWARD UNDETERRED AND FOUND THAT THE WATER WAS SHALLOW NO MORE THAN ANKLEDEEP AT THE EDGE BEHIND HIM THEY WALKED IN FILE THREADING THEIR WAY WITH CARE FOR UNDER THE WEEDY POOLS WERE SLIDING AND GREASY STONES AND FOOTING WAS TREACHEROUS FRODO SHUDDERED WITH DISGUST AT THE TOUCH OF THE DARK UNCLEAN WATER ON HIS FEET
AS SAM THE LAST OF THE COMPANY LED BILL UP ON TO THE DRY GROUND ON THE FAR SIDE THERE CAME A SOFT SOUND A SWISH FOLLOWED BY A PLOP AS IF A FISH HAD DISTURBED THE STILL SURFACE OF THE WATER TURNING QUICKLY THEY SAW RIPPLES BLACKEDGED WITH SHADOW IN THE WANING LIGHT GREAT RINGS WERE WIDENING OUTWARDS FROM A POINT FAR OUT IN THE LAKE THERE WAS A BUBBLING NOISE AND THEN SILENCE THE DUSK DEEPENED AND THE LAST GLEAMS OF THE SUNSET WERE VEILED IN CLOUD
GANDALF NOW PRESSED ON AT A GREAT PACE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD THEY REACHED THE STRIP OF DRY LAND BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE CLIFFS IT WAS NARROW OFTEN HARDLY A DOZEN YARDS ACROSS AND ENCUMBERED WITH FALLEN ROCK AND STONES BUT THEY FOUND A WAY HUGGING THE CLIFF AND KEEPING AS FAR FROM THE DARK WATER AS THEY MIGHT A MILE SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE SHORE THEY CAME UPON HOLLY TREES STUMPS AND DEAD BOUGHS WERE ROTTING IN THE SHALLOWS THE REMAINS IT SEEMED OF OLD THICKETS OR OF A HEDGE THAT HAD ONCE LINED THE ROAD ACROSS THE DROWNED VALLEY BUT CLOSE UNDER THE CLIFF THERE STOOD STILL STRONG AND LIVING TWO TALL TREES LARGER THAN ANY TREES OF HOLLY THAT FRODO HAD EVER SEEN OR IMAGINED THEIR GREAT ROOTS SPREAD FROM THE WALL TO THE WATER UNDER THE LOOMING CLIFFS THEY HAD LOOKED LIKE MERE BUSHES WHEN SEEN FAR OFF FROM THE TOP OF THE STAIR BUT NOW THEY TOWERED OVERHEAD STIFF DARK AND SILENT THROWING DEEP NIGHTSHADOWS ABOUT THEIR FEET STANDING LIKE SENTINEL PILLARS AT THE END OF THE ROAD
WELL HERE WE ARE AT LAST SAID GANDALF HERE THE ELVENWAY FROM HOLLIN ENDED HOLLY WAS THE TOKEN OF THE PEOPLE OF THAT LAND AND THEY PLANTED IT HERE TO MARK THE END OF THEIR DOMAIN FOR THE WESTDOOR WAS MADE CHIEFLY FOR THEIR USE IN THEIR TRAFFIC WITH THE LORDS OF MORIA THOSE WERE HAPPIER DAYS WHEN THERE WAS STILL CLOSE FRIENDSHIP AT TIMES BETWEEN FOLK OF DIFFERENT RACE EVEN BETWEEN DWARVES AND ELVES
IT WAS NOT THE FAULT OF THE DWARVES THAT THE FRIENDSHIP WANED SAID GIMLI
I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT IT WAS THE FAULT OF THE ELVES SAID LEGOLAS
I HAVE HEARD BOTH SAID GANDALF AND I WILL NOT GIVE JUDGEMENT NOW BUT I BEG YOU TWO LEGOLAS AND GIMLI AT LEAST TO BE FRIENDS AND TO HELP ME I NEED YOU BOTH THE DOORS ARE SHUT AND HIDDEN AND THE SOONER WE FIND THEM THE BETTER NIGHT IS AT HAND
TURNING TO THE OTHERS HE SAID WHILE I AM SEARCHING WILL YOU EACH MAKE READY TO ENTER THE MINES FOR HERE I FEAR WE MUST SAY FAREWELL TO OUR GOOD BEAST OF BURDEN YOU MUST LAY ASIDE MUCH OF THE STUFF THAT WE BROUGHT AGAINST BITTER WEATHER YOU WILL NOT NEED IT INSIDE NOR I HOPE WHEN WE COME THROUGH AND JOURNEY ON DOWN INTO THE SOUTH INSTEAD EACH OF US MUST TAKE A SHARE OF WHAT THE PONY CARRIED ESPECIALLY THE FOOD AND THE WATERSKINS
BUT YOU CANT LEAVE POOR OLD BILL BEHIND IN THIS FORSAKEN PLACE MR GANDALF CRIED SAM ANGRY AND DISTRESSED I WONT HAVE IT AND THATS FLAT AFTER HE HAS COME SO FAR AND ALL
I AM SORRY SAM SAID THE WIZARD BUT WHEN THE DOOR OPENS I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DRAG YOUR BILL INSIDE INTO THE LONG DARK OF MORIA YOU WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BILL AND YOUR MASTER
HED FOLLOW MR FRODO INTO A DRAGONS DEN IF I LED HIM PROTESTED SAM ITD BE NOTHING SHORT OF MURDER TO TURN HIM LOOSE WITH ALL THESE WOLVES ABOUT
IT WILL BE SHORT OF MURDER I HOPE SAID GANDALF HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE PONYS HEAD AND SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE GO WITH WORDS OF GUARD AND GUIDING ON YOU HE SAID YOU ARE A WISE BEAST AND HAVE LEARNED MUCH IN RIVENDELL MAKE YOUR WAYS TO PLACES WHERE YOU CAN FIND GRASS AND SO COME IN TIME TO ELRONDS HOUSE OR WHEREVER YOU WISH TO GO
THERE SAM HE WILL HAVE QUITE AS MUCH CHANCE OF ESCAPING WOLVES AND GETTING HOME AS WE HAVE
SAM STOOD SULLENLY BY THE PONY AND RETURNED NO ANSWER BILL SEEMING TO UNDERSTAND WELL WHAT WAS GOING ON NUZZLED UP TO HIM PUTTING HIS NOSE TO SAMS EAR SAM BURST INTO TEARS AND FUMBLED WITH THE STRAPS UNLADING ALL THE PONYS PACKS AND THROWING THEM ON THE GROUND THE OTHERS SORTED OUT THE GOODS MAKING A PILE OF ALL THAT COULD BE LEFT BEHIND AND DIVIDING UP THE REST
WHEN THIS WAS DONE THEY TURNED TO WATCH GANDALF HE APPEARED TO HAVE DONE NOTHING HE WAS STANDING BETWEEN THE TWO TREES GAZING AT THE BLANK WALL OF THE CLIFF AS IF HE WOULD BORE A HOLE INTO IT WITH HIS EYES GIMLI WAS WANDERING ABOUT TAPPING THE STONE HERE AND THERE WITH HIS AXE LEGOLAS WAS PRESSED AGAINST THE ROCK AS IF LISTENING
WELL HERE WE ARE AND ALL READY SAID MERRY BUT WHERE ARE THE DOORS I CANT SEE ANY SIGN OF THEM
DWARFDOORS ARE NOT MADE TO BE SEEN WHEN SHUT SAID GIMLI THEY ARE INVISIBLE AND THEIR OWN MASTERS CANNOT FIND THEM OR OPEN THEM IF THEIR SECRET IS FORGOTTEN
BUT THIS DOOR WAS NOT MADE TO BE A SECRET KNOWN ONLY TO DWARVES SAID GANDALF COMING SUDDENLY TO LIFE AND TURNING ROUND UNLESS THINGS ARE ALTOGETHER CHANGED EYES THAT KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR MAY DISCOVER THE SIGNS
HE WALKED FORWARD TO THE WALL RIGHT BETWEEN THE SHADOW OF THE TREES THERE WAS A SMOOTH SPACE AND OVER THIS HE PASSED HIS HANDS TO AND FRO MUTTERING WORDS UNDER HIS BREATH THEN HE STEPPED BACK
LOOK HE SAID CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
THE MOON NOW SHONE UPON THE GREY FACE OF THE ROCK BUT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE FOR A WHILE THEN SLOWLY ON THE SURFACE WHERE THE WIZARDS HANDS HAD PASSED FAINT LINES APPEARED LIKE SLENDER VEINS OF SILVER RUNNING IN THE STONE AT FIRST THEY WERE NO MORE THAN PALE GOSSAMERTHREADS SO FINE THAT THEY ONLY TWINKLED FITFULLY WHERE THE MOON CAUGHT THEM BUT STEADILY THEY GREW BROADER AND CLEARER UNTIL THEIR DESIGN COULD BE GUESSED


AT THE TOP AS HIGH AS GANDALF COULD REACH WAS AN ARCH OF INTERLACING LETTERS IN AN ELVISH CHARACTER BELOW THOUGH THE THREADS WERE IN PLACES BLURRED OR BROKEN THE OUTLINE COULD BE SEEN OF AN ANVIL AND A HAMMER SURMOUNTED BY A CROWN WITH SEVEN STARS BENEATH THESE AGAIN WERE TWO TREES EACH BEARING CRESCENT MOONS MORE CLEARLY THAN ALL ELSE THERE SHONE FORTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOOR A SINGLE STAR WITH MANY RAYS
THERE ARE THE EMBLEMS OF DURIN CRIED GIMLI
AND THERE IS THE TREE OF THE HIGH ELVES SAID LEGOLAS
AND THE STAR OF THE HOUSE OF FEANOR SAID GANDALF THEY ARE WROUGHT OF ITHILDIN THAT MIRRORS ONLY STARLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT AND SLEEPS UNTIL IT IS TOUCHED BY ONE WHO SPEAKS WORDS NOW LONG FORGOTTEN IN MIDDLEEARTH IT IS LONG SINCE I HEARD THEM AND I THOUGHT DEEPLY BEFORE I COULD RECALL THEM TO MY MIND
WHAT DOES THE WRITING SAY ASKED FRODO WHO WAS TRYING TO DECIPHER THE INSCRIPTION ON THE ARCH I THOUGHT I KNEW THE ELFLETTERS BUT I CANNOT READ THESE
THE WORDS ARE IN THE ELVENTONGUE OF THE WEST OF MIDDLEEARTH IN THE ELDER DAYS ANSWERED GANDALF BUT THEY DO NOT SAY ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE TO US THEY SAY ONLY THE DOORS OF DURIN LORD OF MORIA SPEAK FRIEND AND ENTER AND UNDERNEATH SMALL AND FAINT IS WRITTEN I NARVI MADE THEM CELEBRIMBOR OF HOLLIN DREW THESE SIGNS 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY SPEAK FRIEND AND ENTER ASKED MERRY
THAT IS PLAIN ENOUGH SAID GIMLI IF YOU ARE A FRIEND SPEAK THE PASSWORD AND THE DOORS WILL OPEN AND YOU CAN ENTER
YES SAID GANDALF THESE DOORS ARE PROBABLY GOVERNED BY WORDS SOME DWARFGATES WILL OPEN ONLY AT SPECIAL TIMES OR FOR PARTICULAR PERSONS AND SOME HAVE LOCKS AND KEYS THAT ARE STILL NEEDED WHEN ALL NECESSARY TIMES AND WORDS ARE KNOWN THESE DOORS HAVE NO KEY IN THE DAYS OF DURIN THEY WERE NOT SECRET THEY USUALLY STOOD OPEN AND DOORWARDS SAT HERE BUT IF THEY WERE SHUT ANY WHO KNEW THE OPENING WORD COULD SPEAK IT AND PASS IN AT LEAST SO IT IS RECORDED IS IT NOT GIMLI
IT IS SAID THE DWARF BUT WHAT THE WORD WAS IS NOT REMEMBERED NARVI AND HIS CRAFT AND ALL HIS KINDRED HAVE VANISHED FROM THE EARTH
BUT DO NOT YOU KNOW THE WORD GANDALF ASKED BOROMIR IN SURPRISE
NO SAID THE WIZARD
THE OTHERS LOOKED DISMAYED ONLY ARAGORN WHO KNEW GANDALF WELL REMAINED SILENT AND UNMOVED
THEN WHAT WAS THE USE OF BRINGING US TO THIS ACCURSED SPOT CRIED BOROMIR GLANCING BACK WITH A SHUDDER AT THE DARK WATER YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD ONCE PASSED THROUGH THE MINES HOW COULD THAT BE IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ENTER
THE ANSWER TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION BOROMIR SAID THE WIZARD IS THAT I DO NOT KNOW THE WORD  YET BUT WE SHALL SOON SEE AND HE ADDED WITH A GLINT IN HIS EYES UNDER THEIR BRISTLING BROWS YOU MAY ASK WHAT IS THE USE OF MY DEEDS WHEN THEY ARE PROVED USELESS AS FOR YOUR OTHER QUESTION DO YOU DOUBT MY TALE OR HAVE YOU NO WITS LEFT I DID NOT ENTER THIS WAY I CAME FROM THE EAST
IF YOU WISH TO KNOW I WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE DOORS OPEN OUTWARDS FROM THE INSIDE YOU MAY THRUST THEM OPEN WITH YOUR HANDS FROM THE OUTSIDE NOTHING WILL MOVE THEM SAVE THE SPELL OF COMMAND THEY CANNOT BE FORCED INWARDS
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN ASKED PIPPIN UNDAUNTED BY THE WIZARDS BRISTLING BROWS
KNOCK ON THE DOORS WITH YOUR HEAD PEREGRIN TOOK SAID GANDALF BUT IF THAT DOES NOT SHATTER THEM AND I AM ALLOWED A LITTLE PEACE FROM FOOLISH QUESTIONS I WILL SEEK FOR THE OPENING WORDS
I ONCE KNEW EVERY SPELL IN ALL THE TONGUES OF ELVES OR MEN OR ORCS THAT WAS EVER USED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE I CAN STILL REMEMBER TEN SCORE OF THEM WITHOUT SEARCHING IN MY MIND BUT ONLY A FEW TRIALS I THINK WILL BE NEEDED AND I SHALL NOT HAVE TO CALL ON GIMLI FOR WORDS OF THE SECRET DWARFTONGUE THAT THEY TEACH TO NONE THE OPENING WORDS WERE ELVISH LIKE THE WRITING ON THE ARCH THAT SEEMS CERTAIN
HE STEPPED UP TO THE ROCK AGAIN AND LIGHTLY TOUCHED WITH HIS STAFF THE SILVER STAR IN THE MIDDLE BENEATH THE SIGN OF THE ANVIL
ANNON EDHELLEN EDRO HI AMMEN
FENNAS NOGOTHRIM LASTO BETH LAMMEN

HE SAID IN A COMMANDING VOICE THE SILVER LINES FADED BUT THE BLANK GREY STONE DID NOT STIR
MANY TIMES HE REPEATED THESE WORDS IN DIFFERENT ORDER OR VARIED THEM THEN HE TRIED OTHER SPELLS ONE AFTER ANOTHER SPEAKING NOW FASTER AND LOUDER NOW SOFT AND SLOW THEN HE SPOKE MANY SINGLE WORDS OF ELVISH SPEECH NOTHING HAPPENED THE CLIFF TOWERED INTO THE NIGHT THE COUNTLESS STARS WERE KINDLED THE WIND BLEW COLD AND THE DOORS STOOD FAST
AGAIN GANDALF APPROACHED THE WALL AND LIFTING UP HIS ARMS HE SPOKE IN TONES OF COMMAND AND RISING WRATH EDRO EDRO HE CRIED AND STRUCK THE ROCK WITH HIS STAFF OPEN OPEN HE SHOUTED AND FOLLOWED IT WITH THE SAME COMMAND IN EVERY LANGUAGE THAT HAD EVER BEEN SPOKEN IN THE WEST OF MIDDLEEARTH THEN HE THREW HIS STAFF ON THE GROUND AND SAT DOWN IN SILENCE
AT THAT MOMENT FROM FAR OFF THE WIND BORE TO THEIR LISTENING EARS THE HOWLING OF WOLVES BILL THE PONY STARTED IN FEAR AND SAM SPRANG TO HIS SIDE AND WHISPERED SOFTLY TO HIM
DO NOT LET HIM RUN AWAY SAID BOROMIR IT SEEMS THAT WE SHALL NEED HIM STILL IF THE WOLVES DO NOT FIND US HOW I HATE THIS FOUL POOL HE STOOPED AND PICKING UP A LARGE STONE HE CAST IT FAR INTO THE DARK WATER
THE STONE VANISHED WITH A SOFT SLAP BUT AT THE SAME INSTANT THERE WAS A SWISH AND A BUBBLE GREAT RIPPLING RINGS FORMED ON THE SURFACE OUT BEYOND WHERE THE STONE HAD FALLEN AND THEY MOVED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF
WHY DID YOU DO THAT BOROMIR SAID FRODO I HATE THIS PLACE TOO AND I AM AFRAID I DONT KNOW OF WHAT NOT OF WOLVES OR THE DARK BEHIND THE DOORS BUT OF SOMETHING ELSE I AM AFRAID OF THE POOL DONT DISTURB IT
L WISH WE COULD GET AWAY SAID MERRY
WHY DOESNT GANDALF DO SOMETHING QUICK SAID PIPPIN
GANDALF TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD BOWED EITHER IN DESPAIR OR IN ANXIOUS THOUGHT THE MOURNFUL HOWLING OF THE WOLVES WAS HEARD AGAIN THE RIPPLES ON THE WATER GREW AND CAME CLOSER SOME WERE ALREADY LAPPING ON THE SHORE
WITH A SUDDENNESS THAT STARTLED THEM ALL THE WIZARD SPRANG TO HIS FEET HE WAS LAUGHING I HAVE IT HE CRIED OF COURSE OF COURSE ABSURDLY SIMPLE LIKE MOST RIDDLES WHEN YOU SEE THE ANSWER
PICKING UP HIS STAFF HE STOOD BEFORE THE ROCK AND SAID IN A CLEAR VOICE MELLON
THE STAR SHONE OUT BRIEFLY AND FADED AGAIN THEN SILENTLY A GREAT DOORWAY WAS OUTLINED THOUGH NOT A CRACK OR JOINT HAD BEEN VISIBLE BEFORE SLOWLY IT DIVIDED IN THE MIDDLE AND SWUNG OUTWARDS INCH BY INCH UNTIL BOTH DOORS LAY BACK AGAINST THE WALL THROUGH THE OPENING A SHADOWY STAIR COULD BE SEEN CLIMBING STEEPLY UP BUT BEYOND THE LOWER STEPS THE DARKNESS WAS DEEPER THAN THE NIGHT THE COMPANY STARED IN WONDER

I WAS WRONG AFTER ALL SAID GANDALF AND GIMLI TOO MERRY OF ALL PEOPLE WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK THE OPENING WORD WAS INSCRIBED ON THE ARCHWAY ALL THE TIME THE TRANSLATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAY FRIEND AND ENTER I HAD ONLY TO SPEAK THE ELVISH WORD FOR FRIEND AND THE DOORS OPENED QUITE SIMPLE TOO SIMPLE FOR A LEARNED LOREMASTER IN THESE SUSPICIOUS DAYS THOSE WERE HAPPIER TIMES NOW LET US GO
HE STRODE FORWARD AND SET HIS FOOT ON THE LOWEST STEP BUT AT THAT MOMENT SEVERAL THINGS HAPPENED FRODO FELT SOMETHING SEIZE HIM BY THE ANKLE AND HE FELL WITH A CRY BILL THE PONY GAVE A WILD NEIGH OF FEAR AND TURNED TAIL AND DASHED AWAY ALONG THE LAKESIDE INTO THE DARKNESS SAM LEAPED AFTER HIM AND THEN HEARING FRODOS CRY HE RAN BACK AGAIN WEEPING AND CURSING THE OTHERS SWUNG ROUND AND SAW THE WATERS OF THE LAKE SEETHING AS IF A HOST OF SNAKES WERE SWIMMING UP FROM THE SOUTHERN END
OUT FROM THE WATER A LONG SINUOUS TENTACLE HAD CRAWLED IT WAS PALEGREEN AND LUMINOUS AND WET ITS FINGERED END HAD HOLD OF FRODOS FOOT AND WAS DRAGGING HIM INTO THE WATER SAM ON HIS KNEES WAS NOW SLASHING AT IT WITH A KNIFE
THE ARM LET GO OF FRODO AND SAM PULLED HIM AWAY CRYING OUT FOR HELP TWENTY OTHERS ARMS CAME RIPPLING OUT THE DARK WATER BOILED AND THERE WAS A HIDEOUS STENCH
INTO THE GATEWAY UP THE STAIRS QUICK SHOUTED GANDALF LEAPING BACK ROUSING THEM FROM THE HORROR THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ROOTED ALL BUT SAM TO THE GROUND WHERE THEY STOOD HE DROVE THEM FORWARD
THEY WERE JUST IN TIME SAM AND FRODO WERE ONLY A FEW STEPS UP AND GANDALF HAD JUST BEGUN TO CLIMB WHEN THE GROPING TENTACLES WRITHED ACROSS THE NARROW SHORE AND FINGERED THE CLIFFWALL AND THE DOORS ONE CAME WRIGGLING OVER THE THRESHOLD GLISTENING IN THE STARLIGHT GANDALF TURNED AND PAUSED IF HE WAS CONSIDERING WHAT WORD WOULD CLOSE THE GATE AGAIN FROM WITHIN THERE WAS NO NEED MANY COILING ARMS SEIZED THE DOORS ON EITHER SIDE AND WITH HORRIBLE STRENGTH SWUNG THEM ROUND WITH A SHATTERING ECHO THEY SLAMMED AND ALL LIGHT WAS LOST A NOISE OF RENDING AND CRASHING CAME DULLY THROUGH THE PONDEROUS STONE
SAM CLINGING TO FRODOS ARM COLLAPSED ON A STEP IN THE BLACK DARKNESS POOR OLD BILL HE SAID IN A CHOKING VOICE POOR OLD BILL WOLVES AND SNAKES BUT THE SNAKES WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM I HAD TO CHOOSE MR FRODO I HAD TO COME WITH YOU
THEY HEARD GANDALF GO BACK DOWN THE STEPS AND THRUST HIS STAFF AGAINST THE DOORS THERE WAS A QUIVER IN THE STONE AND THE STAIRS TREMBLED BUT THE DOORS DID NOT OPEN WELL WELL SAID THE WIZARD THE PASSAGE IS BLOCKED BEHIND US NOW AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY OUT  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS I FEAR FROM THE SOUNDS THAT BOULDERS HAVE BEEN PILED UP AND THE TREES UPROOTED AND THROWN ACROSS THE GATE I AM SORRY FOR THE TREES WERE BEAUTIFUL AND HAD STOOD SO LONG
I FELT THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS NEAR FROM THE MOMENT THAT MY FOOT FIRST TOUCHED THE WATER SAID FRODO WHAT WAS THE THING OR WERE THERE MANY OF THEM
I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED GANDALF BUT THE ARMS WERE ALL GUIDED BY ONE PURPOSE SOMETHING HAS CREPT OR HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF DARK WATERS UNDER THE MOUNTAINS THERE ARE OLDER AND FOULER THINGS THAN ORCS IN THE DEEP PLACES OF THE WORLD HE DID NOT SPEAK ALOUD HIS THOUGHT THAT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT DWELT IN THE LAKE IT HAD SEIZED ON FRODO FIRST AMONG ALL THE COMPANY
BOROMIR MUTTERED UNDER HIS BREATH BUT THE ECHOING STONE MAGNIFIED THE SOUND TO A HOARSE WHISPER THAT ALL COULD HEAR IN THE DEEP PLACES OF THE WORLD AND THITHER WE ARE GOING AGAINST MY WISH WHO WILL LEAD US NOW IN THIS DEADLY DARK
I WILL SAID GANDALF AND GIMLI SHALL WALK WITH ME FOLLOW MY STAFF
AS THE WIZARD PASSED ON AHEAD UP THE GREAT STEPS HE HELD HIS STAFF ALOFT AND FROM ITS TIP THERE CAME A FAINT RADIANCE THE WIDE STAIRWAY WAS SOUND AND UNDAMAGED TWO HUNDRED STEPS THEY COUNTED BROAD AND SHALLOW AND AT THE TOP THEY FOUND AN ARCHED PASSAGE WITH A LEVEL FLOOR LEADING ON INTO THE DARK
LET US SIT AND REST AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT HERE ON THE LANDING SINCE WE CANT FIND A DININGROOM SAID FRODO HE HAD BEGUN TO SHAKE OFF THE TERROR OF THE CLUTCHING ARM AND SUDDENLY HE FELT EXTREMELY HUNGRY
THE PROPOSAL WAS WELCOMED BY ALL AND THEY SAT DOWN ON THE UPPER STEPS DIM FIGURES IN THE GLOOM AFTER THEY HAD EATEN GANDALF GAVE THEM EACH A THIRD SIP OF THE MIRUVOR OF RIVENDELL
IT WILL NOT LAST MUCH LONGER I AM AFRAID HE SAID BUT I THINK WE NEED IT AFTER THAT HORROR AT THE GATE AND UNLESS WE HAVE GREAT LUCK WE SHALL NEED ALL THAT IS LEFT BEFORE WE SEE THE OTHER SIDE GO CAREFULLY WITH THE WATER TOO THERE ARE MANY STREAMS AND WELLS IN THE MINES BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED WE MAY NOT HAVE A CHANCE OF FILLING OUR SKINS AND BOTTLES TILL WE COME DOWN INTO DIMRILL DALE
HOW LONG IS THAT GOING TO TAKE US ASKED FRODO
I CANNOT SAY ANSWERED GANDALF IT DEPENDS ON MANY CHANCES BUT GOING STRAIGHT WITHOUT MISHAP OR LOSING OUR WAY WE SHALL TAKE THREE OR FOUR MARCHES I EXPECT IT CANNOT BE LESS THAN FORTY MILES FROM WESTDOOR TO EASTGATE IN A DIRECT LINE AND THE ROAD MAY WIND MUCH
AFTER ONLY A BRIEF REST THEY STARTED ON THEIR WAY AGAIN ALL WERE EAGER TO GET THE JOURNEY OVER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND WERE WILLING TIRED AS THEY WERE TO GO ON MARCHING STILL FOR SEVERAL HOURS GANDALF WALKED IN FRONT AS BEFORE IN HIS LEFT HAND HE HELD UP HIS GLIMMERING STAFF THE LIGHT OF WHICH JUST SHOWED THE GROUND BEFORE HIS FEET IN HIS RIGHT HE HELD HIS SWORD GLAMDRING BEHIND HIM CAME GIMLI HIS EYES GLINTING IN THE DIM LIGHT AS HE TURNED HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE BEHIND THE DWARF WALKED FRODO AND HE HAD DRAWN THE SHORT SWORD STING NO GLEAM CAME FROM THE BLADES OF STING OR OF GLAMDRING AND THAT WAS SOME COMFORT FOR BEING THE WORK OF ELVISH SMITHS IN THE ELDER DAYS THESE SWORDS SHONE WITH A COLD LIGHT IF ANY ORCS WERE NEAR AT HAND BEHIND FRODO WENT SAM AND AFTER HIM LEGOLAS AND THE YOUNG HOBBITS AND BOROMIR IN THE DARK AT THE REAR GRIM AND SILENT WALKED ARAGORN
THE PASSAGE TWISTED ROUND A FEW TURNS AND THEN BEGAN TO DESCEND IT WENT STEADILY DOWN FOR A LONG WHILE BEFORE IT BECAME LEVEL ONCE AGAIN THE AIR GREW HOT AND STIFLING BUT IT WAS NOT FOUL AND AT TIMES THEY FELT CURRENTS OF COOLER AIR UPON THEIR FACES ISSUING FROM HALFGUESSED OPENINGS IN THE WALLS THERE WERE MANY OF THESE IN THE PALE RAY OF THE WIZARDS STAFF FRODO CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF STAIRS AND ARCHES AND OF OTHER PASSAGES AND TUNNELS SLOPING UP OR RUNNING STEEPLY DOWN OR OPENING BLANKLY DARK ON EITHER SIDE IT WAS BEWILDERING BEYOND HOPE OF REMEMBERING
GIMLI AIDED GANDALF VERY LITTLE EXCEPT BY HIS STOUT COURAGE AT LEAST HE WAS NOT AS WERE MOST OF THE OTHERS TROUBLED BY THE MERE DARKNESS IN ITSELF OFTEN THE WIZARD CONSULTED HIM AT POINTS WHERE THE CHOICE OF WAY WAS DOUBTFUL BUT IT WAS ALWAYS GANDALF WHO HAD THE FINAL WORD THE MINES OF MORIA WERE VAST AND INTRICATE BEYOND THE IMAGINATION OF GIMLI GLOINS SON DWARF OF THE MOUNTAINRACE THOUGH HE WAS TO GANDALF THE FAROFF MEMORIES OF A JOURNEY LONG BEFORE WERE NOW OF LITTLE HELP BUT EVEN IN THE GLOOM AND DESPITE ALL WINDINGS OF THE ROAD HE KNEW WHITHER HE WISHED TO GO AND HE DID NOT FALTER AS LONG AS THERE WAS A PATH THAT LED TOWARDS HIS GOAL
DO NOT BE AFRAID SAID ARAGORN THERE WAS A PAUSE LONGER THAN USUAL AND GANDALF AND GIMLI WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER THE OTHERS WERE CROWDED BEHIND WAITING ANXIOUSLY DO NOT BE AFRAID I HAVE BEEN WITH HIM ON MANY A JOURNEY IF NEVER ON ONE SO DARK AND THERE ARE TALES OF RIVENDELL OF GREATER DEEDS OF HIS THAN ANY THAT I HAVE SEEN HE WILL NOT GO ASTRAY  IF THERE IS ANY PATH TO FIND HE HAS LED US IN HERE AGAINST OUR FEARS BUT HE WILL LEAD US OUT AGAIN AT WHATEVER COST TO HIMSELF HE IS SURER OF FINDING THE WAY HOME IN A BLIND NIGHT THAN THE CATS OF QUEEN BERUTHIEL
IT WAS WELL FOR THE COMPANY THAT THEY HAD SUCH A GUIDE THEY HAD NO FUEL NOR ANY MEANS OF MAKING TORCHES IN THE DESPERATE SCRAMBLE AT THE DOORS MANY THINGS HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND BUT WITHOUT ANY LIGHT THEY WOULD SOON HAVE COME TO GRIEF THERE WERE NOT ONLY MANY ROADS TO CHOOSE FROM THERE WERE ALSO IN MANY PLACES HOLES AND PITFALLS AND DARK WELLS BESIDE THE PATH IN WHICH THEIR PASSING FEET ECHOED THERE WERE FISSURES AND CHASMS IN THE WALLS AND FLOOR AND EVERY NOW AND THEN A CRACK WOULD OPEN RIGHT BEFORE THEIR FEET THE WIDEST WAS MORE THAN SEVEN FEET ACROSS AND IT WAS LONG BEFORE PIPPIN COULD SUMMON ENOUGH COURAGE TO LEAP OVER THE DREADFUL GAP THE NOISE OF CHURNING WATER CAME UP FROM FAR BELOW AS IF SOME GREAT MILLWHEEL WAS TURNING IN THE DEPTHS
ROPE MUTTERED SAM I KNEW ID WANT IT IF I HADNT GOT IT
AS THESE DANGERS BECAME MORE FREQUENT THEIR MARCH BECAME SLOWER ALREADY THEY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TRAMPING ON ON ENDLESSLY TO THE MOUNTAINS ROOTS THEY WERE MORE THAN WEARY AND YET THERE SEEMED NO COMFORT IN THE THOUGHT OF HALTING ANYWHERE FRODOS SPIRITS HAD RISEN FOR A WHILE AFTER HIS ESCAPE AND AFTER FOOD AND A DRAUGHT OF THE CORDIAL BUT NOW A DEEP UNEASINESS GROWING TO DREAD CREPT OVER HIM AGAIN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN HEALED IN RIVENDELL OF THE KNIFESTROKE THAT GRIM WOUND HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT EFFECT HIS SENSES WERE SHARPER AND MORE AWARE OF THINGS THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN ONE SIGN OF CHANGE THAT HE SOON HAD NOTICED WAS THAT HE COULD SEE MORE IN THE DARK THAN ANY OF HIS COMPANIONS SAVE PERHAPS GANDALF AND HE WAS IN ANY CASE THE BEARER OF THE RING IT HUNG UPON ITS CHAIN AGAINST HIS BREAST AND AT WHILES IT SEEMED A HEAVY WEIGHT HE FELT THE CERTAINTY OF EVIL AHEAD AND OF EVIL FOLLOWING BUT HE SAID NOTHING HE GRIPPED TIGHTER ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD AND WENT ON DOGGEDLY
THE COMPANY BEHIND HIM SPOKE SELDOM AND THEN ONLY IN HURRIED WHISPERS THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THE SOUND OF THEIR OWN FEET THE DULL STUMP OF GIMLIS DWARFBOOTS THE HEAVY TREAD OF BOROMIR THE LIGHT STEP OF LEGOLAS THE SOFT SCARCEHEARD PATTER OF HOBBITFEET AND IN THE REAR THE SLOW FIRM FOOTFALLS OF ARAGORN WITH HIS LONG STRIDE WHEN THEY HALTED FOR A MOMENT THEY HEARD NOTHING AT ALL UNLESS IT WERE OCCASIONALLY A FAINT TRICKLE AND DRIP OF UNSEEN WATER YET FRODO BEGAN TO HEAR OR TO IMAGINE THAT HE HEARD SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THE FAINT FALL OF SOFT BARE FEET IT WAS NEVER LOUD ENOUGH OR NEAR ENOUGH FOR HIM TO FEEL CERTAIN THAT HE HEARD IT BUT ONCE IT HAD STARTED IT NEVER STOPPED WHILE THE COMPANY WAS MOVING BUT IT WAS NOT AN ECHO FOR WHEN THEY HALTED IT PATTERED ON FOR A LITTLE ALL BY ITSELF AND THEN GREW STILL
IT WAS AFTER NIGHTFALL WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED THE MINES THEY HAD BEEN GOING FOR SEVERAL HOURS WITH ONLY BRIEF HALTS WHEN GANDALF CAME TO HIS FIRST SERIOUS CHECK BEFORE HIM STOOD A WIDE DARK ARCH OPENING INTO THREE PASSAGES ALL LED IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION EASTWARDS BUT THE LEFTHAND PASSAGE PLUNGED DOWN WHILE THE RIGHTHAND CLIMBED UP AND THE MIDDLE WAY SEEMED TO RUN ON SMOOTH AND LEVEL BUT VERY NARROW
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF THIS PLACE AT ALL SAID GANDALF STANDING UNCERTAINLY UNDER THE ARCH HE HELD UP HIS STAFF IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SOME MARKS OR INSCRIPTION THAT MIGHT HELP HIS CHOICE BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND WAS TO BE SEEN I AM TOO WEARY TO DECIDE HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AND I EXPECT THAT YOU ARE ALL AS WEARY AS I AM OR WEARIER WE HAD BETTER HALT HERE FOR WHAT IS LEFT OF THE NIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IN HERE IT IS EVER DARK BUT OUTSIDE THE LATE MOON IS RIDING WESTWARD AND THE MIDDLENIGHT HAS PASSED
POOR OLD BILL SAID SAM I WONDER WHERE HE IS I HOPE THOSE WOLVES HAVENT GOT HIM YET
TO THE LEFT OF THE GREAT ARCH THEY FOUND A STONE DOOR IT WAS HALF CLOSED BUT SWUNG BACK EASILY TO A GENTLE THRUST BEYOND THERE SEEMED TO LIE A WIDE CHAMBER CUT IN THE ROCK
STEADY STEADY CRIED GANDALF AS MERRY AND PIPPIN PUSHED FORWARD GLAD TO FIND A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD REST WITH AT LEAST MORE FEELING OF SHELTER THAN IN THE OPEN PASSAGE STEADY YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS INSIDE YET I WILL GO FIRST
HE WENT IN CAUTIOUSLY AND THE OTHERS FILED BEHIND THERE HE SAID POINTING WITH HIS STAFF TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR BEFORE HIS FEET THEY SAW A LARGE ROUND HOLE LIKE THE MOUTH OF A WELL BROKEN AND RUSTY CHAINS LAY AT THE EDGE AND TRAILED DOWN INTO THE BLACK PIT FRAGMENTS OF STONE LAY NEAR
ONE OF YOU MIGHT HAVE FALLEN IN AND STILL BE WONDERING WHEN YOU WERE GOING TO STRIKE THE BOTTOM SAID ARAGORN TO MERRY LET THE GUIDE GO FIRST WHILE YOU HAVE ONE
THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A GUARDROOM MADE FOR THE WATCHING OF THE THREE PASSAGES SAID GIMLI THAT HOLE WAS PLAINLY A WELL FOR THE GUARDS USE COVERED WITH A STONE LID BUT THE LID IS BROKEN AND WE MUST ALL TAKE CARE IN THE DARK
PIPPIN FELT CURIOUSLY ATTRACTED BY THE WELL WHILE THE OTHERS WERE UNROLLING BLANKETS AND MAKING BEDS AGAINST THE WALLS OF THE CHAMBER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR HE CREPT TO THE EDGE AND PEERED OVER A CHILL AIR SEEMED TO STRIKE HIS FACE RISING FROM INVISIBLE DEPTHS MOVED BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE HE GROPED FOR A LOOSE STONE AND LET IT DROP HE FELT HIS HEART BEAT MANY TIMES BEFORE THERE WAS ANY SOUND THEN FAR BELOW AS IF THE STONE HAD FALLEN INTO DEEP WATER IN SOME CAVERNOUS PLACE THERE CAME A PLUNK VERY DISTANT BUT MAGNIFIED AND REPEATED IN THE HOLLOW SHAFT
WHATS THAT CRIED GANDALF HE WAS RELIEVED WHEN PIPPIN CONFESSED WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT HE WAS ANGRY AND PIPPIN COULD SEE HIS EYE GLINTING FOOL OF A TOOK HE GROWLED THIS IS A SERIOUS JOURNEY NOT A HOBBIT WALKINGPARTY THROW YOURSELF IN NEXT TIME AND THEN YOU WILL BE NO FURTHER NUISANCE NOW BE QUIET
NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BUT THEN THERE CAME OUT OF THE DEPTHS FAINT KNOCKS TOMTAP TAPTOM THEY STOPPED AND WHEN THE ECHOES HAD DIED AWAY THEY WERE REPEATED TAPTOM TOMTAP TAPTAP TOM THEY SOUNDED DISQUIETINGLY LIKE SIGNALS OF SOME SORT BUT AFTER A WHILE THE KNOCKING DIED AWAY AND WAS NOT HEARD AGAIN
THAT WAS THE SOUND OF A HAMMER OR I HAVE NEVER HEARD ONE SAID GIMLI
YES SAID GANDALF AND I DO NOT LIKE IT IT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PEREGRINS FOOLISH STONE BUT PROBABLY SOMETHING HAS BEEN DISTURBED THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER LEFT QUIET PRAY DO NOTHING OF THE KIND AGAIN LET US HOPE WE SHALL GET SOME REST WITHOUT FURTHER TROUBLE YOU PIPPIN CAN GO ON THE FIRST WATCH AS A REWARD HE GROWLED AS HE ROLLED HIMSELF IN A BLANKET
PIPPIN SAT MISERABLY BY THE DOOR IN THE PITCH DARK BUT HE KEPT ON TURNING ROUND FEARING THAT SOME UNKNOWN THING WOULD CRAWL UP OUT OF THE WELL HE WISHED HE COULD COVER THE HOLE IF ONLY WITH A BLANKET BUT HE DARED NOT MOVE OR GO NEAR IT EVEN THOUGH GANDALF SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP
ACTUALLY GANDALF WAS AWAKE THOUGH LYING STILL AND SILENT HE WAS DEEP IN THOUGHT TRYING TO RECALL EVERY MEMORY OF HIS FORMER JOURNEY IN THE MINES AND CONSIDERING ANXIOUSLY THE NEXT COURSE THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A FALSE TURN NOW MIGHT BE DISASTROUS AFTER AN HOUR HE ROSE UP AND CAME OVER TO PIPPIN
GET INTO A CORNER AND HAVE A SLEEP MY LAD HE SAID IN A KINDLY TONE YOU WANT TO SLEEP I EXPECT I CANNOT GET A WINK SO I MAY AS WELL DO THE WATCHING
I KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME HE MUTTERED AS HE SAT DOWN BY THE DOOR I NEED SMOKE I HAVE NOT TASTED IT SINCE THE MORNING BEFORE THE SNOWSTORM
THE LAST THING THAT PIPPIN SAW AS SLEEP TOOK HIM WAS A DARK GLIMPSE OF THE OLD WIZARD HUDDLED ON THE FLOOR SHIELDING A GLOWING CHIP IN HIS GNARLED HANDS BETWEEN HIS KNEES THE FLICKER FOR A MOMENT SHOWED HIS SHARP NOSE AND THE PUFF OF SMOKE
IT WAS GANDALF WHO ROUSED THEM ALL FROM SLEEP HE HAD SAT AND WATCHED ALL ALONE FOR ABOUT SIX HOURS AND HAD LET THE OTHERS REST AND IN THE WATCHES I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND HE SAID I DO NOT LIKE THE FEEL OF THE MIDDLE WAY AND I DO NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF THE LEFTHAND WAY THERE IS FOUL AIR DOWN THERE OR I AM NO GUIDE I SHALL TAKE THE RIGHTHAND PASSAGE IT IS TIME WE BEGAN TO CLIMB UP AGAIN
FOR EIGHT DARK HOURS NOT COUNTING TWO BRIEF HALTS THEY MARCHED ON AND THEY MET NO DANGER AND HEARD NOTHING AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE FAINT GLEAM OF THE WIZARDS LIGHT BOBBING LIKE A WILLOTHEWISP IN FRONT OF THEM THE PASSAGE THEY HAD CHOSEN WOUND STEADILY UPWARDS AS FAR AS THEY COULD JUDGE IT WENT IN GREAT MOUNTING CURVES AND AS IT ROSE IT GREW LOFTIER AND WIDER THERE WERE NOW NO OPENINGS TO OTHER GALLERIES OR TUNNELS ON EITHER SIDE AND THE FLOOR WAS LEVEL AND SOUND WITHOUT PITS OR CRACKS EVIDENTLY THEY HAD STRUCK WHAT ONCE HAD BEEN AN IMPORTANT ROAD AND THEY WENT FORWARD QUICKER THAN THEY HAD DONE ON THEIR FIRST MARCH
IN THIS WAY THEY ADVANCED SOME FIFTEEN MILES MEASURED IN A DIRECT LINE EAST THOUGH THEY MUST HAVE ACTUALLY WALKED TWENTY MILES OR MORE AS THE ROAD CLIMBED UPWARDS FRODOS SPIRITS ROSE A LITTLE BUT HE STILL FELT OPPRESSED AND STILL AT TIMES HE HEARD OR THOUGHT HE HEARD AWAY BEHIND THE COMPANY AND BEYOND THE FALL AND PATTER OF THEIR FEET A FOLLOWING FOOTSTEP THAT WAS NOT AN ECHO
THEY HAD MARCHED AS FAR AS THE HOBBITS COULD ENDURE WITHOUT A REST AND ALL WERE THINKING OF A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SLEEP WHEN SUDDENLY THE WALLS TO RIGHT AND LEFT VANISHED THEY SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH SOME ARCHED DOORWAY INTO A BLACK AND EMPTY SPACE THERE WAS A GREAT DRAUGHT OF WARMER AIR BEHIND THEM AND BEFORE THEM THE DARKNESS WAS COLD ON THEIR FACES THEY HALTED AND CROWDED ANXIOUSLY TOGETHER
GANDALF SEEMED PLEASED I CHOSE THE RIGHT WAY HE SAID AT LAST WE ARE COMING TO THE HABITABLE PARTS AND I GUESS THAT WE ARE NOT FAR NOW FROM THE EASTERN SIDE BUT WE ARE HIGH UP A GOOD DEAL HIGHER THAN THE DIMRILL GATE UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN FROM THE FEELING OF THE AIR WE MUST BE IN A WIDE HALL I WILL NOW RISK A LITTLE REAL LIGHT
HE RAISED HIS STAFF AND FOR A BRIEF INSTANT THERE WAS BLAZE LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING GREAT SHADOWS SPRANG UP AND FLED AND FOR A SECOND THEY SAW A VAST ROOF FAR ABOVE THEIR HEADS UPHELD BY MANY MIGHTY PILLARS HEWN OF STONE BEFORE THEM AND ON EITHER SIDE STRETCHED A HUGE EMPTY HALL ITS BLACK WALLS POLISHED AND SMOOTH AS GLASS FLASHED AND GLITTERED THREE OTHER ENTRANCES THEY SAW DARK BLACK ARCHES ONE STRAIGHT BEFORE THEM EASTWARDS AND ONE ON EITHER SIDE THEN THE LIGHT WENT OUT
THAT IS ALL THAT I SHALL VENTURE ON FOR THE PRESENT SAID GANDALF THERE USED TO BE GREAT WINDOWS ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE AND SHAFTS LEADING OUT TO THE LIGHT IN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE MINES I THINK WE HAVE REACHED THEM NOW BUT IT IS NIGHT OUTSIDE AGAIN AND WE CANNOT TELL UNTIL MORNING IF I AM RIGHT TOMORROW WE MAY ACTUALLY SEE THE MORNING PEEPING IN BUT IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAD BETTER GO NO FURTHER LET US REST IF WE CAN THINGS HAVE GONE WELL SO FAR AND THE GREATER PART OF THE DARK ROAD IS OVER BUT WE ARE NOT THROUGH YET AND IT IS A LONG WAY DOWN TO THE GATES THAT OPEN ON THE WORLD
THE COMPANY SPENT THAT NIGHT IN THE GREAT CAVERNOUS HALL HUDDLED CLOSE TOGETHER IN A CORNER TO ESCAPE THE DRAUGHT THERE SEEMED TO BE A STEADY INFLOW OF CHILL AIR THROUGH THE EASTERN ARCHWAY ALL ABOUT THEM AS THEY LAY HUNG THE DARKNESS HOLLOW AND IMMENSE AND THEY WERE OPPRESSED BY THE LONELINESS AND VASTNESS OF THE DOLVEN HALLS AND ENDLESSLY BRANCHING STAIRS AND PASSAGES THE WILDEST IMAGININGS THAT DARK RUMOUR HAD EVER SUGGESTED TO THE HOBBITS FELL ALTOGETHER SHORT OF THE ACTUAL DREAD AND WONDER OF MORIA
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A MIGHTY CROWD OF DWARVES HERE AT ONE TIME SAID SAM AND EVERY ONE OF THEM BUSIER THAN BADGERS FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS TO MAKE ALL THIS AND MOST IN HARD ROCK TOO WHAT DID THEY DO IT ALL FOR THEY DIDNT LIVE IN THESE DARKSOME HOLES SURELY
THESE ARE NOT HOLES SAID GIMLI THIS IS THE GREAT REALM AND CITY OF THE DWARROWDELF AND OF OLD IT WAS NOT DARKSOME BUT FULL OF LIGHT AND SPLENDOUR AS IS STILL REMEMBERED IN OUR SONGS
HE ROSE AND STANDING IN THE DARK HE BEGAN TO CHANT IN A DEEP VOICE WHILE THE ECHOES RAN AWAY INTO THE ROOF
THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THE MOUNTAINS GREEN
NO STAIN YET ON THE MOON WAS SEEN
NO WORDS WERE LAID ON STREAM OR STONE
WHEN DURIN WOKE AND WALKED ALONE
HE NAMED THE NAMELESS HILLS AND DELLS
HE DRANK FROM YET UNTASTED WELLS
HE STOOPED AND LOOKED IN MIRRORMERE
AND SAW A CROWN OF STARS APPEAR
AS GEMS UPON A SILVER THREAD
ABOVE THE SHADOW OF HIS HEAD

THE WORLD WAS FAIR THE MOUNTAINS TALL
IN ELDER DAYS BEFORE THE FALL
OF MIGHTY KINGS IN NARGOTHROND
AND GONDOLIN WHO NOW BEYOND
THE WESTERN SEAS HAVE PASSED AWAY
THE WORLD WAS FAIR IN DURINS DAY

A KING HE WAS ON CARVEN THRONE
IN MANYPILLARED HALLS OF STONE
WITH GOLDEN ROOF AND SILVER FLOOR
AND RUNES OF POWER UPON THE DOOR
THE LIGHT OF SUN AND STAR AND MOON
IN SHINING LAMPS OF CRYSTAL HEWN
UNDIMMED BY CLOUD OR SHADE OF NIGHT
THERE SHONE FOR EVER FAIR AND BRIGHT

THERE HAMMER ON THE ANVIL SMOTE
THERE CHISEL CLOVE AND GRAVER WROTE
THERE FORGED WAS BLADE AND BOUND WAS HILT
THE DELVER MINED THE MASON BUILT
THERE BERYL PEARL AND OPAL PALE
AND METAL WROUGHT LIKE FISHES MAIL
BUCKLER AND CORSLET AXE AND SWORD
AND SHINING SPEARS WERE LAID IN HOARD

UNWEARIED THEN WERE DURINS FOLK
BENEATH THE MOUNTAINS MUSIC WOKE
THE HARPERS HARPED THE MINSTRELS SANG
AND AT THE GATES THE TRUMPETS RANG

THE WORLD IS GREY THE MOUNTAINS OLD
THE FORGES FIRE IS ASHENCOLD
NO HARP IS WRUNG NO HAMMER FALLS
THE DARKNESS DWELLS IN DURINS HALLS
THE SHADOW LIES UPON HIS TOMB
IN MORIA IN KHAZADDUM
BUT STILL THE SUNKEN STARS APPEAR
IN DARK AND WINDLESS MIRRORMERE
THERE LIES HIS CROWN IN WATER DEEP
TILL DURIN WAKES AGAIN FROM SLEEP

I LIKE THAT SAID SAM I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN IT IN MORIA IN KHAZADDUM BUT IT MAKES THE DARKNESS SEEM HEAVIER THINKING OF ALL THOSE LAMPS ARE THERE PILES OF JEWELS AND GOLD LYING ABOUT HERE STILL
GIMLI WAS SILENT HAVING SUNG HIS SONG HE WOULD SAY NO MORE
PILES OF JEWELS SAID GANDALF NO THE ORCS HAVE OFTEN PLUNDERED MORIA THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN THE UPPER HALLS AND SINCE THE DWARVES FLED NO ONE DARES TO SEEK THE SHAFTS AND TREASURIES DOWN IN THE DEEP PLACES THEY ARE DROWNED IN WATER  OR IN A SHADOW OF FEAR
THEN WHAT DO THE DWARVES WANT TO COME BACK FOR ASKED SAM
FOR MITHRIL ANSWERED GANDALF THE WEALTH OF MORIA WAS NOT IN GOLD AND JEWELS THE TOYS OF THE DWARVES NOR IN IRON THEIR SERVANT SUCH THINGS THEY FOUND HERE IT IS TRUE ESPECIALLY IRON BUT THEY DID NOT NEED TO DELVE FOR THEM ALL THINGS THAT THEY DESIRED THEY COULD OBTAIN IN TRAFFIC FOR HERE ALONE IN THE WORLD WAS FOUND MORIASILVER OR TRUESILVER AS SOME HAVE CALLED IT MITHRIL IS THE ELVISH NAME THE DWARVES HAVE A NAME WHICH THEY DO NOT TELL ITS WORTH WAS TEN TIMES THAT OF GOLD AND NOW IT IS BEYOND PRICE FOR LITTLE IS LEFT ABOVE GROUND AND EVEN THE ORCS DARE NOT DELVE HERE FOR IT THE LODES LEAD AWAY NORTH TOWARDS CARADHRAS AND DOWN TO DARKNESS THE DWARVES TELL NO TALE BUT EVEN AS MITHRIL WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR WEALTH SO ALSO IT WAS THEIR DESTRUCTION THEY DELVED TOO GREEDILY AND TOO DEEP AND DISTURBED THAT FROM WHICH THEY FLED DURINS BANE OF WHAT THEY BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE ORCS HAVE GATHERED NEARLY ALL AND GIVEN IT IN TRIBUTE TO SAURON WHO COVETS IT
MITHRIL ALL FOLK DESIRED IT IT COULD BE BEATEN LIKE COPPER AND POLISHED LIKE GLASS AND THE DWARVES COULD MAKE OF IT A METAL LIGHT AND YET HARDER THAN TEMPERED STEEL ITS BEAUTY WAS LIKE TO THAT OF COMMON SILVER BUT THE BEAUTY OF MITHRIL DID NOT TARNISH OR GROW DIM THE ELVES DEARLY LOVED IT AND AMONG MANY USES THEY MADE OF IT ITHILDIN STARMOON WHICH YOU SAW UPON THE DOORS BILBO HAD A CORSLET OF MITHRILRINGS THAT THORIN GAVE HIM I WONDER WHAT HAS BECOME OF IT GATHERING DUST STILL IN MICHEL DELVING MATHOMHOUSE I SUPPOSE
WHAT CRIED GIMLI STARTLED OUT OF HIS SILENCE A CORSLET OF MORIASILVER THAT WAS A KINGLY GIFT
YES SAID GANDALF I NEVER TOLD HIM BUT ITS WORTH WAS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE WHOLE SHIRE AND EVERYTHING IN IT
FRODO SAID NOTHING BUT HE PUT HIS HAND UNDER HIS TUNIC AND TOUCHED THE RINGS OF HIS MAILSHIRT HE FELT STAGGERED TO THINK THAT HE HAD BEEN WALKING ABOUT WITH THE PRICE OF THE SHIRE UNDER HIS JACKET HAD BILBO KNOWN HE FELT NO DOUBT THAT BILBO KNEW QUITE WELL IT WAS INDEED A KINGLY GIFT BUT NOW HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM THE DARK MINES TO RIVENDELL TO BILBO AND TO BAG END IN THE DAYS WHILE BILBO WAS STILL THERE HE WISHED WITH ALL HIS HEART THAT HE WAS BACK THERE AND IN THOSE DAYS MOWING THE LAWN OR POTTERING AMONG THE FLOWERS AND THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF MORIA OR MITHRIL  OR THE RING
A DEEP SILENCE FELL ONE BY ONE THE OTHERS FELL ASLEEP FRODO WAS ON GUARD AS IF IT WERE A BREATH THAT CAME IN THROUGH UNSEEN DOORS OUT OF DEEP PLACES DREAD CAME OVER HIM HIS HANDS WERE COLD AND HIS BROW DAMP HE LISTENED ALL HIS MIND WAS GIVEN TO LISTENING AND NOTHING ELSE FOR TWO SLOW HOURS BUT HE HEARD NO SOUND NOT EVEN THE IMAGINED ECHO OF A FOOTFALL
HIS WATCH WAS NEARLY OVER WHEN FAR OFF WHERE HE GUESSED THAT THE WESTERN ARCHWAY STOOD HE FANCIED THAT HE COULD SEE TWO PALE POINTS OF LIGHT ALMOST LIKE LUMINOUS EYES HE STARTED HIS HEAD HAD NODDED I MUST HAVE NEARLY FALLEN ASLEEP ON GUARD HE THOUGHT I WAS ON THE EDGE OF A DREAM HE STOOD UP AND RUBBED HIS EYES AND REMAINED STANDING PEERING INTO THE DARK UNTIL HE WAS RELIEVED BY LEGOLAS
WHEN HE LAY DOWN HE QUICKLY WENT TO SLEEP BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE DREAM WENT ON HE HEARD WHISPERS AND SAW THE TWO PALE POINTS OF LIGHT APPROACHING SLOWLY HE WOKE AND FOUND THAT THE OTHERS WERE SPEAKING SOFTLY NEAR HIM AND THAT A DIM LIGHT WAS FALLING ON HIS FACE HIGH UP ABOVE THE EASTERN ARCHWAY THROUGH A SHAFT NEAR THE ROOF CAME A LONG PALE GLEAM AND ACROSS THE HALL THROUGH THE NORTHERN ARCH LIGHT ALSO GLIMMERED FAINT AND DISTANTLY
FRODO SAT UP GOOD MORNING SAID GANDALF FOR MORNING IT IS AGAIN AT LAST I WAS RIGHT YOU SEE WE ARE HIGH UP ON THE EAST SIDE OF MORIA BEFORE TODAY IS OVER WE OUGHT TO FIND THE GREAT GATES AND SEE THE WATERS OF MIRRORMERE LYING IN THE DIMRILL DALE BEFORE US
I SHALL BE GLAD SAID GIMLI I HAVE LOOKED ON MORIA AND IT IS VERY GREAT BUT IT HAS BECOME DARK AND DREADFUL AND WE HAVE FOUND NO SIGN OF MY KINDRED I DOUBT NOW THAT BALIN EVER CAME HERE
AFTER THEY HAD BREAKFASTED GANDALF DECIDED TO GO ON AGAIN AT ONCE WE ARE TIRED BUT WE SHALL REST BETTER WHEN WE ARE OUTSIDE HE SAID I THINK THAT NONE OF US WILL WISH TO SPEND ANOTHER NIGHT IN MORIA
NO INDEED SAID BOROMIR WHICH WAY SHALL WE TAKE YONDER EASTWARD ARCH
MAYBE SAID GANDALF BUT I DO NOT KNOW YET EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE UNLESS I AM QUITE ASTRAY I GUESS THAT WE ARE ABOVE AND TO THE NORTH OF THE GREAT GATES AND IT MAY NOT BE EASY TO FIND THE RIGHT ROAD DOWN TO THEM THE EASTERN ARCH WILL PROBABLY PROVE TO BE THE WAY THAT WE MUST TAKE BUT BEFORE WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS WE OUGHT TO LOOK ABOUT US LET US GO TOWARDS THAT LIGHT IN THE NORTH DOOR IF WE COULD FIND A WINDOW IT WOULD HELP BUT I FEAR THAT THE LIGHT COMES ONLY DOWN DEEP SHAFTS
FOLLOWING HIS LEAD THE COMPANY PASSED UNDER THE NORTHERN ARCH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A WIDE CORRIDOR AS THEY WENT ALONG IT THE GLIMMER GREW STRONGER AND THEY SAW THAT IT CAME THROUGH A DOORWAY ON THEIR RIGHT IT WAS HIGH AND FLATTOPPED AND THE STONE DOOR WAS STILL UPON ITS HINGES STANDING HALF OPEN BEYOND IT WAS A LARGE SQUARE CHAMBER IT WAS DIMLY LIT BUT TO THEIR EYES AFTER SO LONG A TIME IN THE DARK IT SEEMED DAZZLINGLY BRIGHT AND THEY BLINKED AS THEY ENTERED

THEIR FEET DISTURBED A DEEP DUST UPON THE FLOOR AND STUMBLED AMONG THINGS LYING IN THE DOORWAY WHOSE SHAPES THEY COULD NOT AT FIRST MAKE OUT THE CHAMBER WAS LIT BY A WIDE SHAFT HIGH IN THE FURTHER EASTERN WALL IT SLANTED UPWARDS AND FAR ABOVE A SMALL SQUARE PATCH OF BLUE SKY COULD BE SEEN THE LIGHT OF THE SHAFT FELL DIRECTLY ON A TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM A SINGLE OBLONG BLOCK ABOUT TWO FEET HIGH UPON WHICH WAS LAID A GREAT SLAB OF WHITE STONE
IT LOOKS LIKE A TOMB MUTTERED FRODO AND BENT FORWARDS WITH A CURIOUS SENSE OF FOREBODING TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT IT GANDALF CAME QUICKLY TO HIS SIDE ON THE SLAB RUNES WERE DEEPLY GRAVEN
THESE ARE DAERONS RUNES SUCH AS WERE USED OF OLD IN MORIA SAID GANDALF HERE IS WRITTEN IN THE TONGUES OF MEN AND DWARVES
BALINSON OFFUNDIN LORDOF MORIA
HE IS DEAD THEN SAID FRODO I FEARED IT WAS SO GIMLI CAST HIS HOOD OVER HIS FACE



CHAPTER 5
THE BRIDGE OF KHAZADDUM

THE COMPANY OF THE RING STOOD SILENT BESIDE THE TOMB OF BALIN FRODO THOUGHT OF BILBO AND HIS LONG FRIENDSHIP WITH THE DWARF AND OF BALINS VISIT TO THE SHIRE LONG AGO IN THAT DUSTY CHAMBER IN THE MOUNTAINS IT SEEMED A THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD
AT LENGTH THEY STIRRED AND LOOKED UP AND BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD GIVE THEM TIDINGS OF BALINS FATE OR SHOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS FOLK THERE WAS ANOTHER SMALLER DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBER UNDER THE SHAFT BY BOTH THE DOORS THEY COULD NOW SEE THAT MANY BONES WERE LYING AND AMONG THEM WERE BROKEN SWORDS AND AXEHEADS AND CLOVEN SHIELDS AND HELMS SOME OF THE SWORDS WERE CROOKED ORCSCIMITARS WITH BLACKENED BLADES
THERE WERE MANY RECESSES CUT IN THE ROCK OF THE WALLS AND IN THEM WERE LARGE IRONBOUND CHESTS OF WOOD ALL HAD BEEN BROKEN AND PLUNDERED BUT BESIDE THE SHATTERED LID OF ONE THERE LAY THE REMAINS OF A BOOK IT HAD BEEN SLASHED AND STABBED AND PARTLY BURNED AND IT WAS SO STAINED WITH BLACK AND OTHER DARK MARKS LIKE OLD BLOOD THAT LITTLE OF IT COULD BE READ GANDALF LIFTED IT CAREFULLY BUT THE LEAVES CRACKLED AND BROKE AS HE LAID IT ON THE SLAB HE PORED OVER IT FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT SPEAKING FRODO AND GIMLI STANDING AT HIS SIDE COULD SEE AS HE GINGERLY TURNED THE LEAVES THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN BY MANY DIFFERENT HANDS IN RUNES BOTH OF MORIA AND OF DALE AND HERE AND THERE IN ELVISH SCRIPT
AT LAST GANDALF LOOKED UP IT SEEMS TO BE A RECORD OF THE FORTUNES OF BALINS FOLK HE SAID I GUESS THAT IT BEGAN WITH THEIR COMING TO DIMRILL DALE NIGH ON THIRTY YEARS AGO THE PAGES SEEM TO HAVE NUMBERS REFERRING TO THE YEARS AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL THE TOP PAGE IS MARKED ONE  THREE SO AT LEAST TWO ARE MISSING FROM THE BEGINNING LISTEN TO THIS
WE DROVE OUT ORCS FROM THE GREAT GATE AND GUARD  I THINK THE NEXT WORD IS BLURRED AND BURNED PROBABLY ROOM  WE SLEW MANY IN THE BRIGHT  I THINK  SUN IN THE DALE FLOI WAS KILLED BY AN ARROW HE SLEW THE GREAT THEN THERE IS A BLUR FOLLOWED BY FLOI UNDER GRASS NEAR MIRRORMERE THE NEXT LINE OR TWO I CANNOT READ THEN COMES WE HAVE TAKEN THE TWENTYFIRST HALL OF NORTH END TO DWELL IN THERE IS I CANNOT READ WHAT A SHAFT IS MENTIONED THEN BALIN HAS SET UP HIS SEAT IN THE CHAMBER OF MAZARBUL
THE CHAMBER OF RECORDS SAID GIMLI I GUESS THAT IS WHERE WE NOW STAND

GANDALF PAUSED AND SET A FEW LEAVES ASIDE THERE ARE SEVERAL PAGES OF THE SAME SORT RATHER HASTILY WRITTEN AND MUCH DAMAGED HE SAID BUT I CAN MAKE LITTLE OF THEM IN THIS LIGHT NOW THERE MUST BE A NUMBER OF LEAVES MISSING BECAUSE THEY BEGIN TO BE NUMBERED FIVE THE FIFTH YEAR OF THE COLONY I SUPPOSE LET ME SEE NO THEY ARE TOO CUT AND STAINED I CANNOT READ THEM WE MIGHT DO BETTER IN THE SUNLIGHT WAIT HERE IS SOMETHING A LARGE BOLD HAND USING AN ELVISH SCRIPT
THAT WOULD BE ORIS HAND SAID GIMLI LOOKING OVER THE WIZARDS ARM HE COULD WRITE WELL AND SPEEDILY AND OFTEN USED THE ELVISH CHARACTERS
I FEAR HE HAD ILL TIDINGS TO RECORD IN A FAIR HAND SAID GANDALF THE FIRST CLEAR WORD IS SORROW BUT THE REST OF THE LINE IS LOST UNLESS IT ENDS IN ESTRE YES IT MUST BE YESTRE FOLLOWED BY DAY BEING THE TENTH OF NOVEMBRE BALIN LORD OF MORIA FELL IN DIMRILL DALE HE WENT ALONE TO LOOK IN MIRRORMERE AN ORC SHOT HIM FROM BEHIND A STONE WE SLEW THE ORC BUT MANY MORE UP FROM EAST UP THE SILVERLODE THE REMAINDER OF THE PAGE IS SO BLURRED THAT I CAN HARDLY MAKE ANYTHING OUT BUT I THINK I CAN READ WE HAVE BARRED THE GATES AND THEN CAN HOLD THEM LONG IF AND THEN PERHAPS HORRIBLE AND SUFFER POOR BALIN HE SEEMS TO HAVE KEPT THE TITLE THAT HE TOOK FOR LESS THAN FIVE YEARS I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARDS BUT THERE IS NO TIME TO PUZZLE OUT THE LAST FEW PAGES HERE IS THE LAST PAGE OF ALL HE PAUSED AND SIGHED

A SUDDEN DREAD AND A HORROR OF THE CHAMBER FELL ON THE COMPANY WE CANNOT GET OUT MUTTERED GIMLI IT WAS WELL FOR US THAT THE POOL HAD SUNK A LITTLE AND THAT THE WATCHER WAS SLEEPING DOWN AT THE SOUTHERN END
GANDALF RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ROUND THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE A LAST STAND BY BOTH DOORS HE SAID BUT THERE WERE NOT MANY LEFT BY THAT TIME SO ENDED THE ATTEMPT TO RETAKE MORIA IT WAS VALIANT BUT FOOLISH THE TIME IS NOT COME YET NOW I FEAR WE MUST SAY FAREWELL TO BALIN SON OF FUNDIN HERE HE MUST LIE IN THE HALLS OF HIS FATHERS WE WILL TAKE THIS BOOK THE BOOK OF MAZARBUL AND LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY LATER YOU HAD BETTER KEEP IT GIMLI AND TAKE IT BACK TO DAIN IF YOU GET A CHANCE IT WILL INTEREST HIM THOUGH IT WILL GRIEVE HIM DEEPLY COME LET US GO THE MORNING IS PASSING
WHICH WAY SHALL WE GO ASKED BOROMIR
BACK TO THE HALL ANSWERED GANDALF BUT OUR VISIT TO THIS ROOM HAS NOT BEEN IN VAIN I NOW KNOW WHERE WE ARE THIS MUST BE AS GIMLI SAYS THE CHAMBER OF MAZARBUL AND THE HALL MUST BE THE TWENTYFIRST OF THE NORTHEND THEREFORE WE SHOULD LEAVE BY THE EASTERN ARCH OF THE HALL AND BEAR RIGHT AND SOUTH AND GO DOWNWARDS THE TWENTYFIRST HALL SHOULD BE ON THE SEVENTH LEVEL THAT IS SIX ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE GATES COME NOW BACK TO THE HALL
GANDALF HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THESE WORDS WHEN THERE CAME A GREAT NOISE A ROLLING BOOM THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM DEPTHS FAR BELOW AND TO TREMBLE IN THE STONE AT THEIR FEET THEY SPRANG TOWARDS THE DOOR IN ALARM DOOM DOOM IT ROLLED AGAIN AS IF HUGE HANDS WERE TURNING THE VERY CAVERNS OF MORIA INTO A VAST DRUM THEN THERE CAME AN ECHOING BLAST A GREAT HORN WAS BLOWN IN THE HALL AND ANSWERING HORNS AND HARSH CRIES WERE HEARD FURTHER OFF THERE WAS A HURRYING SOUND OF MANY FEET
THEY ARE COMING CRIED LEGOLAS
WE CANNOT GET OUT SAID GIMLI
TRAPPED CRIED GANDALF WHY DID I DELAY HERE WE ARE CAUGHT JUST AS THEY WERE BEFORE BUT I WAS NOT HERE THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT 
DOOM DOOM CAME THE DRUMBEAT AND THE WALLS SHOOK
SLAM THE DOORS AND WEDGE THEM SHOUTED ARAGORN AND KEEP YOUR PACKS ON AS LONG AS YOU CAN WE MAY GET A CHANCE TO CUT OUR WAY OUT YET
NO SAID GANDALF WE MUST NOT GET SHUT IN KEEP THE EAST DOOR AJAR WE WILL GO THAT WAY IF WE GET A CHANCE
ANOTHER HARSH HORNCALL AND SHRILL CRIES RANG OUT FEET WERE COMING DOWN THE CORRIDOR THERE WAS A RING AND CLATTER AS THE COMPANY DREW THEIR SWORDS GLAMDRING SHONE WITH A PALE LIGHT AND STING GLINTED AT THE EDGES BOROMIR SET HIS SHOULDER AGAINST THE WESTERN DOOR
WAIT A MOMENT DO NOT CLOSE IT YET SAID GANDALF HE SPRANG FORWARD TO BOROMIRS SIDE AND DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
WHO COMES HITHER TO DISTURB THE REST OF BALIN LORD OF MORIA HE CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE
THERE WAS A RUSH OF HOARSE LAUGHTER LIKE THE FALL OF SLIDING STONES INTO A PIT AMID THE CLAMOUR A DEEP VOICE WAS RAISED IN COMMAND DOOM BOOM DOOM WENT THE DRUMS IN THE DEEP
WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT GANDALF STEPPED BEFORE THE NARROW OPENING OF THE DOOR AND THRUST FORWARD HIS STAFF THERE WAS A DAZZLING FLASH THAT LIT THE CHAMBER AND THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE FOR AN INSTANT THE WIZARD LOOKED OUT ARROWS WHINED AND WHISTLED DOWN THE CORRIDOR AS HE SPRANG BACK
THERE ARE ORCS VERY MANY OF THEM HE SAID AND SOME ARE LARGE AND EVIL BLACK URUKS OF MORDOR FOR THE MOMENT THEY ARE HANGING BACK BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THERE A GREAT CAVETROLL I THINK OR MORE THAN ONE THERE IS NO HOPE OF ESCAPE THAT WAY
AND NO HOPE AT ALL IF THEY COME AT THE OTHER DOOR AS WELL SAID BOROMIR
THERE IS NO SOUND OUTSIDE HERE YET SAID ARAGORN WHO WAS STANDING BY THE EASTERN DOOR LISTENING THE PASSAGE ON THIS SIDE PLUNGES STRAIGHT DOWN A STAIR IT PLAINLY DOES NOT LEAD BACK TOWARDS THE HALL BUT IT IS NO GOOD FLYING BLINDLY THIS WAY WITH THE PURSUIT JUST BEHIND WE CANNOT BLOCK THE DOOR ITS KEY IS GONE AND THE LOCK IS BROKEN AND IT OPENS INWARDS WE MUST DO SOMETHING TO DELAY THE ENEMY FIRST WE WILL MAKE THEM FEAR THE CHAMBER OF MAZARBUL HE SAID GRIMLY FEELING THE EDGE OF HIS SWORD ANDURIL
HEAVY FEET WERE HEARD IN THE CORRIDOR BOROMIR FLUNG HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOOR AND HEAVED IT TO THEN HE WEDGED IT WITH BROKEN SWORDBLADES AND SPLINTERS OF WOOD THE COMPANY RETREATED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBER BUT THEY HAD NO CHANCE TO FLY YET THERE WAS A BLOW ON THE DOOR THAT MADE IT QUIVER AND THEN IT BEGAN TO GRIND SLOWLY OPEN DRIVING BACK THE WEDGES A HUGE ARM AND SHOULDER WITH A DARK SKIN OF GREENISH SCALES WAS THRUST THROUGH THE WIDENING GAP THEN A GREAT FLAT TOELESS FOOT WAS FORCED THROUGH BELOW THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE OUTSIDE
BOROMIR LEAPED FORWARD AND HEWED AT THE ARM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BUT HIS SWORD RANG GLANCED ASIDE AND FELL FROM HIS SHAKEN HAND THE BLADE WAS NOTCHED
SUDDENLY AND TO HIS OWN SURPRISE FRODO FELT A HOT WRATH BLAZE UP IN HIS HEART THE SHIRE HE CRIED AND SPRINGING BESIDE BOROMIR HE STOOPED AND STABBED WITH STING AT THE HIDEOUS FOOT THERE WAS A BELLOW AND THE FOOT JERKED BACK NEARLY WRENCHING STING FROM FRODOS ARM BLACK DROPS DRIPPED FROM THE BLADE AND SMOKED ON THE FLOOR BOROMIR HURLED HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOOR AND SLAMMED IT AGAIN
ONE FOR THE SHIRE CRIED ARAGORN THE HOBBITS BITE IS DEEP YOU HAVE A GOOD BLADE FRODO SON OF DROGO
THERE WAS A CRASH ON THE DOOR FOLLOWED BY CRASH AFTER CRASH RAMS AND HAMMERS WERE BEATING AGAINST IT IT CRACKED AND STAGGERED BACK AND THE OPENING GREW SUDDENLY WIDE ARROWS CAME WHISTLING IN BUT STRUCK THE NORTHERN WALL AND FELL HARMLESSLY TO THE FLOOR THERE WAS A HORNBLAST AND A RUSH OF FEET AND ORCS ONE AFTER ANOTHER LEAPED INTO THE CHAMBER
HOW MANY THERE WERE THE COMPANY COULD NOT COUNT THE AFFRAY WAS SHARP BUT THE ORCS WERE DISMAYED BY THE FIERCENESS OF THE DEFENCE LEGOLAS SHOT TWO THROUGH THE THROAT GIMLI HEWED THE LEGS FROM UNDER ANOTHER THAT HAD SPRUNG UP ON BALINS TOMB BOROMIR AND ARAGORN SLEW MANY WHEN THIRTEEN HAD FALLEN THE REST FLED SHRIEKING LEAVING THE DEFENDERS UNHARMED EXCEPT FOR SAM WHO HAD A SCRATCH ALONG THE SCALP A QUICK DUCK HAD SAVED HIM AND HE HAD FELLED HIS ORC A STURDY THRUST WITH HIS BARROWBLADE A FIRE WAS SMOULDERING IN HIS BROWN EYES THAT WOULD HAVE MADE TED SANDYMAN STEP BACKWARDS IF HE HAD SEEN IT

BUT EVEN AS THEY RETREATED AND BEFORE PIPPIN AND MERRY HAD REACHED THE STAIR OUTSIDE A HUGE ORCCHIEFTAIN ALMOST MANHIGH CLAD IN BLACK MAIL FROM HEAD TO FOOT LEAPED INTO THE CHAMBER BEHIND HIM HIS FOLLOWERS CLUSTERED IN THE DOORWAY HIS BROAD FLAT FACE WAS SWART HIS EYES WERE LIKE COALS AND HIS TONGUE WAS RED HE WIELDED A GREAT SPEAR WITH A THRUST OF HIS HUGE HIDE SHIELD HE TURNED BOROMIRS SWORD AND BORE HIM BACKWARDS THROWING HIM TO THE GROUND DIVING UNDER ARAGORNS BLOW WITH THE SPEED OF A STRIKING SNAKE HE CHARGED INTO THE COMPANY AND THRUST WITH HIS SPEAR STRAIGHT AT FRODO THE BLOW CAUGHT HIM ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND FRODO WAS HURLED AGAINST THE WALL AND PINNED SAM WITH A CRY HACKED AT THE SPEARSHAFT AND IT BROKE BUT EVEN AS THE ORC FLUNG DOWN THE TRUNCHEON AND SWEPT OUT HIS SCIMITAR ANDURIL CAME DOWN UPON HIS HELM THERE WAS A FLASH LIKE FLAME AND THE HELM BURST ASUNDER THE ORC FELL WITH CLOVEN HEAD HIS FOLLOWERS FLED HOWLING AS BOROMIR AND ARAGORN SPRANG AT THEM
DOOM DOOM WENT THE DRUMS IN THE DEEP THE GREAT VOICE ROLLED OUT AGAIN

ARAGORN PICKED UP FRODO WHERE HE LAY BY THE WALL AND MADE FOR THE STAIR PUSHING MERRY AND PIPPIN IN FRONT OF HIM THE OTHERS FOLLOWED BUT GIMLI HAD TO BE DRAGGED AWAY BY LEGOLAS IN SPITE OF THE PERIL HE LINGERED BY BALINS TOMB WITH HIS HEAD BOWED BOROMIR HAULED THE EASTERN DOOR TO GRINDING UPON ITS HINGES IT HAD GREAT IRON RINGS ON EITHER SIDE BUT COULD NOT BE FASTENED
I AM ALL RIGHT GASPED FRODO I CAN WALK PUT ME DOWN
ARAGORN NEARLY DROPPED HIM IN HIS AMAZEMENT I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD HE CRIED
NOT YET SAID GANDALF BUT THERE IS TIME FOR WONDER OFF YOU GO ALL OF YOU DOWN THE STAIRS WAIT A FEW MINUTES FOR ME AT THE BOTTOM BUT IF I DO NOT COME SOON GO ON GO QUICKLY AND CHOOSE PATHS LEADING RIGHT AND DOWNWARDS
WE CANNOT LEAVE YOU TO HOLD THE DOOR ALONE SAID ARAGORN

THE PASSAGE WAS LIT BY NO SHAFT AND WAS UTTERLY DARK THEY GROPED THEIR WAY DOWN A LONG FLIGHT OF STEPS AND THEN LOOKED BACK BUT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT HIGH ABOVE THEM THE FAINT GLIMMER OF THE WIZARDS STAFF HE SEEMED TO BE STILL STANDING ON GUARD BY THE CLOSED DOOR FRODO BREATHED HEAVILY AND LEANED AGAINST SAM WHO PUT HIS ARMS ABOUT HIM THEY STOOD PEERING UP THE STAIRS INTO THE DARKNESS FRODO THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR THE VOICE OF GANDALF ABOVE MUTTERING WORDS THAT RAN DOWN THE SLOPING ROOF WITH A SIGHING ECHO HE COULD NOT CATCH WHAT WAS SAID THE WALLS SEEMED TO BE TREMBLING EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THE DRUMBEATS THROBBED AND ROLLED DOOM DOOM
SUDDENLY AT THE TOP OF THE STAIR THERE WAS A STAB OF WHITE LIGHT THEN THERE WAS A DULL RUMBLE AND A HEAVY THUD THE DRUMBEATS BROKE OUT WILDLY DOOMBOOM DOOMBOOM AND THEN STOPPED GANDALF CAME FLYING DOWN THE STEPS AND FELL TO THE GROUND IN THE MIDST OF THE COMPANY
WELL WELL THATS OVER SAID THE WIZARD STRUGGLING TO HIS FEET I HAVE DONE ALL THAT I COULD BUT I HAVE MET MY MATCH AND HAVE NEARLY BEEN DESTROYED BUT DONT STAND HERE GO ON YOU WILL HAVE TO DO WITHOUT LIGHT FOR A WHILE I AM RATHER SHAKEN GO ON GO ON WHERE ARE YOU GIMLI COME AHEAD WITH ME KEEP CLOSE BEHIND ALL OF YOU
THEY STUMBLED AFTER HIM WONDERING WHAT HAD HAPPENED DOOM DOOM WENT THE DRUMBEATS AGAIN THEY NOW SOUNDED MUFFLED AND FAR AWAY BUT THEY WERE FOLLOWING THERE WAS NO OTHER SOUND OF PURSUIT NEITHER TRAMP OF FEET NOR ANY VOICE GANDALF TOOK NO TURNS RIGHT OR LEFT FOR THE PASSAGE SEEMED TO BE GOING IN THE DIRECTION THAT HE DESIRED EVERY NOW AND AGAIN IT DESCENDED A FLIGHT OF STEPS FIFTY OR MORE TO A LOWER LEVEL AT THE MOMENT THAT WAS THEIR CHIEF DANGER FOR IN THE DARK THEY COULD NOT SEE A DESCENT UNTIL THEY CAME ON IT AND PUT THEIR FEET OUT INTO EMPTINESS GANDALF FELT THE GROUND WITH HIS STAFF LIKE A BLIND MAN
AT THE END OF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE A MILE OR MAYBE A LITTLE MORE AND HAD DESCENDED MANY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS THERE WAS STILL NO SOUND OF PURSUIT ALMOST THEY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THEY WOULD ESCAPE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEVENTH FLIGHT GANDALF HALTED
IT IS GETTING HOT HE GASPED WE OUGHT TO BE DOWN AT LEAST TO THE LEVEL OF THE GATES NOW SOON I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK FOR A LEFTHAND TURN TO TAKE US EAST I HOPE IT IS NOT FAR I AM VERY WEARY I MUST REST HERE A MOMENT EVEN IF ALL THE ORCS EVER SPAWNED ARE AFTER US
GIMLI TOOK HIS ARM AND HELPED HIM DOWN TO A SEAT ON THE STEP WHAT HAPPENED AWAY UP THERE AT THE DOOR HE ASKED DID YOU MEET THE BEATER OF THE DRUMS
I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED GANDALF BUT I FOUND MYSELF SUDDENLY FACED BY SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NOT MET BEFORE I COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO DO BUT TO TRY AND PUT A SHUTTINGSPELL ON THE DOOR I KNOW MANY BUT TO DO THINGS OF THAT KIND RIGHTLY REQUIRES TIME AND EVEN THEN THE DOOR CAN BE BROKEN BY STRENGTH
AS I STOOD THERE I COULD HEAR ORCVOICES ON THE OTHER SIDE AT ANY MOMENT I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BURST IT OPEN I COULD NOT HEAR WHAT WAS SAID THEY SEEMED TO BE TALKING IN THEIR OWN HIDEOUS LANGUAGE ALL I CAUGHT WAS GHASH THAT IS FIRE THEN SOMETHING CAME INTO THE CHAMBER  I FELT IT THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE ORCS THEMSELVES WERE AFRAID AND FELL SILENT IT LAID HOLD OF THE IRON RING AND THEN IT PERCEIVED ME AND MY SPELL
WHAT IT WAS I CANNOT GUESS BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT SUCH A CHALLENGE THE COUNTERSPELL WAS TERRIBLE IT NEARLY BROKE ME FOR AN INSTANT THE DOOR LEFT MY CONTROL AND BEGAN TO OPEN I HAD TO SPEAK A WORD OF COMMAND THAT PROVED TOO GREAT A STRAIN THE DOOR BURST IN PIECES SOMETHING DARK AS A CLOUD WAS BLOCKING OUT ALL THE LIGHT INSIDE AND I WAS THROWN BACKWARDS DOWN THE STAIRS ALL THE WALL GAVE WAY AND THE ROOF OF THE CHAMBER AS WELL I THINK
I AM AFRAID BALIN IS BURIED DEEP AND MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE IS BURIED THERE TOO I CANNOT SAY BUT AT LEAST THE PASSAGE BEHIND US WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED AH I HAVE NEVER FELT SO SPENT BUT IT IS PASSING AND NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU FRODO THERE WAS NOT TIME TO SAY SO BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DELIGHTED IN MY LIFE THAN WHEN YOU SPOKE I FEARED THAT IT WAS A BRAVE BUT DEAD HOBBIT THAT ARAGORN WAS CARRYING
WHAT ABOUT ME SAID FRODO I AM ALIVE AND WHOLE I THINK I AM BRUISED AND IN PAIN BUT IT IS NOT TOO BAD
WELL SAID ARAGORN I CAN ONLY SAY THAT HOBBITS ARE MADE OF A STUFF SO TOUGH THAT I HAVE NEVER MET THE LIKE OF IT HAD I KNOWN I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN SOFTER IN THE INN AT BREE THAT SPEARTHRUST WOULD HAVE SKEWERED A WILD BOAR
WELL IT DID NOT SKEWER ME I AM GLAD TO SAY SAID FRODO THOUGH I FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN CAUGHT BETWEEN A HAMMER AND AN ANVIL HE SAID NO MORE HE FOUND BREATHING PAINFUL
YOU TAKE AFTER BILBO SAID GANDALF THERE IS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN MEETS THE EYE AS I SAID OF HIM LONG AGO FRODO WONDERED IF THE REMARK MEANT MORE THAN IT SAID
THEY NOW WENT ON AGAIN BEFORE LONG GIMLI SPOKE HE HAD KEEN EYES IN THE DARK I THINK HE SAID THAT THERE IS A LIGHT AHEAD BUT IT IS NOT DAYLIGHT IT IS RED WHAT CAN IT BE
GHASH MUTTERED GANDALF I WONDER IF THAT IS WHAT THEY MEANT THAT THE LOWER LEVELS ARE ON FIRE STILL WE CAN ONLY GO ON
SOON THE LIGHT BECAME UNMISTAKABLE AND COULD BE SEEN BY ALL IT WAS FLICKERING AND GLOWING ON THE WALLS AWAY DOWN THE PASSAGE BEFORE THEM THEY COULD NOW SEE THEIR WAY IN FRONT THE ROAD SLOPED DOWN SWIFTLY AND SOME WAY AHEAD THERE STOOD A LOW ARCHWAY THROUGH IT THE GLOWING LIGHT CAME THE AIR BECAME VERY HOT
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE ARCH GANDALF WENT THROUGH SIGNING TO THEM TO WAIT AS HE STOOD JUST BEYOND THE OPENING THEY SAW HIS FACE LIT BY A RED GLOW QUICKLY HE STEPPED BACK
THERE IS SOME NEW DEVILRY HERE HE SAID DEVISED FOR OUR WELCOME NO DOUBT BUT I KNOW NOW WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE REACHED THE FIRST DEEP THE LEVEL IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE GATES THIS IS THE SECOND HALL OF OLD MORIA AND THE GATES ARE NEAR AWAY BEYOND THE EASTERN END ON THE LEFT NOT MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILE ACROSS THE BRIDGE UP A BROAD STAIR ALONG A WIDE ROAD THROUGH THE FIRST HALL AND OUT BUT COME AND LOOK
THEY PEERED OUT BEFORE THEM WAS ANOTHER CAVERNOUS HALL IT WAS LOFTIER AND FAR LONGER THAN THE ONE IN WHICH THEY HAD SLEPT THEY WERE NEAR ITS EASTERN END WESTWARD IT RAN AWAY INTO DARKNESS DOWN THE CENTRE STALKED A DOUBLE LINE OF TOWERING PILLARS THEY WERE CARVED LIKE BOLES OF MIGHTY TREES WHOSE BOUGHS UPHELD THE ROOF WITH A BRANCHING TRACERY OF STONE THEIR STEMS WERE SMOOTH AND BLACK BUT A RED GLOW WAS DARKLY MIRRORED IN THEIR SIDES RIGHT ACROSS THE FLOOR CLOSE TO THE FEET OF TWO HUGE PILLARS A GREAT FISSURE HAD OPENED OUT OF IT A FIERCE RED LIGHT CAME AND NOW AND AGAIN FLAMES LICKED AT THE BRINK AND CURLED ABOUT THE BASES OF THE COLUMNS WISPS OF DARK SMOKE WAVERED IN THE HOT AIR
IF WE HAD COME BY THE MAIN ROAD DOWN FROM THE UPPER HALLS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRAPPED HERE SAID GANDALF LET US HOPE THAT THE FIRE NOW LIES BETWEEN US AND PURSUIT COME THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
EVEN AS HE SPOKE THEY HEARD AGAIN THE PURSUING DRUMBEAT DOOM DOOM DOOM AWAY BEYOND THE SHADOWS AT THE WESTERN END OF THE HALL THERE CAME CRIES AND HORNCALLS DOOM DOOM THE PILLARS SEEMED TO TREMBLE AND THE FLAMES TO QUIVER
NOW FOR THE LAST RACE SAID GANDALF IF THE SUN IS SHINING OUTSIDE WE MAY STILL ESCAPE AFTER ME
HE TURNED LEFT AND SPED ACROSS THE SMOOTH FLOOR OF THE HALL THE DISTANCE WAS GREATER THAN IT HAD LOOKED AS THEY RAN THEY HEARD THE BEAT AND ECHO OF MANY HURRYING FEET BEHIND A SHRILL YELL WENT UP THEY HAD BEEN SEEN THERE WAS A RING AND CLASH OF STEEL AN ARROW WHISTLED OVER FRODOS HEAD
BOROMIR LAUGHED THEY DID NOT EXPECT THIS HE SAID THE FIRE HAS CUT THEM OFF WE ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE
LOOK AHEAD CALLED GANDALF THE BRIDGE IS NEAR IT IS DANGEROUS AND NARROW
SUDDENLY FRODO SAW BEFORE HIM A BLACK CHASM AT THE END OF THE HALL THE FLOOR VANISHED AND FELL TO AN UNKNOWN DEPTH THE OUTER DOOR COULD ONLY BE REACHED BY A SLENDER BRIDGE OF STONE WITHOUT KERB OR RAIL THAT SPANNED THE CHASM WITH ONE CURVING SPRING OF FIFTY FEET IT WAS AN ANCIENT DEFENCE OF THE DWARVES AGAINST ANY ENEMY THAT MIGHT CAPTURE THE FIRST HALL AND THE OUTER PASSAGES THEY COULD ONLY PASS ACROSS IT IN SINGLE FILE AT THE BRINK GANDALF HALTED AND THE OTHERS CAME UP IN A PACK BEHIND
LEAD THE WAY GIMLI HE SAID PIPPIN AND MERRY NEXT STRAIGHT ON AND UP THE STAIR BEYOND THE DOOR
ARROWS FELL AMONG THEM ONE STRUCK FRODO AND SPRANG BACK ANOTHER PIERCED GANDALFS HAT AND STUCK THERE LIKE A BLACK FEATHER FRODO LOOKED BEHIND BEYOND THE FIRE HE SAW SWARMING BLACK FIGURES THERE SEEMED TO BE HUNDREDS OF ORCS THEY BRANDISHED SPEARS AND SCIMITARS WHICH SHONE RED AS BLOOD IN THE FIRELIGHT DOOM DOOM ROLLED THE DRUMBEATS GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER DOOM DOOM
LEGOLAS TURNED AND SET AN ARROW TO THE STRING THOUGH IT WAS A LONG SHOT FOR HIS SMALL BOW HE DREW BUT HIS HAND FELL AND THE ARROW SLIPPED TO THE GROUND HE GAVE A CRY OF DISMAY AND FEAR TWO GREAT TROLLS APPEARED THEY BORE GREAT SLABS OF STONE AND FLUNG THEM DOWN TO SERVE AS GANGWAYS OVER THE FIRE BUT IT WAS NOT THE TROLLS THAT HAD FILLED THE ELF WITH TERROR THE RANKS OF THE ORCS HAD OPENED AND THEY CROWDED AWAY AS IF THEY THEMSELVES WERE AFRAID SOMETHING WAS COMING UP BEHIND THEM WHAT IT WAS COULD NOT BE SEEN IT WAS LIKE A GREAT SHADOW IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH WAS A DARK FORM OF MANSHAPE MAYBE YET GREATER AND A POWER AND TERROR SEEMED TO BE IN IT AND TO GO BEFORE IT
IT CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE FIRE AND THE LIGHT FADED AS IF A CLOUD HAD BENT OVER IT THEN WITH A RUSH IT LEAPED ACROSS THE FISSURE THE FLAMES ROARED UP TO GREET IT AND WREATHED ABOUT IT AND A BLACK SMOKE SWIRLED IN THE AIR ITS STREAMING MANE KINDLED AND BLAZED BEHIND IT IN ITS RIGHT HAND WAS A BLADE LIKE A STABBING TONGUE OF FIRE IN ITS LEFT IT HELD A WHIP OF MANY THONGS
AI AI WAILED LEGOLAS A BALROG A BALROG IS COME
GIMLI STARED WITH WIDE EYES DURINS BANE HE CRIED AND LETTING HIS AXE FALL HE COVERED HIS FACE
A BALROG MUTTERED GANDALF NOW I UNDERSTAND HE FALTERED AND LEANED HEAVILY ON HIS STAFF WHAT AN EVIL FORTUNE AND I AM ALREADY WEARY
THE DARK FIGURE STREAMING WITH FIRE RACED TOWARDS THEM THE ORCS YELLED AND POURED OVER THE STONE GANGWAYS THEN BOROMIR RAISED HIS HORN AND BLEW LOUD THE CHALLENGE RANG AND BELLOWED LIKE THE SHOUT OF MANY THROATS UNDER THE CAVERNOUS ROOF FOR A MOMENT THE ORCS QUAILED AND THE FIERY SHADOW HALTED THEN THE ECHOES DIED AS SUDDENLY AS A FLAME BLOWN OUT BY A DARK WIND AND THE ENEMY ADVANCED AGAIN
OVER THE BRIDGE CRIED GANDALF RECALLING HIS STRENGTH FLY THIS IS A FOE BEYOND ANY OF YOU I MUST HOLD THE NARROW WAY FLY ARAGORN AND BOROMIR DID NOT HEED THE COMMAND BUT STILL HELD THEIR GROUND SIDE BY SIDE BEHIND GANDALF AT THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE THE OTHERS HALTED JUST WITHIN THE DOORWAY AT THE HALLS END AND TURNED UNABLE TO LEAVE THEIR LEADER TO FACE THE ENEMY ALONE
THE BALROG REACHED THE BRIDGE GANDALF STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPAN LEANING ON THE STAFF IN HIS LEFT HAND BUT IN HIS OTHER HAND GLAMDRING GLEAMED COLD AND WHITE HIS ENEMY HALTED AGAIN FACING HIM AND THE SHADOW ABOUT IT REACHED OUT LIKE TWO VAST WINGS IT RAISED THE WHIP AND THE THONGS WHINED AND CRACKED FIRE CAME FROM ITS NOSTRILS BUT GANDALF STOOD FIRM
YOU CANNOT PASS HE SAID THE ORCS STOOD STILL AND A DEAD SILENCE FELL I AM A SERVANT OF THE SECRET FIRE WIELDER OF THE FLAME OF ANOR YOU CANNOT PASS THE DARK FIRE WILL NOT AVAIL YOU FLAME OF UDUN GO BACK TO THE SHADOW YOU CANNOT PASS
THE BALROG MADE NO ANSWER THE FIRE IN IT SEEMED TO DIE BUT THE DARKNESS GREW IT STEPPED FORWARD SLOWLY ON TO THE BRIDGE AND SUDDENLY IT DREW ITSELF UP TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND ITS WINGS WERE SPREAD FROM WALL TO WALL BUT STILL GANDALF COULD BE SEEN GLIMMERING IN THE GLOOM HE SEEMED SMALL AND ALTOGETHER ALONE GREY AND BENT LIKE A WIZENED TREE BEFORE THE ONSET OF A STORM
FROM OUT OF THE SHADOW A RED SWORD LEAPED FLAMING
GLAMDRING GLITTERED WHITE IN ANSWER
THERE WAS A RINGING CLASH AND A STAB OF WHITE FIRE THE BALROG FELL BACK AND ITS SWORD FLEW UP IN MOLTEN FRAGMENTS THE WIZARD SWAYED ON THE BRIDGE STEPPED BACK A PACE AND THEN AGAIN STOOD STILL
YOU CANNOT PASS HE SAID
WITH A BOUND THE BALROG LEAPED FULL UPON THE BRIDGE ITS WHIP WHIRLED AND HISSED
HE CANNOT STAND ALONE CRIED ARAGORN SUDDENLY AND RAN BACK ALONG THE BRIDGE ELENDIL HE SHOUTED I AM WITH YOU GANDALF
GONDOR CRIED BOROMIR AND LEAPED AFTER HIM
AT THAT MOMENT GANDALF LIFTED HIS STAFF AND CRYING ALOUD HE SMOTE THE BRIDGE BEFORE HIM THE STAFF BROKE ASUNDER AND FELL FROM HIS HAND A BLINDING SHEET OF WHITE FLAME SPRANG UP THE BRIDGE CRACKED RIGHT AT THE BALROGS FEET IT BROKE AND THE STONE UPON WHICH IT STOOD CRASHED INTO THE GULF WHILE THE REST REMAINED POISED QUIVERING LIKE A TONGUE OF ROCK THRUST OUT INTO EMPTINESS
WITH A TERRIBLE CRY THE BALROG FELL FORWARD AND ITS SHADOW PLUNGED DOWN AND VANISHED BUT EVEN AS IT FELL IT SWUNG ITS WHIP AND THE THONGS LASHED AND CURLED ABOUT THE WIZARDS KNEES DRAGGING HIM TO THE BRINK HE STAGGERED AND FELL GRASPED VAINLY AT THE STONE AND SLID INTO THE ABYSS FLY YOU FOOLS HE CRIED AND WAS GONE
THE FIRES WENT OUT AND BLANK DARKNESS FELL THE COMPANY STOOD ROOTED WITH HORROR STARING INTO THE PIT EVEN AS ARAGORN AND BOROMIR CAME FLYING BACK THE REST OF THE BRIDGE CRACKED AND FELL WITH A CRY ARAGORN ROUSED THEM
COME I WILL LEAD YOU NOW HE CALLED WE MUST OBEY HIS LAST COMMAND FOLLOW ME
THEY STUMBLED WILDLY UP THE GREAT STAIRS BEYOND THE DOOR ARAGORN LEADING BOROMIR AT THE REAR AT THE TOP WAS A WIDE ECHOING PASSAGE ALONG THIS THEY FLED FRODO HEARD SAM AT HIS SIDE WEEPING AND THEN HE FOUND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS WEEPING AS HE RAN DOOM DOOM DOOM THE DRUMBEATS ROLLED BEHIND MOURNFUL NOW AND SLOW DOOM
THEY RAN ON THE LIGHT GREW BEFORE THEM GREAT SHAFTS PIERCED THE ROOF THEY RAN SWIFTER THEY PASSED INTO A HALL BRIGHT WITH DAYLIGHT FROM ITS HIGH WINDOWS IN THE EAST THEY FLED ACROSS IT THROUGH ITS HUGE BROKEN DOORS THEY PASSED AND SUDDENLY BEFORE THEM THE GREAT GATES OPENED AN ARCH OF BLAZING LIGHT
THERE WAS A GUARD OF ORCS CROUCHING IN THE SHADOWS BEHIND THE GREAT DOOR POSTS TOWERING ON EITHER SIDE BUT THE GATES WERE SHATTERED AND CAST DOWN ARAGORN SMOTE TO THE GROUND THE CAPTAIN THAT STOOD IN HIS PATH AND THE REST FLED IN TERROR OF HIS WRATH THE COMPANY SWEPT PAST THEM AND TOOK NO HEED OF THEM OUT OF THE GATES THEY RAN AND SPRANG DOWN THE HUGE AND AGEWORN STEPS THE THRESHOLD OF MORIA
THUS AT LAST THEY CAME BEYOND HOPE UNDER THE SKY AND FELT THE WIND ON THEIR FACES
THEY DID NOT HALT UNTIL THEY WERE OUT OF BOWSHOT FROM THE WALLS DIMRILL DALE LAY ABOUT THEM THE SHADOW OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS LAY UPON IT BUT EASTWARDS THERE WAS A GOLDEN LIGHT ON THE LAND IT WAS BUT ONE HOUR AFTER NOON THE SUN WAS SHINING THE CLOUDS WERE WHITE AND HIGH
THEY LOOKED BACK DARK YAWNED THE ARCHWAY OF THE GATES UNDER THE MOUNTAINSHADOW FAINT AND FAR BENEATH THE EARTH ROLLED THE SLOW DRUMBEATS DOOM A THIN BLACK SMOKE TRAILED OUT NOTHING ELSE WAS TO BE SEEN THE DALE ALL AROUND WAS EMPTY DOOM GRIEF AT LAST WHOLLY OVERCAME THEM AND THEY WEPT LONG SOME STANDING AND SILENT SOME CAST UPON THE GROUND DOOM DOOM THE DRUMBEATS FADED



CHAPTER 6
LOTHLORIEN

ALAS I FEAR WE CANNOT STAY HERE LONGER SAID ARAGORN HE LOOKED TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS AND HELD UP HIS SWORD FAREWELL GANDALF HE CRIED DID I NOT SAY TO YOU IF YOU PASS THE DOORS OF MORIA BEWARE ALAS THAT I SPOKE TRUE WHAT HOPE HAVE WE WITHOUT YOU
HE TURNED TO THE COMPANY WE MUST DO WITHOUT HOPE HE SAID AT LEAST WE MAY YET BE AVENGED LET US GIRD OURSELVES AND WEEP NO MORE COME WE HAVE A LONG ROAD AND MUCH TO DO
THEY ROSE AND LOOKED ABOUT THEM NORTHWARD THE DALE RAN UP INTO A GLEN OF SHADOWS BETWEEN TWO GREAT ARMS OF THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE WHICH THREE WHITE PEAKS WERE SHINING CELEBDIL FANUIDHOL CARADHRAS THE MOUNTAINS OF MORIA AT THE HEAD OF THE GLEN A TORRENT FLOWED LIKE A WHITE LACE OVER AN ENDLESS LADDER OF SHORT FALLS AND A MIST OF FOAM HUNG IN THE AIR ABOUT THE MOUNTAINS FEET
YONDER IS THE DIMRILL STAIR SAID ARAGORN POINTING TO THE FALLS DOWN THE DEEPCLOVEN WAY THAT CLIMBS BESIDE THE TORRENT WE SHOULD HAVE COME IF FORTUNE HAD BEEN KINDER
OR CARADHRAS LESS CRUEL SAID GIMLI THERE HE STANDS SMILING IN THE SUN HE SHOOK HIS FIST AT THE FURTHEST OF THE SNOWCAPPED PEAKS AND TURNED AWAY
TO THE EAST THE OUTFLUNG ARM OF THE MOUNTAINS MARCHED TO A SUDDEN END AND FAR LANDS COULD BE DESCRIED BEYOND THEM WIDE AND VAGUE TO THE SOUTH THE MISTY MOUNTAINS RECEDED ENDLESSLY AS FAR AS SIGHT COULD REACH LESS THAN A MILE AWAY AND A LITTLE BELOW THEM FOR THEY STILL STOOD HIGH UP ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE DALE THERE LAY A MERE IT WAS LONG AND OVAL SHAPED LIKE A GREAT SPEARHEAD THRUST DEEP INTO THE NORTHERN GLEN BUT ITS SOUTHERN END WAS BEYOND THE SHADOWS UNDER THE SUNLIT SKY YET ITS WATERS WERE DARK A DEEP BLUE LIKE CLEAR EVENING SKY SEEN FROM A LAMPLIT ROOM ITS FACE WAS STILL AND UNRUFFLED ABOUT IT LAY A SMOOTH SWARD SHELVING DOWN ON ALL SIDES TO ITS BARE UNBROKEN RIM

THERE LIES THE MIRRORMERE DEEP KHELEDZARAM SAID GIMLI SADLY I REMEMBER THAT HE SAID MAY YOU HAVE JOY OF THE SIGHT BUT WE CANNOT LINGER THERE NOW LONG SHALL I JOURNEY ERE I HAVE JOY AGAIN IT IS I THAT MUST HASTEN AWAY AND HE THAT MUST REMAIN
THE COMPANY NOW WENT DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE GATES IT WAS ROUGH AND BROKEN FADING TO A WINDING TRACK BETWEEN HEATHER AND WHIN THAT THRUST AMID THE CRACKING STONES BUT STILL IT COULD BE SEEN THAT ONCE LONG AGO A GREAT PAVED WAY HAD WOUND UPWARDS FROM THE LOWLANDS OF THE DWARFKINGDOM IN PLACES THERE WERE RUINED WORKS OF STONE BESIDE THE PATH AND MOUNDS OF GREEN TOPPED WITH SLENDER BIRCHES OR FIRTREES SIGHING IN THE WIND AN EASTWARD BEND LED THEM HARD BY THE SWARD OF MIRRORMERE AND THERE NOT FAR FROM THE ROADSIDE STOOD A SINGLE COLUMN BROKEN AT THE TOP
THAT IS DURINS STONE CRIED GIMLI I CANNOT PASS WITHOUT TURNING ASIDE FOR A MOMENT TO LOOK AT THE WONDER OF THE DALE
BE SWIFT THEN SAID ARAGORN LOOKING BACK TOWARDS THE GATES THE SUN SINKS EARLY THE ORCS WILL NOT MAYBE COME OUT TILL AFTER DUSK BUT WE MUST BE FAR AWAY BEFORE NIGHTFALL THE MOON IS ALMOST SPENT AND IT WILL BE DARK TONIGHT
COME WITH ME FRODO CRIED THE DWARF SPRINGING FROM THE ROAD I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU GO WITHOUT SEEING KHELEDZARAM HE RAN DOWN THE LONG GREEN SLOPE FRODO FOLLOWED SLOWLY DRAWN BY THE STILL BLUE WATER IN SPITE OF HURT AND WEARINESS SAM CAME UP BEHIND
BESIDE THE STANDING STONE GIMLI HALTED AND LOOKED UP IT WAS CRACKED AND WEATHERWORN AND THE FAINT RUNES UPON ITS SIDE COULD NOT BE READ THIS PILLAR MARKS THE SPOT WHERE DURIN FIRST LOOKED IN THE MIRRORMERE SAID THE DWARF LET US LOOK OURSELVES ONCE ERE WE GO
THEY STOOPED OVER THE DARK WATER AT FIRST THEY COULD SEE NOTHING THEN SLOWLY THEY SAW THE FORMS OF THE ENCIRCLING MOUNTAINS MIRRORED IN A PROFOUND BLUE AND THE PEAKS WERE LIKE PLUMES OF WHITE FLAME ABOVE THEM BEYOND THERE WAS A SPACE OF SKY THERE LIKE JEWELS SUNK IN THE DEEP SHONE GLINTING STARS THOUGH SUNLIGHT WAS IN THE SKY ABOVE OF THEIR OWN STOOPING FORMS NO SHADOW COULD BE SEEN
O KHELEDZARAM FAIR AND WONDERFUL SAID GIMLI THERE LIES THE CROWN OF DURIN TILL HE WAKES FAREWELL HE BOWED AND TURNED AWAY AND HASTENED BACK UP THE GREENSWARD TO THE ROAD AGAIN
WHAT DID YOU SEE SAID PIPPIN TO SAM BUT SAM WAS TOO DEEP IN THOUGHT TO ANSWER
THE ROAD NOW TURNED SOUTH AND WENT QUICKLY DOWNWARDS RUNNING OUT FROM BETWEEN THE ARMS OF THE DALE SOME WAY BELOW THE MERE THEY CAME ON A DEEP WELL OF WATER CLEAR AS CRYSTAL FROM WHICH A FRESHET FELL OVER A STONE LIP AND RAN GLISTENING AND GURGLING DOWN A STEEP ROCKY CHANNEL
HERE IS THE SPRING FROM WHICH THE SILVERLODE RISES SAID GIMLI DO NOT DRINK OF IT IT IS ICY COLD
SOON IT BECOMES A SWIFT RIVER AND IT GATHERS WATER FROM MANY OTHER MOUNTAINSTREAMS SAID ARAGORN OUR ROAD LEADS BESIDE IT FOR MANY MILES FOR I SHALL TAKE YOU BY THE ROAD THAT GANDALF CHOSE AND FIRST I HOPE TO COME TO THE WOODS WHERE THE SILVERLODE FLOWS INTO THE GREAT RIVEROUT YONDER THEY LOOKED AS HE POINTED AND BEFORE THEM THEY COULD SEE THE STREAM LEAPING DOWN TO THE TROUGH OF THE VALLEY AND THEN RUNNING ON AND AWAY INTO THE LOWER LANDS UNTIL IT WAS LOST IN A GOLDEN HAZE
THERE LIE THE WOODS OF LOTHLORIEN SAID LEGOLAS THAT IS THE FAIREST OF ALL THE DWELLINGS OF MY PEOPLE THERE ARE NO TREES LIKE THE TREES OF THAT LAND FOR IN THE AUTUMN THEIR LEAVES FALL NOT BUT TURN TO GOLD NOT TILL THE SPRING COMES AND THE NEW GREEN OPENS DO THEY FALL AND THEN THE BOUGHS ARE LADEN WITH YELLOW FLOWERS AND THE FLOOR OF THE WOOD IS GOLDEN AND GOLDEN IS THE ROOF AND ITS PILLARS ARE OF SILVER FOR THE BARK OF THE TREES IS SMOOTH AND GREY SO STILL OUR SONGS IN MIRKWOOD SAY MY HEART WOULD BE GLAD IF I WERE BENEATH THE EAVES OF THAT WOOD AND IT WERE SPRINGTIME
MY HEART WILL BE GLAD EVEN IN THE WINTER SAID ARAGORN BUT IT LIES MANY MILES AWAY LET US HASTEN
FOR SOME TIME FRODO AND SAM MANAGED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS BUT ARAGORN WAS LEADING THEM AT A GREAT PACE AND AFTER A WHILE THEY LAGGED BEHIND THEY HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE THE EARLY MORNING SAMS CUT WAS BURNING LIKE FIRE AND HIS HEAD FELT LIGHT IN SPITE OF THE SHINING SUN THE WIND SEEMED CHILL AFTER THE WARM DARKNESS OF MORIA HE SHIVERED FRODO FELT EVERY STEP MORE PAINFUL AND HE GASPED FOR BREATH
AT LAST LEGOLAS TURNED AND SEEING THEM NOW FAR BEHIND HE SPOKE TO ARAGORN THE OTHERS HALTED AND ARAGORN RAN BACK CALLING TO BOROMIR TO COME WITH HIM
I AM SORRY FRODO HE CRIED FULL OF CONCERN SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED THIS DAY AND WE HAVE SUCH NEED OF HASTE THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT YOU WERE HURT AND SAM TOO YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN WE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO EASE YOU AS WE OUGHT THOUGH ALL THE ORCS OF MORIA WERE AFTER US COME NOW A LITTLE FURTHER ON THERE IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN REST FOR A LITTLE THERE I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU COME BOROMIR WE WILL CARRY THEM
SOON AFTERWARDS THEY CAME UPON ANOTHER STREAM THAT RAN DOWN FROM THE WEST AND JOINED ITS BUBBLING WATER WITH THE HURRYING SILVERLODE TOGETHER THEY PLUNGED OVER A FALL OF GREENHUED STONE AND FOAMED DOWN INTO A DELL ABOUT IT STOOD FIRTREES SHORT AND BENT AND ITS SIDES WERE STEEP AND CLOTHED WITH HARTSTONGUE AND SHRUBS OF WHORTLEBERRY AT THE BOTTOM THERE WAS A LEVEL SPACE THROUGH WHICH THE STREAM FLOWED NOISILY OVER SHINING PEBBLES HERE THEY RESTED IT WAS NOW NEARLY THREE HOURS AFTER NOON AND THEY HAD COME ONLY A FEW MILES FROM THE GATES ALREADY THE SUN WAS WESTERING
WHILE GIMLI AND THE TWO YOUNGER HOBBITS KINDLED A FIRE OF BRUSH AND FIRWOOD AND DREW WATER ARAGORN TENDED SAM AND FRODO SAMS WOUND WAS NOT DEEP BUT IT LOOKED UGLY AND ARAGORNS FACE WAS GRAVE AS HE EXAMINED IT AFTER A MOMENT HE LOOKED UP WITH RELIEF
GOOD LUCK SAM HE SAID MANY HAVE RECEIVED WORSE THAN THIS IN PAYMENT FOR THE SLAYING OF THEIR FIRST ORC THE CUT IS NOT POISONED AS THE WOUNDS OF ORCBLADES TOO OFTEN ARE IT SHOULD HEAL WELL WHEN I HAVE TENDED IT BATHE IT WHEN GIMLI HAS HEATED WATER
HE OPENED HIS POUCH AND DREW OUT SOME WITHERED LEAVES THEY ARE DRY AND SOME OF THEIR VIRTUE HAS ONE HE SAID BUT HERE I HAVE STILL SOME OF THE LEAVES OF ATHELAS THAT I GATHERED NEAR WEATHERTOP CRUSH ONE IN THE WATER AND WASH THE WOUND CLEAN AND I WILL BIND IT NOW IT IS YOUR TURN FRODO
I AM ALL RIGHT SAID FRODO RELUCTANT TO HAVE HIS GARMENTS TOUCHED ALL I NEEDED WAS SOME FOOD AND A LITTLE REST
NO SAID ARAGORN WE MUST HAVE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT THE HAMMER AND THE ANVIL HAVE DONE TO YOU I STILL MARVEL THAT YOU ARE ALIVE AT ALL GENTLY HE STRIPPED OFF FRODOS OLD JACKET AND WORN TUNIC AND GAVE A GASP OF WONDER THEN HE LAUGHED THE SILVER CORSLET SHIMMERED BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE LIGHT UPON A RIPPLING SEA CAREFULLY HE TOOK IT OFF AND HELD IT UP AND THE GEMS ON IT GLITTERED LIKE STARS AND THE SOUND OF THE SHAKEN RINGS WAS LIKE THE TINKLE OF RAIN IN A POOL
LOOK MY FRIENDS HE CALLED HERES A PRETTY HOBBITSKIN TO WRAP AN ELVENPRINCELING IN IF IT WERE KNOWN THAT HOBBITS HAD SUCH HIDES ALL THE HUNTERS OF MIDDLEEARTH WOULD BE RIDING TO THE SHIRE
AND ALL THE ARROWS OF ALL THE HUNTERS IN THE WORLD WOULD BE IN VAIN SAID GIMLI GAZING AT THE MAIL IN WONDER IT IS A MITHRILCOAT MITHRIL I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD TELL OF ONE SO FAIR IS THIS THE COAT THAT GANDALF SPOKE OF THEN HE UNDERVALUED IT BUT IT WAS WELL GIVEN
I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT YOU AND BILBO WERE DOING SO CLOSE IN HIS LITTLE ROOM SAID MERRY BLESS THE OLD HOBBIT I LOVE HIM MORE THAN EVER I HOPE WE GET A CHANCE OF TELLING HIM ABOUT IT
THERE WAS A DARK AND BLACKENED BRUISE ON FRODOS RIGHT SIDE AND BREAST UNDER THE MAIL THERE WAS A SHIRT OF SOFT LEATHER BUT AT ONE POINT THE RINGS HAD BEEN DRIVEN THROUGH IT INTO THE FLESH FRODOS LEFT SIDE ALSO WAS SCORED AND BRUISED WHERE HE HAD BEEN HURLED AGAINST THE WALL WHILE THE OTHERS SET THE FOOD READY ARAGORN BATHED THE HURTS WITH WATER IN WHICH ATHELAS WAS STEEPED THE PUNGENT FRAGRANCE FILLED THE DELL AND ALL THOSE WHO STOOPED OVER THE STEAMING WATER FELT REFRESHED AND STRENGTHENED SOON FRODO FELT THE PAIN LEAVE HIM AND HIS BREATH GREW EASY THOUGH HE WAS STIFF AND SORE TO THE TOUCH FOR MANY DAYS ARAGORN BOUND SOME SOFT PADS OF CLOTH AT HIS SIDE
THE MAIL IS MARVELLOUSLY LIGHT HE SAID PUT IT ON AGAIN IF YOU CAN BEAR IT MY HEART IS GLAD TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A COAT DO NOT LAY IT ASIDE EVEN IN SLEEP UNLESS FORTUNE BRINGS YOU WHERE YOU ARE SAFE FOR A WHILE AND THAT WILL SELDOM CHANCE WHILE YOUR QUEST LASTS
WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THE COMPANY GOT READY TO GO ON THEY PUT OUT THE FIRE AND HID ALL TRACES OF IT THEN CLIMBING OUT OF THE DELL THEY TOOK TO THE ROAD AGAIN THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE WESTWARD HEIGHTS AND GREAT SHADOWS CREPT DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDES DUSK VEILED THEIR FEET AND MIST ROSE IN THE HOLLOWS AWAY IN THE EAST THE EVENING LIGHT LAY PALE UPON THE DIM LANDS OF DISTANT PLAIN AND WOOD SAM AND FRODO NOW FEELING EASED AND GREATLY REFRESHED WERE ABLE TO GO AT A FAIR PACE AND WITH ONLY ONE BRIEF HALT ARAGORN LED THE COMPANY ON FOR NEARLY THREE MORE HOURS
IT WAS DARK DEEP NIGHT HAD FALLEN THERE WERE MANY CLEAR STARS BUT THE FASTWANING MOON WOULD NOT BE SEEN TILL LATE GIMLI AND FRODO WERE AT THE REAR WALKING SOFTLY AND NOT SPEAKING LISTENING FOR ANY SOUND UPON THE ROAD BEHIND AT LENGTH GIMLI BROKE THE SILENCE
NOT A SOUND BUT THE WIND HE SAID THERE ARE NO GOBLINS NEAR OR MY EARS ARE MADE OF WOOD IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE ORCS WILL BE CONTENT WITH DRIVING US FROM MORIA AND MAYBE THAT WAS ALL THEIR PURPOSE AND THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO WITH US  WITH THE RING THOUGH ORCS WILL OFTEN PURSUE FOES FOR MANY LEAGUES INTO THE PLAIN IF THEY HAVE A FALLEN CAPTAIN TO AVENGE
FRODO DID NOT ANSWER HE LOOKED AT STING AND THE BLADE WAS DULL YET HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OR THOUGHT HE HAD AS SOON AS THE SHADOWS HAD FALLEN ABOUT THEM AND THE ROAD BEHIND WAS DIM HE HAD HEARD AGAIN THE QUICK PATTER OF FEET EVEN NOW HE HEARD IT HE TURNED SWIFTLY THERE WERE TWO TINY GLEAMS OF LIGHT BEHIND OR FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE SAW THEM BUT AT ONCE THEY SLIPPED ASIDE AND VANISHED
WHAT IS IT SAID THE DWARF
I DONT KNOW ANSWERED FRODO I THOUGHT I HEARD FEET AND I THOUGHT I SAW A LIGHTLIKE EYES I HAVE THOUGHT SO OFTEN SINCE WE FIRST ENTERED MORIA
GIMLI HALTED AND STOOPED TO THE GROUND I HEAR NOTHING BUT THE NIGHTSPEECH OF PLANT AND STONE HE SAID COME LET US HURRY THE OTHERS ARE OUT OF SIGHT
THE NIGHTWIND BLEW CHILL UP THE VALLEY TO MEET THEM BEFORE THEM A WIDE GREY SHADOW LOOMED AND THEY HEARD AN ENDLESS RUSTLE OF LEAVES LIKE POPLARS IN THE BREEZE
LOTHLORIEN CRIED LEGOLAS LOTHLORIEN WE HAVE COME TO THE EAVES OF THE GOLDEN WOOD ALAS THAT IT IS WINTER
UNDER THE NIGHT THE TREES STOOD TALL BEFORE THEM ARCHED OVER THE ROAD AND STREAM THAT RAN SUDDENLY BENEATH THEIR SPREADING BOUGHS IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE STARS THEIR STEMS WERE GREY AND THEIR QUIVERING LEAVES A HINT OF FALLOW GOLD
LOTHLORIEN SAID ARAGORN GLAD I AM TO HEAR AGAIN THE WIND IN THE TREES WE ARE STILL LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE LEAGUES FROM THE GATES BUT WE CAN GO NO FURTHER HERE LET US HOPE THAT THE VIRTUE OF THE ELVES WILL KEEP US TONIGHT FROM THE PERIL THAT COMES BEHIND
IF ELVES INDEED STILL DWELL HERE IN THE DARKENING WORLD SAID GIMLI
IT IS LONG SINCE ANY OF MY OWN FOLK JOURNEYED HITHER BACK TO THE LAND WHENCE WE WANDERED IN AGES LONG AGO SAID LEGOLAS BUT WE HEAR THAT LORIEN IS NOT YET DESERTED FOR THERE IS A SECRET POWER HERE THAT HOLDS EVIL FROM THE LAND NEVERTHELESS ITS FOLK ARE SELDOM SEEN AND MAYBE THEY DWELL NOW DEEP IN THE WOODS AND FAR FROM THE NORTHERN BORDER
INDEED DEEP IN THE WOOD THEY DWELL SAID ARAGORN AND SIGHED AS IF SOME MEMORY STIRRED IN HIM WE MUST FEND FOR OURSELVES TONIGHT WE WILL GO FORWARD A SHORT WAY UNTIL THE TREES ARE ALL ABOUT US AND THEN WE WILL TURN ASIDE FROM THE PATH AND SEEK A PLACE TO REST IN
HE STEPPED FORWARD BUT BOROMIR STOOD IRRESOLUTE AND DID NOT FOLLOW IS THERE NO OTHER WAY HE SAID
WHAT OTHER FAIRER WAY WOULD YOU DESIRE SAID ARAGORN
A PLAIN ROAD THOUGH IT LED THROUGH A HEDGE OF SWORDS SAID BOROMIR BY STRANGE PATHS HAS THIS COMPANY BEEN LED AND SO FAR TO EVIL FORTUNE AGAINST MY WILL WE PASSED UNDER THE SHADES OF MORIA TO OUR LOSS AND NOW WE MUST ENTER THE GOLDEN WOOD YOU SAY BUT OF THAT PERILOUS LAND WE HAVE HEARD IN GONDOR AND IT IS SAID THAT FEW COME OUT WHO ONCE GO IN AND OF THAT FEW NONE HAVE ESCAPED UNSCATHED
SAY NOT UNSCATHED BUT IF YOU SAY UNCHANGED THEN MAYBE YOU WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH SAID ARAGORN BUT LORE WANES IN GONDOR BOROMIR IF IN THE CITY OF THOSE WHO ONCE WERE WISE THEY NOW SPEAK EVIL OF LOTHLORIEN BELIEVE WHAT YOU WILL THERE IS NO OTHER WAY FOR US  UNLESS YOU WOULD GO BACK TO MORIAGATE OR SCALE THE PATHLESS MOUNTAINS OR SWIM THE GREAT RIVER ALL ALONE
THEN LEAD ON SAID BOROMIR BUT IT IS PERILOUS
PERILOUS INDEED SAID ARAGORN FAIR AND PERILOUS BUT ONLY EVIL NEED FEAR IT OR THOSE WHO BRING SOME EVIL WITH THEM FOLLOW ME
THEY HAD GONE LITTLE MORE THAN A MILE INTO THE FOREST WHEN THEY CAME UPON ANOTHER STREAM FLOWING DOWN SWIFTLY FROM THE TREECLAD SLOPES THAT CLIMBED BACK WESTWARD TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS THEY HEARD IT SPLASHING OVER A FALL AWAY AMONG THE SHADOWS ON THEIR RIGHT ITS DARK HURRYING WATERS RAN ACROSS THE PATH BEFORE THEM AND JOINED THE SILVERLODE IN A SWIRL OF DIM POOLS AMONG THE ROOTS OF TREES
HERE IS NIMRODEL SAID LEGOLAS OF THIS STREAM THE SILVAN ELVES MADE MANY SONGS LONG AGO AND STILL WE SING THEM IN THE NORTH REMEMBERING THE RAINBOW ON ITS FALLS AND THE GOLDEN FLOWERS THAT FLOATED IN ITS FOAM ALL IS DARK NOW AND THE BRIDGE OF NIMRODEL IS BROKEN DOWN I WILL BATHE MY FEET FOR IT IS SAID THAT THE WATER IS HEALING TO THE WEARY HE WENT FORWARD AND CLIMBED DOWN THE DEEPCLOVEN BANK AND STEPPED INTO THE STREAM
FOLLOW ME HE CRIED THE WATER IS NOT DEEP LET US WADE ACROSS ON THE FURTHER BANK WE CAN REST AND THE SOUND OF THE FALLING WATER MAY BRING US SLEEP AND FORGETFULNESS OF GRIEF
ONE BY ONE THEY CLIMBED DOWN AND FOLLOWED LEGOLAS FOR A MOMENT FRODO STOOD NEAR THE BRINK AND LET THE WATER FLOW OVER HIS TIRED FEET IT WAS COLD BUT ITS TOUCH WAS CLEAN AND AS HE WENT ON AND IT MOUNTED TO HIS KNEES HE FELT THAT THE STAIN OF TRAVEL AND ALL WEARINESS WAS WASHED FROM HIS LIMBS
WHEN ALL THE COMPANY HAD CROSSED THEY SAT AND RESTED AND ATE A LITTLE FOOD AND LEGOLAS TOLD THEM TALES OF LOTHLORIEN THAT THE ELVES OF MIRKWOOD STILL KEPT IN THEIR HEARTS OF SUNLIGHT AND STARLIGHT UPON THE MEADOWS BY THE GREAT RIVER BEFORE THE WORLD WAS GREY
AT LENGTH A SILENCE FELL AND THEY HEARD THE MUSIC OF THE WATERFALL RUNNING SWEETLY IN THE SHADOWS ALMOST FRODO FANCIED THAT HE COULD HEAR A VOICE SINGING MINGLED WITH THE SOUND OF THE WATER
DO YOU HEAR THE VOICE OF NIMRODEL ASKED LEGOLAS I WILL SING YOU A SONG OF THE MAIDEN NIMRODEL WHO BORE THE SAME NAME AS THE STREAM BESIDE WHICH SHE LIVED LONG AGO IT IS A FAIR SONG IN OUR WOODLAND TONGUE BUT THIS IS HOW IT RUNS IN THE WESTRON SPEECH AS SOME IN RIVENDELL NOW SING IT IN A SOFT VOICE HARDLY TO BE HEARD AMID THE RUSTLE OF THE LEAVES ABOVE THEM HE BEGAN
AN ELVENMAID THERE WAS OF OLD
A SHINING STAR BY DAY
HER MANTLE WHITE WAS HEMMED WITH GOLD
HER SHOES OF SILVERGREY

A STAR WAS BOUND UPON HER BROWS
A LIGHT WAS ON HER HAIR
AS SUN UPON THE GOLDEN BOUGHS
IN LORIEN THE FAIR

HER HAIR WAS LONG HER LIMBS WERE WHITE
AND FAIR SHE WAS AND FREE
AND IN THE WIND SHE WENT AS LIGHT
AS LEAF OF LINDENTREE

BESIDE THE FALLS OF NIMRODEL
BY WATER CLEAR AND COOL
HER VOICE AS FALLING SILVER FELL
INTO THE SHINING POOL

WHERE NOW SHE WANDERS NONE CAN TELL
IN SUNLIGHT OR IN SHADE
FOR LOST OF YORE WAS NIMRODEL
AND IN THE MOUNTAINS STRAYED

THE ELVENSHIP IN HAVEN GREY
BENEATH THE MOUNTAINLEE
AWAITED HER FOR MANY A DAY
BESIDE THE ROARING SEA

A WIND BY NIGHT IN NORTHERN LANDS
AROSE AND LOUD IT CRIED
AND DROVE THE SHIP FROM ELVENSTRANDS
ACROSS THE STREAMING TIDE

WHEN DAWN CAME DIM THE LAND WAS LOST
THE MOUNTAINS SINKING GREY
BEYOND THE HEAVING WAVES THAT TOSSED
THEIR PLUMES OF BLINDING SPRAY

AMROTH BEHELD THE FADING SHORE
NOW LOW BEYOND THE SWELL
AND CURSED THE FAITHLESS SHIP THAT BORE
HIM FAR FROM NIMRODEL

OF OLD HE WAS AN ELVENKING
A LORD OF TREE AND GLEN
WHEN GOLDEN WERE THE BOUGHS IN SPRING
IN FAIR LOTHLORIEN

FROM HELM TO SEA THEY SAW HIM LEAP
AS ARROW FROM THE STRING
AND DIVE INTO THE WATER DEEP
AS MEW UPON THE WING

THE WIND WAS IN HIS FLOWING HAIR
THE FOAM ABOUT HIM SHONE
AFAR THEY SAW HIM STRONG AND FAIR
GO RIDING LIKE A SWAN

BUT FROM THE WEST HAS COME NO WORD
AND ON THE HITHER SHORE
NO TIDINGS ELVENFOLK HAVE HEARD
OF AMROTH EVERMORE

THE VOICE OF LEGOLAS FALTERED AND THE SONG CEASED I CANNOT SING ANY MORE HE SAID THAT IS BUT A PART FOR I HAVE FORGOTTEN MUCH IT IS LONG AND SAD FOR IT TELLS HOW SORROW CAME UPON LOTHLORIEN LORIEN OF THE BLOSSOM WHEN THE DWARVES AWAKENED EVIL IN THE MOUNTAINS
BUT THE DWARVES DID NOT MAKE THE EVIL SAID GIMLI
I SAID NOT SO YET EVIL CAME ANSWERED LEGOLAS SADLY THEN MANY OF THE ELVES OF NIMRODELS KINDRED LEFT THEIR DWELLINGS AND DEPARTED AND SHE WAS LOST FAR IN THE SOUTH IN THE PASSES OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND SHE CAME NOT TO THE SHIP WHERE AMROTH HER LOVER WAITED FOR HER BUT IN THE SPRING WHEN THE WIND IS IN THE NEW LEAVES THE ECHO OF HER VOICE MAY STILL BE HEARD BY THE FALLS THAT BEAR HER NAME AND WHEN THE WIND IS IN THE SOUTH THE VOICE OF AMROTH COMES UP FROM THE SEA FOR NIMRODEL FLOWS INTO SILVERLODE THAT ELVES CALL CELEBRANT AND CELEBRANT INTO ANDUIN THE GREAT AND ANDUIN FLOWS INTO THE BAY OF BELFALAS WHENCE THE ELVES OF LORIEN SET SAIL BUT NEITHER NIMRODEL NOR AMROTH EVER CAME BACK
IT IS TOLD THAT SHE HAD A HOUSE BUILT IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE THAT GREW NEAR THE FALLS FOR THAT WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE ELVES OF LORIEN TO DWELL IN THE TREES AND MAYBE IT IS SO STILL THEREFORE THEY WERE CALLED THE GALADHRIM THE TREEPEOPLE DEEP IN THEIR FOREST THE TREES ARE VERY GREAT THE PEOPLE OF THE WOODS DID NOT DELVE IN THE GROUND LIKE DWARVES NOR BUILD STRONG PLACES OF STONE BEFORE THE SHADOW CAME
AND EVEN IN THESE LATTER DAYS DWELLING IN THE TREES MIGHT BE THOUGHT SAFER THAN SITTING ON THE GROUND SAID GIMLI HE LOOKED ACROSS THE STREAM TO THE ROAD THAT LED BACK TO DIMRILL DALE AND THEN UP INTO THE ROOF OF DARK BOUGHS ABOVE
YOUR WORDS BRING GOOD COUNSEL GIMLI SAID ARAGORN WE CANNOT BUILD A HOUSE BUT TONIGHT WE WILL DO AS THE GALADHRIM AND SEEK REFUGE IN THE TREETOPS IF WE CAN WE HAVE SAT HERE BESIDE THE ROAD ALREADY LONGER THAN WAS WISE
THE COMPANY NOW TURNED ASIDE FROM THE PATH AND WENT INTO THE SHADOW OF THE DEEPER WOODS WESTWARD ALONG THE MOUNTAINSTREAM AWAY FROM SILVERLODE NOT FAR FROM THE FALLS OF NIMRODEL THEY FOUND A CLUSTER OF TREES SOME OF WHICH OVERHUNG THE STREAM THEIR GREAT GREY TRUNKS WERE OF MIGHTY GIRTH BUT THEIR HEIGHT COULD NOT BE GUESSED
I WILL CLIMB UP SAID LEGOLAS I AM AT HOME AMONG TREES BY ROOT OR BOUGH THOUGH THESE TREES ARE OF A KIND STRANGE TO ME SAVE AS A NAME IN SONG MELLYRN THEY ARE CALLED AND ARE THOSE THAT BEAR THE YELLOW BLOSSOM BUT I HAVE NEVER CLIMBED IN ONE I WILL SEE NOW WHAT IS THEIR SHAPE AND WAY OF GROWTH
WHATEVER IT MAY BE SAID PIPPIN THEY WILL BE MARVELLOUS TREES INDEED IF THEY CAN OFFER ANY REST AT NIGHT EXCEPT TO BIRDS I CANNOT SLEEP ON A PERCH
THEN DIG A HOLE IN THE GROUND SAID LEGOLAS IF THAT IS MORE AFTER THE FASHION OF YOUR KIND BUT YOU MUST DIG SWIFT AND DEEP IF YOU WISH TO HIDE FROM ORCS HE SPRANG LIGHTLY UP FROM THE GROUND AND CAUGHT A BRANCH THAT GREW FROM THE TRUNK HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD BUT EVEN AS HE SWUNG THERE FOR A MOMENT A VOICE SPOKE SUDDENLY FROM THE TREESHADOWS ABOVE HIM
DARO IT SAID IN COMMANDING TONE AND LEGOLAS DROPPED BACK TO EARTH IN SURPRISE AND FEAR HE SHRANK AGAINST THE BOLE OF THE TREE
STAND STILL HE WHISPERED TO THE OTHERS DO NOT MOVE OR SPEAK
THERE WAS A SOUND OF SOFT LAUGHTER OVER THEIR HEADS AND THEN ANOTHER CLEAR VOICE SPOKE IN AN ELVENTONGUE FRODO COULD UNDERSTAND LITTLE OF WHAT WAS SAID FOR THE SPEECH THAT THE SILVAN FOLK EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS USED AMONG THEMSELVES WAS UNLIKE THAT OF THE WEST LEGOLAS LOOKED UP AND ANSWERED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE8
WHO ARE THEY AND WHAT DO THEY SAY ASKED MERRY
THEYRE ELVES SAID SAM CANT YOU HEAR THEIR VOICES
YES THEY ARE ELVES SAID LEGOLAS AND THEY SAY THAT YOU BREATHE SO LOUD THAT THEY COULD SHOOT YOU IN THE DARK SAM HASTILY PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS MOUTH BUT THEY SAY ALSO THAT YOU NEED HAVE NO FEAR THEY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF US FOR A LONG WHILE THEY HEARD MY VOICE ACROSS THE NIMRODEL AND KNEW THAT I WAS ONE OF THEIR NORTHERN KINDRED AND THEREFORE THEY DID NOT HINDER OUR CROSSING AND AFTERWARDS THEY HEARD MY SONG NOW THEY BID ME CLIMB UP WITH FRODO FOR THEY SEEM TO HAVE HAD SOME TIDINGS OF HIM AND OF OUR JOURNEY THE OTHERS THEY ASK TO WAIT A LITTLE AND TO KEEP WATCH AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE UNTIL THEY HAVE DECIDED WHAT IS TO BE DONE
OUT OF THE SHADOWS A LADDER WAS LET DOWN IT WAS MADE OF ROPE SILVERGREY AND GLIMMERING IN THE DARK AND THOUGH IT LOOKED SLENDER IT PROVED STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR MANY MEN LEGOLAS RAN LIGHTLY UP AND FRODO FOLLOWED SLOWLY BEHIND CAME SAM TRYING NOT TO BREATHE LOUDLY THE BRANCHES OF THE MALLORNTREE GREW OUT NEARLY STRAIGHT FROM THE TRUNK AND THEN SWEPT UPWARD BUT NEAR THE TOP THE MAIN STEM DIVIDED INTO A CROWN OF MANY BOUGHS AND AMONG THESE THEY FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN BUILT A WOODEN PLATFORM OR FLET AS SUCH THINGS WERE CALLED IN THOSE DAYS THE ELVES CALLED IT A TALAN IT WAS REACHED BY A ROUND HOLE IN THE CENTRE THROUGH WHICH THE LADDER PASSED
WHEN FRODO CAME AT LAST UP ON TO THE FLET HE FOUND LEGOLAS SEATED WITH THREE OTHER ELVES THEY WERE CLAD IN SHADOWYGREY AND COULD NOT BE SEEN AMONG THE TREESTEMS UNLESS THEY MOVED SUDDENLY THEY STOOD UP AND ONE OF THEM UNCOVERED A SMALL LAMP THAT GAVE OUT A SLENDER SILVER BEAM HE HELD IT UP LOOKING AT FRODOS FACE AND SAMS THEN HE SHUT OFF THE LIGHT AGAIN AND SPOKE WORDS OF WELCOME IN HIS ELVENTONGUE FRODO SPOKE HALTINGLY IN RETURN
WELCOME THE ELF THEN SAID AGAIN IN THE COMMON LANGUAGE SPEAKING SLOWLY WE SELDOM USE ANY TONGUE BUT OUR OWN FOR WE DWELL NOW IN THE HEART OF THE FOREST AND DO NOT WILLINGLY HAVE DEALINGS WITH ANY OTHER FOLK EVEN OUR OWN KINDRED IN THE NORTH ARE SUNDERED FROM US BUT THERE ARE SOME OF US STILL WHO GO ABROAD FOR THE GATHERING OF NEWS AND THE WATCHING OF OUR ENEMIES AND THEY SPEAK THE LANGUAGES OF OTHER LANDS I AM ONE HALDIR IS MY NAME MY BROTHERS RUMIL AND OROPHIN SPEAK LITTLE OF YOUR TONGUE
BUT WE HAVE HEARD RUMOURS OF YOUR COMING FOR THE MESSENGERS OF ELROND PASSED BY LORIEN ON THEIR WAY HOME UP THE DIMRILL STAIR WE HAD NOT HEARD OF HOBBITS OR HALFLINGS FOR MANY A LONG YEAR AND DID NOT KNOW THAT ANY YET DWELT IN MIDDLEEARTH YOU DO NOT LOOK EVIL AND SINCE YOU COME WITH AN ELF OF OUR KINDRED WE ARE WILLING TO BEFRIEND YOU AS ELROND ASKED THOUGH IT IS NOT OUR CUSTOM TO LEAD STRANGERS THROUGH OUR LAND BUT YOU MUST STAY HERE TONIGHT HOW MANY ARE YOU
EIGHT SAID LEGOLAS MYSELF FOUR HOBBITS AND TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM ARAGORN IS AN ELFFRIEND OF THE FOLK OF WESTERNESSE
THE NAME OF ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN IS KNOWN IN LORIEN SAID HALDIR AND HE HAS THE FAVOUR OF THE LADY ALL THEN IS WELL BUT YOU HAVE YET SPOKEN ONLY OF SEVEN
THE EIGHTH IS A DWARF SAID LEGOLAS
A DWARF SAID HALDIR THAT IS NOT WELL WE HAVE NOT HAD DEALINGS WITH THE DWARVES SINCE THE DARK DAYS THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED IN OUR LAND I CANNOT ALLOW HIM TO PASS
BUT HE IS FROM THE LONELY MOUNTAIN ONE OF DAINS TRUSTY PEOPLE AND FRIENDLY TO ELROND SAID FRODO ELROND HIMSELF CHOSE HIM TO BE ONE OF OUR COMPANIONS AND HE HAS BEEN BRAVE AND FAITHFUL
THE ELVES SPOKE TOGETHER IN SOFT VOICES AND QUESTIONED LEGOLAS IN THEIR OWN TONGUE VERY GOOD SAID HALDIR AT LAST WE WILL DO THIS THOUGH IT IS AGAINST OUR LIKING IF ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS WILL GUARD HIM AND ANSWER FOR HIM HE SHALL PASS BUT HE MUST GO BLINDFOLD THROUGH LOTHLORIEN
BUT NOW WE MUST DEBATE NO LONGER YOUR FOLK MUST NOT REMAIN ON THE GROUND WE HAVE BEEN KEEPING WATCH ON THE RIVERS EVER SINCE WE SAW A GREAT TROOP OF ORCS GOING NORTH TOWARD MORIA ALONG THE SKIRTS OF THE MOUNTAINS MANY DAYS AGO WOLVES ARE HOWLING ON THE WOODS BORDERS IF YOU HAVE INDEED COME FROM MORIA THE PERIL CANNOT BE FAR BEHIND TOMORROW EARLY YOU MUST GO ON
THE FOUR HOBBITS SHALL CLIMB UP HERE AND STAY WITH USWE DO NOT FEAR THEM THERE IS ANOTHER TALAN IN THE NEXT TREE THERE THE OTHERS MUST TAKE REFUGE YOU LEGOLAS MUST ANSWER TO US FOR THEM CALL US IF ANYTHING IS AMISS AND HAVE AN EYE ON THAT DWARF
LEGOLAS AT ONCE WENT DOWN THE LADDER TO TAKE HALDIRS MESSAGE AND SOON AFTERWARDS MERRY AND PIPPIN CLAMBERED UP ON TO THE HIGH FLET THEY WERE OUT OF BREATH AND SEEMED RATHER SCARED
THERE SAID MERRY PANTING WE HAVE LUGGED UP YOUR BLANKETS AS WELL AS OUR OWN STRIDER HAS HIDDEN ALL THE REST OF THE BAGGAGE IN A DEEP DRIFT OF LEAVES
YOU HAD NO NEED OF YOUR BURDENS SAID HALDIR IT IS COLD IN THE TREETOPS IN WINTER THOUGH THE WIND TONIGHT IS IN THE SOUTH BUT WE HAVE FOOD AND DRINK TO GIVE YOU THAT WILL DRIVE AWAY THE NIGHTCHILL AND WE HAVE SKINS AND CLOAKS TO SPARE
THE HOBBITS ACCEPTED THIS SECOND AND FAR BETTER SUPPER VERY GLADLY THEN THEY WRAPPED THEMSELVES WARMLY NOT ONLY IN THE FURCLOAKS OF THE ELVES BUT IN THEIR OWN BLANKETS AS WELL AND TRIED TO GO TO SLEEP BUT WEARY AS THEY WERE ONLY SAM FOUND THAT EASY TO DO HOBBITS DO NOT LIKE HEIGHTS AND DO NOT SLEEP UPSTAIRS EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE ANY STAIRS THE FLET WAS NOT AT ALL TO THEIR LIKING AS A BEDROOM IT HAD NO WALLS NOT EVEN A RAIL ONLY ON ONE SIDE WAS THERE A LIGHT PLAITED SCREEN WHICH COULD BE MOVED AND FIXED IN DIFFERENT PLACES ACCORDING TO THE WIND
PIPPIN WENT ON TALKING FOR A WHILE I HOPE IF I DO GO TO SLEEP IN THIS BEDLOFT THAT I SHANT ROLL OFF HE SAID
ONCE I DO GET TO SLEEP SAID SAM I SHALL GO ON SLEEPING WHETHER I ROLL OFF OR NO AND THE LESS SAID THE SOONER ILL DROP OFF IF YOU TAKE MY MEANING
FRODO LAY FOR SOME TIME AWAKE AND LOOKED UP AT THE STARS GLINTING THROUGH THE PALE ROOF OF QUIVERING LEAVES SAM WAS SNORING AT HIS SIDE LONG BEFORE HE HIMSELF CLOSED HIS EYES HE COULD DIMLY SEE THE GREY FORMS OF TWO ELVES SITTING MOTIONLESS WITH THEIR ARMS ABOUT THEIR KNEES SPEAKING IN WHISPERS THE OTHER HAD GONE DOWN TO TAKE UP HIS WATCH ON ONE OF THE LOWER BRANCHES AT LAST LULLED BY THE WIND IN THE BOUGHS ABOVE AND THE SWEET MURMUR OF THE FALLS OF NIMRODEL BELOW FRODO FELL ASLEEP WITH THE SONG OF LEGOLAS RUNNING IN HIS MIND
LATE IN THE NIGHT HE AWOKE THE OTHER HOBBITS WERE ASLEEP THE ELVES WERE GONE THE SICKLE MOON WAS GLEAMING DIMLY AMONG THE LEAVES THE WIND WAS STILL A LITTLE WAY OFF HE HEARD A HARSH LAUGH AND THE TREAD OF MANY FEET ON THE GROUND BELOW THERE WAS A RING OF METAL THE SOUNDS DIED SLOWLY AWAY AND SEEMED TO GO SOUTHWARD ON INTO THE WOOD
A HEAD APPEARED SUDDENLY THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLET FRODO SAT UP IN ALARM AND SAW THAT IT WAS A GREYHOODED ELF HE LOOKED TOWARDS THE HOBBITS
WHAT IS IT SAID FRODO
YRCH SAID THE ELF IN A HISSING WHISPER AND CAST ON TO THE FLET THE ROPELADDER ROLLED UP
ORCS SAID FRODO WHAT ARE THEY DOING BUT THE ELF HAD GONE
THERE WERE NO MORE SOUNDS EVEN THE LEAVES WERE SILENT AND THE VERY FALLS SEEMED TO BE HUSHED FRODO SAT AND SHIVERED IN HIS WRAPS HE WAS THANKFUL THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN CAUGHT ON THE GROUND BUT HE FELT THAT THE TREES OFFERED LITTLE PROTECTION EXCEPT CONCEALMENT ORCS WERE AS KEEN AS HOUNDS ON A SCENT IT WAS SAID BUT THEY COULD ALSO CLIMB HE DREW OUT STING IT FLASHED AND GLITTERED LIKE A BLUE FLAME AND THEN SLOWLY FADED AGAIN AND GREW DULL IN SPITE OF THE FADING OF HIS SWORD THE FEELING OF IMMEDIATE DANGER DID NOT LEAVE FRODO RATHER IT GREW STRONGER HE GOT UP AND CRAWLED TO THE OPENING AND PEERED DOWN HE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT HE COULD HEAR STEALTHY MOVEMENTS AT THE TREES FOOT FAR BELOW
NOT ELVES FOR THE WOODLAND FOLK WERE ALTOGETHER NOISELESS IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THEN HE HEARD FAINTLY A SOUND LIKE SNIFFING AND SOMETHING SEEMED TO BE SCRABBLING ON THE BARK OF THE TREETRUNK HE STARED DOWN INTO THE DARK HOLDING HIS BREATH
SOMETHING WAS NOW CLIMBING SLOWLY AND ITS BREATH CAME LIKE A SOFT HISSING THROUGH CLOSED TEETH THEN COMING UP CLOSE TO THE STEM FRODO SAW TWO PALE EYES THEY STOPPED AND GAZED UPWARD UNWINKING SUDDENLY THEY TURNED AWAY AND A SHADOWY FIGURE SLIPPED ROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND VANISHED
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS HALDIR CAME CLIMBING SWIFTLY UP THROUGH THE BRANCHES THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS TREE THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE HE SAID IT WAS NOT AN ORC IT FLED AS SOON AS I TOUCHED THE TREESTEM IT SEEMED TO BE WARY AND TO HAVE SOME SKILL IN TREES OR I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ONE OF YOU HOBBITS
I DID NOT SHOOT FOR I DARED NOT AROUSE ANY CRIES WE CANNOT RISK BATTLE A STRONG COMPANY OF ORCS HAS PASSED THEY CROSSED THE NIMRODEL  CURSE THEIR FOUL FEET IN ITS CLEAN WATER  AND WENT ON DOWN THE OLD ROAD BESIDE THE RIVER THEY SEEMED TO PICK UP SOME SCENT AND THEY SEARCHED THE GROUND FOR A WHILE NEAR THE PLACE WHERE YOU HALTED THE THREE OF US COULD NOT CHALLENGE A HUNDRED SO WE WENT AHEAD AND SPOKE WITH FEIGNED VOICES LEADING THEM ON INTO THE WOOD
OROPHIN HAS NOW GONE IN HASTE BACK TO OUR DWELLINGS TO WARN OUR PEOPLE NONE OF THE ORCS WILL EVER RETURN OUT OF LORIEN AND THERE WILL BE MANY ELVES HIDDEN ON THE NORTHERN BORDER BEFORE ANOTHER NIGHT FALLS BUT YOU MUST TAKE THE ROAD SOUTH AS SOON AS IT IS FULLY LIGHT
DAY CAME PALE FROM THE EAST AS THE LIGHT GREW IT FILTERED THROUGH THE YELLOW LEAVES OF THE MALLORN AND IT SEEMED TO THE HOBBITS THAT THE EARLY SUN OF A COOL SUMMERS MORNING WAS SHINING PALEBLUE SKY PEEPED AMONG THE MOVING BRANCHES LOOKING THROUGH AN OPENING ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE FLET FRODO SAW ALL THE VALLEY OF THE SILVERLODE LYING LIKE A SEA OF FALLOW GOLD TOSSING GENTLY IN THE BREEZE
THE MORNING WAS STILL YOUNG AND COLD WHEN THE COMPANY SET OUT AGAIN GUIDED NOW BY HALDIR AND HIS BROTHER RUMIL FAREWELL SWEET NIMRODEL CRIED LEGOLAS FRODO LOOKED BACK AND CAUGHT A GLEAM OF WHITE FOAM AMONG THE GREY TREESTEMS FAREWELL HE SAID IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NEVER HEAR AGAIN A RUNNING WATER SO BEAUTIFUL FOR EVER BLENDING ITS INNUMERABLE NOTES IN AN ENDLESS CHANGEFUL MUSIC
THEY WENT BACK TO THE PATH THAT STILL WENT ON ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF THE SILVERLODE AND FOR SOME WAY THEY FOLLOWED IT SOUTHWARD THERE WERE THE PRINTS OF ORCFEET IN THE EARTH BUT SOON HALDIR TURNED ASIDE INTO THE TREES AND HALTED ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER UNDER THEIR SHADOWS
THERE IS ONE OF MY PEOPLE YONDER ACROSS THE STREAM HE SAID THOUGH YOU MAY NOT SEE HIM HE GAVE A CALL LIKE THE LOW WHISTLE OF A BIRD AND OUT OF A THICKET OF YOUNG TREES AN ELF STEPPED CLAD IN GREY BUT WITH HIS HOOD THROWN BACK HIS HAIR GLINTED LIKE GOLD IN THE MORNING SUN HALDIR SKILFULLY CAST OVER THE STREAM A COIL OF GREY ROPE AND HE CAUGHT IT AND BOUND THE END ABOUT A TREE NEAR THE BANK
CELEBRANT IS ALREADY A STRONG STREAM HERE AS YOU SEE SAID HALDIR AND IT RUNS BOTH SWIFT AND DEEP AND IS VERY COLD WE DO NOT SET FOOT IN IT SO FAR NORTH UNLESS WE MUST BUT IN THESE DAYS OF WATCHFULNESS WE DO NOT MAKE BRIDGES THIS IS HOW WE CROSS FOLLOW ME HE MADE HIS END OF THE ROPE FAST ABOUT ANOTHER TREE AND THEN RAN LIGHTLY ALONG IT OVER THE RIVER AND BACK AGAIN AS IF HE WERE ON A ROAD
I CAN WALK THIS PATH SAID LEGOLAS BUT THE OTHERS HAVE NOT THIS SKILL MUST THEY SWIM
NO SAID HALDIR WE HAVE TWO MORE ROPES WE WILL FASTEN THEM ABOVE THE OTHER ONE SHOULDERHIGH AND ANOTHER HALFHIGH AND HOLDING THESE THE STRANGERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CROSS WITH CARE
WHEN THIS SLENDER BRIDGE HAD BEEN MADE THE COMPANY PASSED OVER SOME CAUTIOUSLY AND SLOWLY OTHERS MORE EASILY OF THE HOBBITS PIPPIN PROVED THE BEST FOR HE WAS SUREFOOTED AND HE WALKED OVER QUICKLY HOLDING ONLY WITH ONE HAND BUT HE KEPT HIS EYES ON THE BANK AHEAD AND DID NOT LOOK DOWN SAM SHUFFLED ALONG CLUTCHING HARD AND LOOKING DOWN INTO THE PALE EDDYING WATER AS IF IT WAS A CHASM IN THE MOUNTAINS
HE BREATHED WITH RELIEF WHEN HE WAS SAFELY ACROSS LIVE AND LEARN AS MY GAFFER USED TO SAY THOUGH HE WAS THINKING OF GARDENING NOT OF ROOSTING LIKE A BIRD NOR OF TRYING TO WALK LIKE A SPIDER NOT EVEN MY UNCLE ANDY EVER DID A TRICK LIKE THAT
WHEN AT LENGTH ALL THE COMPANY WAS GATHERED ON THE EAST BANK OF THE SILVERLODE THE ELVES UNTIED THE ROPES AND COILED TWO OF THEM RUMIL WHO HAD REMAINED ON THE OTHER SIDE DREW BACK THE LAST ONE SLUNG IT ON HIS SHOULDER AND WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND WENT AWAY BACK TO NIMRODEL TO KEEP WATCH
NOW FRIENDS SAID HALDIR YOU HAVE ENTERED THE NAITH OF LORIEN OR THE GORE AS YOU WOULD SAY FOR IT IS THE LAND THAT LIES LIKE A SPEARHEAD BETWEEN THE ARMS OF SILVERLODE AND ANDUIN THE GREAT WE ALLOW NO STRANGERS TO SPY OUT THE SECRETS OF THE NAITH FEW INDEED ARE PERMITTED EVEN TO SET FOOT THERE
AS WAS AGREED I SHALL HERE BLINDFOLD THE EYES OF GIMLI THE DWARF THE OTHER MAY WALK FREE FOR A WHILE UNTIL WE COME NEARER TO OUR DWELLINGS DOWN IN EGLADIL IN THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE WATERS
THIS WAS NOT AT ALL TO THE LIKING OF GIMLI THE AGREEMENT WAS MADE WITHOUT MY CONSENT HE SAID I WILL NOT WALK BLINDFOLD LIKE A BEGGAR OR A PRISONER AND I AM NO SPY MY FOLK HAVE NEVER HAD DEALINGS WITH ANY OF THE SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY NEITHER HAVE WE DONE HARM TO THE ELVES I AM NO MORE LIKELY TO BETRAY YOU THAN LEGOLAS OR ANY OTHER OF MY COMPANIONS
I DO NOT DOUBT YOU SAID HALDIR YET THIS IS OUR LAW I AM NOT THE MASTER OF THE LAW AND CANNOT SET IT ASIDE I HAVE DONE MUCH IN LETTING YOU SET FOOT OVER CELEBRANT
GIMLI WAS OBSTINATE HE PLANTED HIS FEET FIRMLY APART AND LAID HIS HAND UPON THE HAFT OF HIS AXE I WILL GO FORWARD FREE HE SAID OR I WILL GO BACK AND SEEK MY OWN LAND WHERE I AM KNOWN TO BE TRUE OF WORD THOUGH I PERISH ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS
YOU CANNOT GO BACK SAID HALDIR STERNLY NOW YOU HAVE COME THUS FAR YOU MUST BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE LORD AND THE LADY THEY SHALL JUDGE YOU TO HOLD YOU OR TO GIVE YOU LEAVE AS THEY WILL YOU CANNOT CROSS THE RIVERS AGAIN AND BEHIND YOU THERE ARE NOW SECRET SENTINELS THAT YOU CANNOT PASS YOU WOULD BE SLAIN BEFORE YOU SAW THEM
GIMLI DREW HIS AXE FROM HIS BELT HALDIR AND HIS COMPANION BENT THEIR BOWS A PLAGUE ON DWARVES AND THEIR STIFF NECKS SAID LEGOLAS
COME SAID ARAGORN IF I AM STILL TO LEAD THIS COMPANY YOU MUST DO AS I BID IT IS HARD UPON THE DWARF TO BE THUS SINGLED OUT WE WILL ALL BE BLINDFOLD EVEN LEGOLAS THAT WILL BE BEST THOUGH IT WILL MAKE THE JOURNEY SLOW AND DULL
GIMLI LAUGHED SUDDENLY A MERRY TROOP OF FOOLS WE SHALL LOOK WILL HALDIR LEAD US ALL ON A STRING LIKE MANY BLIND BEGGARS WITH ONE DOG BUT I WILL BE CONTENT IF ONLY LEGOLAS HERE SHARES MY BLINDNESS
I AM AN ELF AND A KINSMAN HERE SAID LEGOLAS BECOMING ANGRY IN HIS TURN
NOW LET US CRY A PLAGUE ON THE STIFF NECKS OF ELVES SAID ARAGORN BUT THE COMPANY SHALL ALL FARE ALIKE COME BIND OUR EYES HALDIR
I SHALL CLAIM FULL AMENDS FOR EVERY FALL AND STUBBED TOE IF YOU DO NOT LEAD US WELL SAID GIMLI AS THEY BOUND A CLOTH ABOUT HIS EYES
YOU WILL HAVE NO CLAIM SAID HALDIR I SHALL LEAD YOU WELL AND THE PATHS ARE SMOOTH AND STRAIGHT
ALAS FOR THE FOLLY OF THESE DAYS SAID LEGOLAS HERE ALL ARE ENEMIES OF THE ONE ENEMY AND YET I MUST WALK BLIND WHILE THE SUN IS MERRY IN THE WOODLAND UNDER LEAVES OF GOLD
FOLLY IT MAY SEEM SAID HALDIR INDEED IN NOTHING IS THE POWER OF THE DARK LORD MORE CLEARLY SHOWN THAN IN THE ESTRANGEMENT THAT DIVIDES ALL THOSE WHO STILL OPPOSE HIM YET SO LITTLE FAITH AND TRUST DO WE FIND NOW IN THE WORLD BEYOND LOTHLORIEN UNLESS MAYBE IN RIVENDELL THAT WE DARE NOT BY OUR OWN TRUST ENDANGER OUR LAND WE LIVE NOW UPON AN ISLAND AMID MANY PERILS AND OUR HANDS ARE MORE OFTEN UPON THE BOWSTRING THAN UPON THE HARP
THE RIVERS LONG DEFENDED US BUT THEY ARE A SURE GUARD NO MORE FOR THE SHADOW HAS CREPT NORTHWARD ALL ABOUT US SOME SPEAK OF DEPARTING YET FOR THAT IT ALREADY SEEMS TOO LATE THE MOUNTAINS TO THE WEST ARE GROWING EVIL TO THE EAST THE LANDS ARE WASTE AND FULL OF SAURONS CREATURES AND IT IS RUMOURED THAT WE CANNOT NOW SAFELY PASS SOUTHWARD THROUGH ROHAN AND THE MOUTHS OF THE GREAT RIVER ARE WATCHED BY THE ENEMY EVEN IF WE COULD COME TO THE SHORES OF THE SEA WE SHOULD FIND NO LONGER ANY SHELTER THERE IT IS SAID THAT THERE ARE STILL HAVENS OF THE HIGH ELVES BUT THEY ARE FAR NORTH AND WEST BEYOND THE LAND OF THE HALFLINGS BUT WHERE THAT MAY BE THOUGH THE LORD AND LADY MAY KNOW I DO NOT
YOU OUGHT AT LEAST TO GUESS SINCE YOU HAVE SEEN US SAID MERRY THERE ARE ELFHAVENS WEST OF MY LAND THE SHIRE WHERE HOBBITS LIVE
HAPPY FOLK ARE HOBBITS TO DWELL NEAR THE SHORES OF THE SEA SAID HALDIR IT IS LONG INDEED SINCE ANY OF MY FOLK HAVE LOOKED ON IT YET STILL WE REMEMBER IT IN SONG TELL ME OF THESE HAVENS AS WE WALK
I CANNOT SAID MERRY I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM I HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF MY OWN LAND BEFORE AND IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT THE WORLD OUTSIDE WAS LIKE I DONT THINK I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE HEART TO LEAVE IT
NOT EVEN TO SEE FAIR LOTHLORIEN SAID HALDIR THE WORLD IS INDEED FULL OF PERIL AND IN IT THERE ARE MANY DARK PLACES BUT STILL THERE IS MUCH THAT IS FAIR AND THOUGH IN ALL LANDS LOVE IS NOW MINGLED WITH GRIEF IT GROWS PERHAPS THE GREATER
SOME THERE ARE AMONG US WHO SING THAT THE SHADOW WILL DRAW BACK AND PEACE SHALL COME AGAIN YET I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD ABOUT US WILL EVER AGAIN BE AS IT WAS OF OLD OR THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AS IT WAS AFORETIME FOR THE ELVES I FEAR IT WILL PROVE AT BEST A TRUCE IN WHICH THEY MAY PASS TO THE SEA UNHINDERED AND LEAVE THE MIDDLEEARTH FOR EVER ALAS FOR LOTHLORIEN THAT I LOVE IT WOULD BE A POOR LIFE IN A LAND WHERE NO MALLORN GREW BUT IF THERE ARE MALLORNTREES BEYOND THE GREAT SEA NONE HAVE REPORTED IT
AS THEY SPOKE THUS THE COMPANY FILED SLOWLY ALONG THE PATHS IN THE WOOD LED BY HALDIR WHILE THE OTHER ELF WALKED BEHIND THEY FELT THE GROUND BENEATH THEIR FEET SMOOTH AND SOFT AND AFTER A WHILE THEY WALKED MORE FREELY WITHOUT FEAR OF HURT OR FALL BEING DEPRIVED OF SIGHT FRODO FOUND HIS HEARING AND OTHER SENSES SHARPENED HE COULD SMELL THE TREES AND THE TRODDEN GRASS HE COULD HEAR MANY DIFFERENT NOTES IN THE RUSTLE OF THE LEAVES OVERHEAD THE RIVER MURMURING AWAY ON HIS RIGHT AND THE THIN CLEAR VOICES OF BIRDS IN THE SKY HE FELT THE SUN UPON HIS FACE AND HANDS WHEN THEY PASSED THROUGH AN OPEN GLADE
AS SOON AS HE SET FOOT UPON THE FAR BANK OF SILVERLODE A STRANGE FEELING HAD COME UPON HIM AND IT DEEPENED AS HE WALKED ON INTO THE NAITH IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD STEPPED OVER A BRIDGE OF TIME INTO A CORNER OF THE ELDER DAYS AND WAS NOW WALKING IN A WORLD THAT WAS NO MORE IN RIVENDELL THERE WAS MEMORY OF ANCIENT THINGS IN LORIEN THE ANCIENT THINGS STILL LIVED ON IN THE WAKING WORLD EVIL HAD BEEN SEEN AND HEARD THERE SORROW HAD BEEN KNOWN THE ELVES FEARED AND DISTRUSTED THE WORLD OUTSIDE WOLVES WERE HOWLING ON THE WOODS BORDERS BUT ON THE LAND OF LORIEN NO SHADOW LAY
ALL THAT DAY THE COMPANY MARCHED ON UNTIL THEY FELT THE COOL EVENING COME AND HEARD THE EARLY NIGHTWIND WHISPERING AMONG MANY LEAVES THEN THEY RESTED AND SLEPT WITHOUT FEAR UPON THE GROUND FOR THEIR GUIDES WOULD NOT PERMIT THEM TO UNBIND THEIR EYES AND THEY COULD NOT CLIMB IN THE MORNING THEY WENT ON AGAIN WALKING WITHOUT HASTE AT NOON THEY HALTED AND FRODO WAS AWARE THAT THEY HAD PASSED OUT UNDER THE SHINING SUN SUDDENLY HE HEARD THE SOUND OF MANY VOICES ALL AROUND HIM
A MARCHING HOST OF ELVES HAD COME UP SILENTLY THEY WERE HASTENING TOWARD THE NORTHERN BORDERS TO GUARD AGAINST ANY ATTACK FROM MORIA AND THEY BROUGHT NEWS SOME OF WHICH HALDIR REPORTED THE MARAUDING ORCS HAD BEEN WAYLAID AND ALMOST ALL DESTROYED THE REMNANT HAD FLED WESTWARD TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS AND WERE BEING PURSUED A STRANGE CREATURE ALSO HAD BEEN SEEN RUNNING WITH BENT BACK AND WITH HANDS NEAR THE GROUND LIKE A BEAST AND YET NOT OF BEASTSHAPE IT HAD ELUDED CAPTURE AND THEY HAD NOT SHOT IT NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT WAS GOOD OR ILL AND IT HAD VANISHED DOWN THE SILVERLODE SOUTHWARD
ALSO SAID HALDIR THEY BRING ME A MESSAGE FROM THE LORD AND LADY OF THE GALADHRIM YOU ARE ALL TO WALK FREE EVEN THE DWARF GIMLI IT SEEMS THAT THE LADY KNOWS WHO AND WHAT IS EACH MEMBER OF YOUR COMPANY NEW MESSAGES HAVE COME FROM RIVENDELL PERHAPS
HE REMOVED THE BANDAGE FIRST FROM GIMLIS EYES YOUR PARDON HE SAID BOWING LOW LOOK ON US NOW WITH FRIENDLY EYES LOOK AND BE GLAD FOR YOU ARE THE FIRST DWARF TO BEHOLD THE TREES OF THE NAITH OF LORIEN SINCE DURINS DAY
WHEN HIS EYES WERE IN TURN UNCOVERED FRODO LOOKED UP AND CAUGHT HIS BREATH THEY WERE STANDING IN AN OPEN SPACE TO THE LEFT STOOD A GREAT MOUND COVERED WITH A SWARD OF GRASS AS GREEN AS SPRINGTIME IN THE ELDER DAYS UPON IT AS A DOUBLE CROWN GREW TWO CIRCLES OF TREES THE OUTER HAD BARK OF SNOWY WHITE AND WERE LEAFLESS BUT BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR SHAPELY NAKEDNESS THE INNER WERE MALLORNTREES OF GREAT HEIGHT STILL ARRAYED IN PALE GOLD HIGH AMID THE BRANCHES OF A TOWERING TREE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF ALL THERE GLEAMED A WHITE FLET AT THE FEET OF THE TREES AND ALL ABOUT THE GREEN HILLSIDES THE GRASS WAS STUDDED WITH SMALL GOLDEN FLOWERS SHAPED LIKE STARS AMONG THEM NODDING ON SLENDER STALKS WERE OTHER FLOWERS WHITE AND PALEST GREEN THEY GLIMMERED AS A MIST AMID THE RICH HUE OF THE GRASS OVER ALL THE SKY WAS BLUE AND THE SUN OF AFTERNOON GLOWED UPON THE HILL AND CAST LONG GREEN SHADOWS BENEATH THE TREES

BEHOLD YOU ARE COME TO CERIN AMROTH SAID HALDIR FOR THIS IS THE HEART OF THE ANCIENT REALM AS IT WAS LONG AGO AND HERE IS THE MOUND OF AMROTH WHERE IN HAPPIER DAYS HIS HIGH HOUSE WAS BUILT HERE EVER BLOOM THE WINTER FLOWERS IN THE UNFADING GRASS THE YELLOW ELANOR AND THE PALE NIPHREDIL HERE WE WILL STAY AWHILE AND COME TO THE CITY OF THE GALADHRIM AT DUSK
THE OTHERS CAST THEMSELVES DOWN UPON THE FRAGRANT GRASS BUT FRODO STOOD AWHILE STILL LOST IN WONDER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD STEPPED THROUGH A HIGH WINDOW THAT LOOKED ON A VANISHED WORLD A LIGHT WAS UPON IT FOR WHICH HIS LANGUAGE HAD NO NAME ALL THAT HE SAW WAS SHAPELY BUT THE SHAPES SEEMED AT ONCE CLEAR CUT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN FIRST CONCEIVED AND DRAWN AT THE UNCOVERING OF HIS EYES AND ANCIENT AS IF THEY HAD ENDURED FOR EVER HE SAW NO COLOUR BUT THOSE HE KNEW GOLD AND WHITE AND BLUE AND GREEN BUT THEY WERE FRESH AND POIGNANT AS IF HE HAD AT THAT MOMENT FIRST PERCEIVED THEM AND MADE FOR THEM NAMES NEW AND WONDERFUL IN WINTER HERE NO HEART COULD MOURN FOR SUMMER OR FOR SPRING NO BLEMISH OR SICKNESS OR DEFORMITY COULD BE SEEN IN ANYTHING THAT GREW UPON THE EARTH ON THE LAND OF LORIEN THERE WAS NO STAIN
HE TURNED AND SAW THAT SAM WAS NOW STANDING BESIDE HIM LOOKING ROUND WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION AND RUBBING HIS EYES AS IF HE WAS NOT SURE THAT HE WAS AWAKE ITS SUNLIGHT AND BRIGHT DAY RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID I THOUGHT THAT ELVES WERE ALL FOR MOON AND STARS BUT THIS IS MORE ELVISH THAN ANYTHING I EVER HEARD TELL OF I FEEL AS IF I WAS INSIDE A SONG IF YOU TAKE MY MEANING
HALDIR LOOKED AT THEM AND HE SEEMED INDEED TO TAKE THE MEANING OF BOTH THOUGHT AND WORD HE SMILED YOU FEEL THE POWER OF THE LADY OF THE GALADHRIM HE SAID WOULD IT PLEASE YOU TO CLIMB WITH ME UP CERIN AMROTH
THEY FOLLOWED HIM AS HE STEPPED LIGHTLY UP THE GRASSCLAD SLOPES THOUGH HE WALKED AND BREATHED AND ABOUT HIM LIVING LEAVES AND FLOWERS WERE STIRRED BY THE SAME COOL WIND AS FANNED HIS FACE FRODO FELT THAT HE WAS IN A TIMELESS LAND THAT DID NOT FADE OR CHANGE OR FALL INTO FORGETFULNESS WHEN HE HAD GONE AND PASSED AGAIN INTO THE OUTER WORLD STILL FRODO THE WANDERER FROM THE SHIRE WOULD WALK THERE UPON THE GRASS AMONG ELANOR AND NIPHREDIL IN FAIR LOTHLORIEN
THEY ENTERED THE CIRCLE OF WHITE TREES AS THEY DID SO THE SOUTH WIND BLEW UPON CERIN AMROTH AND SIGHED AMONG THE BRANCHES FRODO STOOD STILL HEARING FAR OFF GREAT SEAS UPON BEACHES THAT HAD LONG AGO BEEN WASHED AWAY AND SEABIRDS CRYING WHOSE RACE HAD PERISHED FROM THE EARTH
HALDIR HAD GONE ON AND WAS NOW CLIMBING TO THE HIGH FLET AS FRODO PREPARED TO FOLLOW HIM HE LAID HIS HAND UPON THE TREE BESIDE THE LADDER NEVER BEFORE HAD HE BEEN SO SUDDENLY AND SO KEENLY AWARE OF THE FEEL AND TEXTURE OF A TREES SKIN AND OF THE LIFE WITHIN IT HE FELT A DELIGHT IN WOOD AND THE TOUCH OF IT NEITHER AS FORESTER NOR AS CARPENTER IT WAS THE DELIGHT OF THE LIVING TREE ITSELF
AS HE STEPPED OUT AT LAST UPON THE LOFTY PLATFORM HALDIR TOOK HIS HAND AND TURNED HIM TOWARD THE SOUTH LOOK THIS WAY FIRST HE SAID
FRODO LOOKED AND SAW STILL AT SOME DISTANCE A HILL OF MANY MIGHTY TREES OR A CITY OF GREEN TOWERS WHICH IT WAS HE COULD NOT TELL OUT OF IT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE POWER AND LIGHT CAME THAT HELD ALL THE LAND IN SWAY HE LONGED SUDDENLY TO FLY LIKE A BIRD TO REST IN THE GREEN CITY THEN HE LOOKED EASTWARD AND SAW ALL THE LAND OF LORIEN RUNNING DOWN TO THE PALE GLEAM OF ANDUIN THE GREAT RIVER HE LIFTED HIS EYES ACROSS THE RIVER AND ALL THE LIGHT WENT OUT AND HE WAS BACK AGAIN IN THE WORLD HE KNEW BEYOND THE RIVER THE LAND APPEARED FLAT AND EMPTY FORMLESS AND VAGUE UNTIL FAR AWAY IT ROSE AGAIN LIKE A WALL DARK AND DREAR THE SUN THAT LAY ON LOTHLORIEN HAD NO POWER TO ENLIGHTEN THE SHADOW OF THAT DISTANT HEIGHT
THERE LIES THE FASTNESS OF SOUTHERN MIRKWOOD SAID HALDIR IT IS CLAD IN A FOREST OF DARK FIR WHERE THE TREES STRIVE ONE AGAINST ANOTHER AND THEIR BRANCHES ROT AND WITHER IN THE MIDST UPON A STONY HEIGHT STANDS DOL GULDUR WHERE LONG THE HIDDEN ENEMY HAD HIS DWELLING WE FEAR THAT NOW IT IS INHABITED AGAIN AND WITH POWER SEVENFOLD A BLACK CLOUD LIES OFTEN OVER IT OF LATE IN THIS HIGH PLACE YOU MAY SEE THE TWO POWERS THAT ARE OPPOSED ONE TO ANOTHER AND EVER THEY STRIVE NOW IN THOUGHT BUT WHEREAS THE LIGHT PERCEIVES THE VERY HEART OF THE DARKNESS ITS OWN SECRET HAS NOT BEEN DISCOVERED NOT YET HE TURNED AND CLIMBED SWIFTLY DOWN AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM
AT THE HILLS FOOT FRODO FOUND ARAGORN STANDING STILL AND SILENT AS A TREE BUT IN HIS HAND WAS A SMALL GOLDEN BLOOM OF ELANOR AND A LIGHT WAS IN HIS EYES HE WAS WRAPPED IN SOME FAIR MEMORY AND AS FRODO LOOKED AT HIM HE KNEW THAT HE BEHELD THINGS AS THEY ONCE HAD BEEN IN THIS SAME PLACE FOR THE GRIM YEARS WERE REMOVED FROM THE FACE OF ARAGORN AND HE SEEMED CLOTHED IN WHITE A YOUNG LORD TALL AND FAIR AND HE SPOKE WORDS IN THE ELVISH TONGUE TO ONE WHOM FRODO COULD NOT SEE ARWEN VANIMELDA NAMARIE HE SAID AND THEN HE DREW A BREATH AND RETURNING OUT OF HIS THOUGHT HE LOOKED AT FRODO AND SMILED
HERE IS THE HEART OF ELVENDOM ON EARTH HE SAID AND HERE MY HEART DWELLS EVER UNLESS THERE BE A LIGHT BEYOND THE DARK ROADS THAT WE STILL MUST TREAD YOU AND I COME WITH ME AND TAKING FRODOS HAND IN HIS HE LEFT THE HILL OF CERIN AMROTH AND CAME THERE NEVER AGAIN AS LIVING MAN



CHAPTER 7
THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL

THE SUN WAS SINKING BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SHADOWS WERE DEEPENING IN THE WOODS WHEN THEY WENT ON AGAIN THEIR PATHS NOW WENT INTO THICKETS WHERE THE DUSK HAD ALREADY GATHERED NIGHT CAME BENEATH THE TREES AS THEY WALKED AND THE ELVES UNCOVERED THEIR SILVER LAMPS
SUDDENLY THEY CAME OUT INTO THE OPEN AGAIN AND FOUND THEMSELVES UNDER A PALE EVENING SKY PRICKED BY A FEW EARLY STARS THERE WAS A WIDE TREELESS SPACE BEFORE THEM RUNNING IN A GREAT CIRCLE AND BENDING AWAY ON EITHER HAND BEYOND IT WAS A DEEP FOSSE LOST IN SOFT SHADOW BUT THE GRASS UPON ITS BRINK WAS GREEN AS IF IT GLOWED STILL IN MEMORY OF THE SUN THAT HAD GONE UPON THE FURTHER SIDE THERE ROSE TO A GREAT HEIGHT A GREEN WALL ENCIRCLING A GREEN HILL THRONGED WITH MALLORNTREES TALLER THAN ANY THEY HAD YET SEEN IN ALL THE LAND THEIR HEIGHT COULD NOT BE GUESSED BUT THEY STOOD UP IN THE TWILIGHT LIKE LIVING TOWERS IN THEIR MANYTIERED BRANCHES AND AMID THEIR EVERMOVING LEAVES COUNTLESS LIGHTS WERE GLEAMING GREEN AND GOLD AND SILVER HALDIR TURNED TOWARDS THE COMPANY
WELCOME TO CARAS GALADHON HE SAID HERE IS THE CITY OF THE GALADHRIM WHERE DWELL THE LORD CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL THE LADY OF LORIEN BUT WE CANNOT ENTER HERE FOR THE GATES DO NOT LOOK NORTHWARD WE MUST GO ROUND TO THE SOUTHERN SIDE AND THE WAY IS NOT SHORT FOR THE CITY IS GREAT
THERE WAS A ROAD PAVED WITH WHITE STONE RUNNING ON THE OUTER BRINK OF THE FOSSE ALONG THIS THEY WENT WESTWARD WITH THE CITY EVER CLIMBING UP LIKE A GREEN CLOUD UPON THEIR LEFT AND AS THE NIGHT DEEPENED MORE LIGHTS SPRANG FORTH UNTIL ALL THE HILL SEEMED AFIRE WITH STARS THEY CAME AT LAST TO A WHITE BRIDGE AND CROSSING FOUND THE GREAT GATES OF THE CITY THEY FACED SOUTHWEST SET BETWEEN THE ENDS OF THE ENCIRCLING WALL THAT HERE OVERLAPPED AND THEY WERE TALL AND STRONG AND HUNG WITH MANY LAMPS
HALDIR KNOCKED AND SPOKE AND THE GATES OPENED SOUNDLESSLY BUT OF GUARDS FRODO COULD SEE NO SIGN THE TRAVELLERS PASSED WITHIN AND THE GATES SHUT BEHIND THEM THEY WERE IN A DEEP LANE BETWEEN THE ENDS OF THE WALL AND PASSING QUICKLY THROUGH IT THEY ENTERED THE CITY OF THE TREES NO FOLK COULD THEY SEE NOR HEAR ANY FEET UPON THE PATHS BUT THERE WERE MANY VOICES ABOUT THEM AND IN THE AIR ABOVE FAR AWAY UP ON THE HILL THEY COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF SINGING FALLING FROM ON HIGH LIKE SOFT RAIN UPON LEAVES
THEY WENT ALONG MANY PATHS AND CLIMBED MANY STAIRS UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE HIGH PLACES AND SAW BEFORE THEM AMID A WIDE LAWN A FOUNTAIN SHIMMERING IT WAS LIT BY SILVER LAMPS THAT SWUNG FROM THE BOUGHS OF TREES AND IT FELL INTO A BASIN OF SILVER FROM WHICH A WHITE STREAM SPILLED UPON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LAWN THERE STOOD THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL THE TREES ITS GREAT SMOOTH BOLE GLEAMED LIKE GREY SILK AND UP IT TOWERED UNTIL ITS FIRST BRANCHES FAR ABOVE OPENED THEIR HUGE LIMBS UNDER SHADOWY CLOUDS OF LEAVES BESIDE IT A BROAD WHITE LADDER STOOD AND AT ITS FOOT THREE ELVES WERE SEATED THEY SPRANG UP AS THE TRAVELLERS APPROACHED AND FRODO SAW THAT THEY WERE TALL AND CLAD IN GREY MAIL AND FROM THEIR SHOULDERS HUNG LONG WHITE CLOAKS
HERE DWELL CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL SAID HALDIR IT IS THEIR WISH THAT YOU SHOULD ASCEND AND SPEAK WITH THEM
ONE OF THE ELFWARDENS THEN BLEW A CLEAR NOTE ON A SMALL HORN AND IT WAS ANSWERED THREE TIMES FROM FAR ABOVE I WILL GO FIRST SAID HALDIR LET FRODO COME NEXT AND WITH HIM LEGOLAS THE OTHERS MAY FOLLOW AS THEY WISH IT IS A LONG CLIMB FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH STAIRS BUT YOU MAY REST UPON THE WAY
AS HE CLIMBED SLOWLY UP FRODO PASSED MANY FLETS SOME ON ONE SIDE SOME ON ANOTHER AND SOME SET ABOUT THE BOLE OF THE TREE SO THAT THE LADDER PASSED THROUGH THEM AT A GREAT HEIGHT ABOVE THE GROUND HE CAME TO A WIDE TALAN LIKE THE DECK OF A GREAT SHIP ON IT WAS BUILT A HOUSE SO LARGE THAT ALMOST IT WOULD HAVE SERVED FOR A HALL OF MEN UPON THE EARTH HE ENTERED BEHIND HALDIR AND FOUND THAT HE WAS IN A CHAMBER OF OVAL SHAPE IN THE MIDST OF WHICH GREW THE TRUNK OF THE GREAT MALLORN NOW TAPERING TOWARDS ITS CROWN AND YET MAKING STILL A PILLAR OF WIDE GIRTH
THE CHAMBER WAS FILLED WITH A SOFT LIGHT ITS WALLS WERE GREEN AND SILVER AND ITS ROOF OF GOLD MANY ELVES WERE SEATED THERE ON TWO CHAIRS BENEATH THE BOLE OF THE TREE AND CANOPIED BY A LIVING BOUGH THERE SAT SIDE BY SIDE CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL THEY STOOD UP TO GREET THEIR GUESTS AFTER THE MANNER OF ELVES EVEN THOSE WHO WERE ACCOUNTED MIGHTY KINGS VERY TALL THEY WERE AND THE LADY NO LESS TALL THAN THE LORD AND THEY WERE GRAVE AND BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE CLAD WHOLLY IN WHITE AND THE HAIR OF THE LADY WAS OF DEEP GOLD AND THE HAIR OF THE LORD CELEBORN WAS OF SILVER LONG AND BRIGHT BUT NO SIGN OF AGE WAS UPON THEM UNLESS IT WERE IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR EYES FOR THESE WERE KEEN AS LANCES IN THE STARLIGHT AND YET PROFOUND THE WELLS OF DEEP MEMORY
HALDIR LED FRODO BEFORE THEM AND THE LORD WELCOMED HIM IN HIS OWN TONGUE THE LADY GALADRIEL SAID NO WORD BUT LOOKED LONG UPON HIS FACE
SIT NOW BESIDE MY CHAIR FRODO OF THE SHIRE SAID CELEBORN WHEN ALL HAVE COME WE WILL SPEAK TOGETHER
EACH OF THE COMPANIONS HE GREETED COURTEOUSLY BY NAME AS THEY ENTERED WELCOME ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN HE SAID IT IS EIGHT AND THIRTY YEARS OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE SINCE YOU CAME TO THIS LAND AND THOSE YEARS LIE HEAVY ON YOU BUT THE END IS NEAR FOR GOOD OR ILL HERE LAY ASIDE YOUR BURDEN FOR A WHILE
WELCOME SON OF THRANDUIL TOO SELDOM DO MY KINDRED JOURNEY HITHER FROM THE NORTH
WELCOME GIMLI SON OF GLOIN IT IS LONG INDEED SINCE WE SAW ONE OF DURINS FOLK IN CARAS GALADHON BUT TODAY WE HAVE BROKEN OUR LONG LAW MAY IT BE A SIGN THAT THOUGH THE WORLD IS NOW DARK BETTER DAYS ARE AT HAND AND THAT FRIENDSHIP SHALL BE RENEWED BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES GIMLI BOWED LOW
WHEN ALL THE GUESTS WERE SEATED BEFORE HIS CHAIR THE LORD LOOKED AT THEM AGAIN HERE THERE ARE EIGHT HE SAID NINE WERE TO SET OUT SO SAID THE MESSAGES BUT MAYBE THERE HAS BEEN SOME CHANGE OF COUNSEL THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD ELROND IS FAR AWAY AND DARKNESS GATHERS BETWEEN US AND ALL THIS YEAR THE SHADOWS HAVE GROWN LONGER
NAY THERE WAS NO CHANGE OF COUNSEL SAID THE LADY GALADRIEL SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME HER VOICE WAS CLEAR AND MUSICAL BUT DEEPER THAN WOMANS WONT GANDALF THE GREY SET OUT WITH THE COMPANY BUT HE DID NOT PASS THE BORDERS OF THIS LAND NOW TELL US WHERE HE IS FOR I MUCH DESIRED TO SPEAK WITH HIM AGAIN BUT I CANNOT SEE HIM FROM AFAR UNLESS HE COMES WITHIN THE FENCES OF LOTHLORIEN A GREY MIST IS ABOUT HIM AND THE WAYS OF HIS FEET AND OF HIS MIND ARE HIDDEN FROM ME
ALAS SAID ARAGORN GANDALF THE GREY FELL INTO SHADOW HE REMAINED IN MORIA AND DID NOT ESCAPE
AT THESE WORDS ALL THE ELVES IN THE HALL CRIED ALOUD IN GRIEF AND AMAZEMENT THESE ARE EVIL TIDINGS SAID CELEBORN THE MOST EVIL THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN HERE IN LONG YEARS FULL OF GRIEVOUS DEEDS HE TURNED TO HALDIR WHY HAS NOTHING OF THIS BEEN TOLD TO ME BEFORE HE ASKED IN THE ELVENTONGUE
WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO HALDIR OF OUR DEEDS OR OUR PURPOSE SAID LEGOLAS AT FIRST WE WERE WEARY AND DANGER WAS TOO CLOSE BEHIND AND AFTERWARDS WE ALMOST FORGOT OUR GRIEF FOR A TIME AS WE WALKED IN GLADNESS ON THE FAIR PATHS OF LORIEN
YET OUR GRIEF IS GREAT AND OUR LOSS CANNOT BE MENDED SAID FRODO GANDALF WAS OUR GUIDE AND HE LED US THROUGH MORIA AND WHEN OUR ESCAPE SEEMED BEYOND HOPE HE SAVED US AND HE FELL
TELL US NOW THE FULL TALE SAID CELEBORN
THEN ARAGORN RECOUNTED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED UPON THE PASS OF CARADHRAS AND IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED AND HE SPOKE OF BALIN AND HIS BOOK AND THE FIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF MAZARBUL AND THE FIRE AND THE NARROW BRIDGE AND THE COMING OF THE TERROR AN EVIL OF THE ANCIENT WORLD IT SEEMED SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE SAID ARAGORN IT WAS BOTH A SHADOW AND A FLAME STRONG AND TERRIBLE
IT WAS A BALROG OF MORGOTH SAID LEGOLAS OF ALL ELFBANES THE MOST DEADLY SAVE THE ONE WHO SITS IN THE DARK TOWER
INDEED I SAW UPON THE BRIDGE THAT WHICH HAUNTS OUR DARKEST DREAMS I SAW DURINS BANE SAID GIMLI IN A LOW VOICE AND DREAD WAS IN HIS EYES
ALAS SAID CELEBORN WE LONG HAVE FEARED THAT UNDER CARADHRAS A TERROR SLEPT BUT HAD I KNOWN THAT THE DWARVES HAD STIRRED UP THIS EVIL IN MORIA AGAIN L WOULD HAVE FORBIDDEN YOU TO PASS THE NORTHERN BORDERS YOU AND ALL THAT WENT WITH YOU AND IF IT WERE POSSIBLE ONE WOULD SAY THAT AT THE LAST GANDALF FELL FROM WISDOM INTO FOLLY GOING NEEDLESSLY INTO THE NET OF MORIA
HE WOULD BE RASH INDEED THAT SAID THAT THING SAID GALADRIEL GRAVELY NEEDLESS WERE NONE OF THE DEEDS OF GANDALF IN LIFE THOSE THAT FOLLOWED HIM KNEW NOT HIS MIND AND CANNOT REPORT HIS FULL PURPOSE BUT HOWEVER IT MAY BE WITH THE GUIDE THE FOLLOWERS ARE BLAMELESS DO NOT REPENT OF YOUR WELCOME TO THE DWARF IF OUR FOLK HAD BEEN EXILED LONG AND FAR FROM LOTHLORIEN WHO OF THE GALADHRIM EVEN CELEBORN THE WISE WOULD PASS NIGH AND WOULD NOT WISH TO LOOK UPON THEIR ANCIENT HOME THOUGH IT HAD BECOME AN ABODE OF DRAGONS
DARK IS THE WATER OF KHELEDZARAM AND COLD ARE THE SPRINGS OF KIBILNALA AND FAIR WERE THE MANYPILLARED HALLS OF KHAZADDUM IN ELDER DAYS BEFORE THE FALL OF MIGHTY KINGS BENEATH THE STONE SHE LOOKED UPON GIMLI WHO SAT GLOWERING AND SAD AND SHE SMILED AND THE DWARF HEARING THE NAMES GIVEN IN HIS OWN ANCIENT TONGUE LOOKED UP AND MET HER EYES AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE LOOKED SUDDENLY INTO THE HEART OF AN ENEMY AND SAW THERE LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING WONDER CAME INTO HIS FACE AND THEN HE SMILED IN ANSWER
HE ROSE CLUMSILY AND BOWED IN DWARFFASHION SAYING YET MORE FAIR IS THE LIVING LAND OF LORIEN AND THE LADY GALADRIEL IS ABOVE ALL THE JEWELS THAT LIE BENEATH THE EARTH
THERE WAS A SILENCE AT LENGTH CELEBORN SPOKE AGAIN I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOUR PLIGHT WAS SO EVIL HE SAID LET GIMLI FORGET MY HARSH WORDS I SPOKE IN THE TROUBLE OF MY HEART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO AID YOU EACH ACCORDING TO HIS WISH AND NEED BUT ESPECIALLY THAT ONE OF THE LITTLE FOLK WHO BEARS THE BURDEN
YOUR QUEST IS KNOWN TO US SAID GALADRIEL LOOKING AT FRODO BUT WE WILL NOT HERE SPEAK OF IT MORE OPENLY YET NOT IN VAIN WILL IT PROVE MAYBE THAT YOU CAME TO THIS LAND SEEKING AID AS GANDALF HIMSELF PLAINLY PURPOSED FOR THE LORD OF THE GALADHRIM IS ACCOUNTED THE WISEST OF THE ELVES OF MIDDLEEARTH AND A GIVER OF GIFTS BEYOND THE POWER OF KINGS HE HAS DWELT IN THE WEST SINCE THE DAYS OF DAWN AND I HAVE DWELT WITH HIM YEARS UNCOUNTED FOR ERE THE FALL OF NARGOTHROND OR GONDOLIN I PASSED OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND TOGETHER THROUGH AGES OF THE WORLD WE HAVE FOUGHT THE LONG DEFEAT
I IT WAS WHO FIRST SUMMONED THE WHITE COUNCIL AND IF MY DESIGNS HAD NOT GONE AMISS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOVERNED BY GANDALF THE GREY AND THEN MAYHAP THINGS WOULD HAVE GONE OTHERWISE BUT EVEN NOW THERE IS HOPE LEFT I WILL NOT GIVE YOU COUNSEL SAYING DO THIS OR DO THAT FOR NOT IN DOING OR CONTRIVING NOR IN CHOOSING BETWEEN THIS COURSE AND ANOTHER CAN I AVAIL BUT ONLY IN KNOWING WHAT WAS AND IS AND IN PART ALSO WHAT SHALL BE BUT THIS I WILL SAY TO YOU YOUR QUEST STANDS UPON THE EDGE OF A KNIFE STRAY BUT A LITTLE AND IT WILL FAIL TO THE RUIN OF ALL YET HOPE REMAINS WHILE ALL THE COMPANY IS TRUE
AND WITH THAT WORD SHE HELD THEM WITH HER EYES AND IN SILENCE LOOKED SEARCHINGLY AT EACH OF THEM IN TURN NONE SAVE LEGOLAS AND ARAGORN COULD LONG ENDURE HER GLANCE SAM QUICKLY BLUSHED AND HUNG HIS HEAD
AT LENGTH THE LADY GALADRIEL RELEASED THEM FROM HER EYES AND SHE SMILED DO NOT LET YOUR HEARTS BE TROUBLED SHE SAID TONIGHT YOU SHALL SLEEP IN PEACE THEN THEY SIGHED AND FELT SUDDENLY WEARY AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED LONG AND DEEPLY THOUGH NO WORDS HAD BEEN SPOKEN OPENLY
GO NOW SAID CELEBORN YOU ARE WORN WITH SORROW AND MUCH TOIL EVEN IF YOUR QUEST DID NOT CONCERN US CLOSELY YOU SHOULD HAVE REFUGE IN THIS CITY UNTIL YOU WERE HEALED AND REFRESHED NOW YOU SHALL REST AND WE WILL NOT SPEAK OF YOUR FURTHER ROAD FOR A WHILE
THAT NIGHT THE COMPANY SLEPT UPON THE GROUND MUCH TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE HOBBITS THE ELVES SPREAD FOR THEM A PAVILION AMONG THE TREES NEAR THE FOUNTAIN AND IN IT THEY LAID SOFT COUCHES THEN SPEAKING WORDS OF PEACE WITH FAIR ELVISH VOICES THEY LEFT THEM FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE TRAVELLERS TALKED OF THEIR NIGHT BEFORE IN THE TREETOPS AND OF THEIR DAYS JOURNEY AND OF THE LORD AND LADY FOR THEY HAD NOT YET THE HEART TO LOOK FURTHER BACK
WHAT DID YOU BLUSH FOR SAM SAID PIPPIN YOU SOON BROKE DOWN ANYONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD A GUILTY CONSCIENCE I HOPE IT WAS NOTHING WORSE THAN A WICKED PLOT TO STEAL ONE OF MY BLANKETS
I NEVER THOUGHT NO SUCH THING ANSWERED SAM IN NO MOOD FOR JEST IF YOU WANT TO KNOW I FELT AS IF I HADNT GOT NOTHING ON AND I DIDNT LIKE IT SHE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING INSIDE ME AND ASKING ME WHAT I WOULD DO IF SHE GAVE ME THE CHANCE OF FLYING BACK HOME TO THE SHIRE TO A NICE LITTLE HOLE WITH  WITH A BIT OF GARDEN OF MY OWN
THATS FUNNY SAID MERRY ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT I FELT MYSELF ONLY ONLY WELL I DONT THINK ILL SAY ANY MORE HE ENDED LAMELY
ALL OF THEM IT SEEMED HAD FARED ALIKE EACH HAD FELT THAT HE WAS OFFERED A CHOICE BETWEEN A SHADOW FULL OF FEAR THAT LAY AHEAD AND SOMETHING THAT HE GREATLY DESIRED CLEAR BEFORE HIS MIND IT LAY AND TO GET IT HE HAD ONLY TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE ROAD AND LEAVE THE QUEST AND THE WAR AGAINST SAURON TO OTHERS
AND IT SEEMED TO ME TOO SAID GIMLI THAT MY CHOICE WOULD REMAIN SECRET AND KNOWN ONLY TO MYSELF
TO ME IT SEEMED EXCEEDINGLY STRANGE SAID BOROMIR MAYBE IT WAS ONLY A TEST AND SHE THOUGHT TO READ OUR THOUGHTS FOR HER OWN GOOD PURPOSE BUT ALMOST I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT SHE WAS TEMPTING US AND OFFERING WHAT SHE PRETENDED TO HAVE THE POWER TO GIVE IT NEED NOT BE SAID THAT I REFUSED TO LISTEN THE MEN OF MINAS TIRITH ARE TRUE TO THEIR WORD BUT WHAT HE THOUGHT THAT THE LADY HAD OFFERED HIM BOROMIR DID NOT TELL
AND AS FOR FRODO HE WOULD NOT SPEAK THOUGH BOROMIR PRESSED HIM WITH QUESTIONS SHE HELD YOU LONG IN HER GAZE RINGBEARER HE SAID
YES SAID FRODO BUT WHATEVER CAME INTO MY MIND THEN I WILL KEEP THERE
WELL HAVE A CARE SAID BOROMIR I DO NOT FEEL TOO SURE OF THIS ELVISH LADY AND HER PURPOSES
SPEAK NO EVIL OF THE LADY GALADRIEL SAID ARAGORN STERNLY YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU SAY THERE IS IN HER AND IN THIS LAND NO EVIL UNLESS A MAN BRING IT HITHER HIMSELF THEN LET HIM BEWARE BUT TONIGHT I SHALL SLEEP WITHOUT FEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I LEFT RIVENDELL AND MAY I SLEEP DEEP AND FORGET FOR A WHILE MY GRIEF I AM WEARY IN BODY AND IN HEART HE CAST HIMSELF DOWN UPON HIS COUCH AND FELL AT ONCE INTO A LONG SLEEP
THE OTHERS SOON DID THE SAME AND NO SOUND OR DREAM DISTURBED THEIR SLUMBER WHEN THEY WOKE THEY FOUND THAT THE LIGHT OF DAY WAS BROAD UPON THE LAWN BEFORE THE PAVILION AND THE FOUNTAIN ROSE AND FELL GLITTERING IN THE SUN
THEY REMAINED SOME DAYS IN LOTHLORIEN SO FAR AS THEY COULD TELL OR REMEMBER ALL THE WHILE THAT THEY DWELT THERE THE SUN SHONE CLEAR SAVE FOR A GENTLE RAIN THAT FELL AT TIMES AND PASSED AWAY LEAVING ALL THINGS FRESH AND CLEAN THE AIR WAS COOL AND SOFT AS IF IT WERE EARLY SPRING YET THEY FELT ABOUT THEM THE DEEP AND THOUGHTFUL QUIET OF WINTER IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEY DID LITTLE BUT EAT AND DRINK AND REST AND WALK AMONG THE TREES AND IT WAS ENOUGH
THEY HAD NOT SEEN THE LORD AND LADY AGAIN AND THEY HAD LITTLE SPEECH WITH THE ELVENFOLK FOR FEW OF THESE KNEW OR WOULD USE THE WESTRON TONGUE HALDIR HAD BIDDEN THEM FAREWELL AND GONE BACK AGAIN TO THE FENCES OF THE NORTH WHERE GREAT WATCH WAS NOW KEPT SINCE THE TIDINGS OF MORIA THAT THE COMPANY HAD BROUGHT LEGOLAS WAS AWAY MUCH AMONG THE GALADHRIM AND AFTER THE FIRST NIGHT HE DID NOT SLEEP WITH THE OTHER COMPANIONS THOUGH HE RETURNED TO EAT AND TALK WITH THEM OFTEN HE TOOK GIMLI WITH HIM WHEN HE WENT ABROAD IN THE LAND AND THE OTHERS WONDERED AT THIS CHANGE
NOW AS THE COMPANIONS SAT OR WALKED TOGETHER THEY SPOKE OF GANDALF AND ALL THAT EACH HAD KNOWN AND SEEN OF HIM CAME CLEAR BEFORE THEIR MINDS AS THEY WERE HEALED OF HURT AND WEARINESS OF BODY THE GRIEF OF THEIR LOSS GREW MORE KEEN OFTEN THEY HEARD NEARBY ELVISH VOICES SINGING AND KNEW THAT THEY WERE MAKING SONGS OF LAMENTATION FOR HIS FALL FOR THEY CAUGHT HIS NAME AMONG THE SWEET SAD WORDS THAT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
MITHRANDIR MITHRANDIR SANG THE ELVES O PILGRIM GREY FOR SO THEY LOVED TO CALL HIM BUT IF LEGOLAS WAS WITH THE COMPANY HE WOULD NOT INTERPRET THE SONGS FOR THEM SAYING THAT HE HAD NOT THE SKILL AND THAT FOR HIM THE GRIEF WAS STILL TOO NEAR A MATTER FOR TEARS AND NOT YET FOR SONG
IT WAS FRODO WHO FIRST PUT SOMETHING OF HIS SORROW INTO HALTING WORDS HE WAS SELDOM MOVED TO MAKE SONG OR RHYME EVEN IN RIVENDELL HE HAD LISTENED AND HAD NOT SUNG HIMSELF THOUGH HIS MEMORY WAS STORED WITH MANY THINGS THAT OTHERS HAD MADE BEFORE HIM BUT NOW AS HE SAT BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN IN LORIEN AND HEARD ABOUT HIM THE VOICES OF THE ELVES HIS THOUGHT TOOK SHAPE IN A SONG THAT SEEMED FAIR TO HIM YET WHEN HE TRIED TO REPEAT IT TO SAM ONLY SNATCHES REMAINED FADED AS A HANDFUL OF WITHERED LEAVES
WHEN EVENING IN THE SHIRE WAS GREY
HIS FOOTSTEPS ON THE HILL WERE HEARD
BEFORE THE DAWN HE WENT AWAY
ON JOURNEY LONG WITHOUT A WORD

FROM WILDERLAND TO WESTERN SHORE
FROM NORTHERN WASTE TO SOUTHERN HILL
THROUGH DRAGONLAIR AND HIDDEN DOOR
AND DARKLING WOODS HE WALKED AT WILL

WITH DWARF AND HOBBIT ELVES AND MEN
WITH MORTAL AND IMMORTAL FOLK
WITH BIRD ON BOUGH AND BEAST IN DEN
IN THEIR OWN SECRET TONGUES HE SPOKE

ADEADLY SWORD A HEALING HAND
A BACK THAT BENT BENEATH ITS LOAD
A TRUMPETVOICE A BURNING BRAND
A WEARY PILGRIM ON THE ROAD

A LORD OF WISDOM THRONED HE SAT
SWIFT IN ANGER QUICK TO LAUGH
AN OLD MAN IN A BATTERED HAT
WHO LEANED UPON A THORNY STAFF

HE STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE ALONE
AND FIRE AND SHADOW BOTH DEFIED
HIS STAFF WAS BROKEN ON THE STONE
IN KHAZADDUM HIS WISDOM DIED

WHY YOULL BE BEATING MR BILBO NEXT SAID SAM
NO I AM AFRAID NOT SAID FRODO BUT THAT IS THE BEST I CAN DO YET
WELL MR FRODO IF YOU DO HAVE ANOTHER GO I HOPE YOULL SAY A WORD ABOUT HIS FIREWORKS SAID SAM SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THE FINEST ROCKETS EVER SEEN
THEY BURST IN STARS OF BLUE AND GREEN
OR AFTER THUNDER GOLDEN SHOWERS
CAME FALLING LIKE A RAIN OF FLOWERS

THOUGH THAT DOESNT DO THEM JUSTICE BY A LONG ROAD
NO ILL LEAVE THAT TO YOU SAM OR PERHAPS TO BILBO BUT  WELL I CANT TALK OF IT ANY MORE I CANT BEAR TO THINK OF BRINGING THE NEWS TO HIM
ONE EVENING FRODO AND SAM WERE WALKING TOGETHER IN THE COOL TWILIGHT BOTH OF THEM FELT RESTLESS AGAIN ON FRODO SUDDENLY THE SHADOW OF PARTING HAD FALLEN HE KNEW SOMEHOW THAT THE TIME WAS VERY NEAR WHEN HE MUST LEAVE LOTHLORIEN
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ELVES NOW SAM HE SAID I ASKED YOU THE SAME QUESTION ONCE BEFORE  IT SEEMS A VERY LONG WHILE AGO BUT YOU HAVE SEEN MORE OF THEM SINCE THEN
I HAVE INDEED SAID SAM AND I RECKON THERES ELVES AND ELVES THEYRE ALL ELVISH ENOUGH BUT THEYRE NOT ALL THE SAME NOW THESE FOLK ARENT WANDERERS OR HOMELESS AND SEEM A BIT NEARER TO THE LIKES OF US THEY SEEM TO BELONG HERE MORE EVEN THAN HOBBITS DO IN THE SHIRE WHETHER THEYVE MADE THE LAND OR THE LANDS MADE THEM ITS HARD TO SAY IF YOU TAKE MY MEANING ITS WONDERFULLY QUIET HERE NOTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING ON AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT IT TO IF THERES ANY MAGIC ABOUT ITS RIGHT DOWN DEEP WHERE I CANT LAY MY HANDS ON IT IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING
YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL IT EVERYWHERE SAID FRODO
WELL SAID SAM YOU CANT SEE NOBODY WORKING IT NO FIREWORKS LIKE POOR GANDALF USED TO SHOW I WONDER WE DONT SEE NOTHING OF THE LORD AND LADY IN ALL THESE DAYS I FANCY NOW THAT SHE COULD DO SOME WONDERFUL THINGS IF SHE HAD A MIND ID DEARLY LOVE TO SEE SOME ELFMAGIC MR FRODO
I WOULDNT SAID FRODO I AM CONTENT AND I DONT MISS GANDALFS FIREWORKS BUT HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS AND HIS QUICK TEMPER AND HIS VOICE
YOURE RIGHT SAID SAM AND DONT THINK IM FINDING FAULT IVE OFTEN WANTED TO SEE A BIT OF MAGIC LIKE WHAT IT TELLS OF IN OLD TALES BUT IVE NEVER HEARD OF A BETTER LAND THAN THIS ITS LIKE BEING AT HOME AND ON A HOLIDAY AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME I DONT WANT TO LEAVE ALL THE SAME IM BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT IF WEVE GOT TO GO ON THEN WED BEST GET IT OVER
ITS THE JOB THATS NEVER STARTED AS TAKES LONGEST TO FINISH AS MY OLD GAFFER USED TO SAY AND I DONT RECKON THAT THESE FOLK CAN DO MUCH MORE TO HELP US MAGIC OR NO ITS WHEN WE LEAVE THIS LAND THAT WE SHALL MISS GANDALF WORSE IM THINKING
I AM AFRAID THATS ONLY TOO TRUE SAM SAID FRODO YET I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT BEFORE WE LEAVE WE SHALL SEE THE LADY OF THE ELVES AGAIN
EVEN AS HE SPOKE THEY SAW AS IF SHE CAME IN ANSWER TO THEIR WORDS THE LADY GALADRIEL APPROACHING TALL AND WHITE AND FAIR SHE WALKED BENEATH THE TREES SHE SPOKE NO WORD BUT BECKONED TO THEM
TURNING ASIDE SHE LED THEM TOWARD THE SOUTHERN SLOPES OF THE HILL OF CARAS GALADHON AND PASSING THROUGH A HIGH GREEN HEDGE THEY CAME INTO AN ENCLOSED GARDEN NO TREES GREW THERE AND IT LAY OPEN TO THE SKY THE EVENING STAR HAD RISEN AND WAS SHINING WITH WHITE FIRE ABOVE THE WESTERN WOODS DOWN A LONG FLIGHT OF STEPS THE LADY WENT INTO A DEEP GREEN HOLLOW THROUGH WHICH RAN MURMURING THE SILVER STREAM THAT ISSUED FROM THE FOUNTAIN ON THE HILL AT THE BOTTOM UPON A LOW PEDESTAL CARVED LIKE A BRANCHING TREE STOOD A BASIN OF SILVER WIDE AND SHALLOW AND BESIDE IT STOOD A SILVER EWER
WITH WATER FROM THE STREAM GALADRIEL FILLED THE BASIN TO THE BRIM AND BREATHED ON IT AND WHEN THE WATER WAS STILL AGAIN SHE SPOKE HERE IS THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL SHE SAID I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE SO THAT YOU MAY LOOK IN IT IF YOU WILL
THE AIR WAS VERY STILL AND THE DELL WAS DARK AND THE ELFLADY BESIDE HIM WAS TALL AND PALE WHAT SHALL WE LOOK FOR AND WHAT SHALL WE SEE ASKED FRODO FILLED WITH AWE
MANY THINGS I CAN COMMAND THE MIRROR TO REVEAL SHE ANSWERED AND TO SOME I CAN SHOW WHAT THEY DESIRE TO SEE BUT THE MIRROR WILL ALSO SHOW THINGS UNBIDDEN AND THOSE ARE OFTEN STRANGER AND MORE PROFITABLE THAN THINGS WHICH WE WISH TO BEHOLD WHAT YOU WILL SEE IF YOU LEAVE THE MIRROR FREE TO WORK I CANNOT TELL FOR IT SHOWS THINGS THAT WERE AND THINGS THAT ARE THINGS THAT YET MAY BE BUT WHICH IT IS THAT HE SEES EVEN THE WISEST CANNOT ALWAYS TELL DO YOU WISH TO LOOK
FRODO DID NOT ANSWER
AND YOU SHE SAID TURNING TO SAM FOR THIS IS WHAT YOUR FOLK WOULD CALL MAGIC I BELIEVE THOUGH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND CLEARLY WHAT THEY MEAN AND THEY SEEM ALSO TO USE THE SAME WORD OF THE DECEITS OF THE ENEMY BUT THIS IF YOU WILL IS THE MAGIC OF GALADRIEL DID YOU NOT SAY THAT YOU WISHED TO SEE ELFMAGIC
I DID SAID SAM TREMBLING A LITTLE BETWEEN FEAR AND CURIOSITY ILL HAVE A PEEP LADY IF YOURE WILLING
AND ID NOT MIND A GLIMPSE OF WHATS GOING ON AT HOME HE SAID IN AN ASIDE TO FRODO IT SEEMS A TERRIBLE LONG TIME THAT IVE BEEN AWAY BUT THERE LIKE AS NOT ILL ONLY SEE THE STARS OR SOMETHING THAT I WONT UNDERSTAND
LIKE AS NOT SAID THE LADY WITH A GENTLE LAUGH BUT COME YOU SHALL LOOK AND SEE WHAT YOU MAY DO NOT TOUCH THE WATER
SAM CLIMBED UP ON THE FOOT OF THE PEDESTAL AND LEANED OVER THE BASIN THE WATER LOOKED HARD AND DARK STARS WERE REFLECTED IN IT
THERES ONLY STARS AS I THOUGHT HE SAID THEN HE GAVE A LOW GASP FOR THE STARS WENT OUT AS IF A DARK VEIL HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN THE MIRROR GREW GREY AND THEN CLEAR THERE WAS SUN SHINING AND THE BRANCHES OF TREES WERE WAVING AND TOSSING IN THE WIND BUT BEFORE SAM COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND WHAT IT WAS THAT HE SAW THE LIGHT FADED AND NOW HE THOUGHT HE SAW FRODO WITH A PALE FACE LYING FAST ASLEEP UNDER A GREAT DARK CLIFF THEN HE SEEMED TO SEE HIMSELF GOING ALONG A DIM PASSAGE AND CLIMBING AN ENDLESS WINDING STAIR IT CAME TO HIM SUDDENLY THAT HE WAS LOOKING URGENTLY FOR SOMETHING BUT WHAT IT WAS HE DID NOT KNOW LIKE A DREAM THE VISION SHIFTED AND WENT BACK AND HE SAW THE TREES AGAIN BUT THIS TIME THEY WERE NOT SO CLOSE AND HE COULD SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY WERE NOT WAVING IN THE WIND THEY WERE FALLING CRASHING TO THE GROUND
HI CRIED SAM IN AN OUTRAGED VOICE THERES THAT TED SANDYMAN ACUTTING DOWN TREES AS HE SHOULDNT THEY DIDNT OUGHT TO BE FELLED ITS THAT AVENUE BEYOND THE MILL THAT SHADES THE ROAD TO BYWATER I WISH I COULD GET AT TED AND ID FELL HIM
BUT NOW SAM NOTICED THAT THE OLD MILL HAD VANISHED AND A LARGE REDBRICK BUILDING WAS BEING PUT UP WHERE IT HAD STOOD LOTS OF FOLK WERE BUSILY AT WORK THERE WAS A TALL RED CHIMNEY NEARBY BLACK SMOKE SEEMED TO CLOUD THE SURFACE OF THE MIRROR
THERES SOME DEVILRY AT WORK IN THE SHIRE HE SAID ELROND KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT WHEN HE WANTED TO SEND MR MERRY BACK THEN SUDDENLY SAM GAVE A CRY AND SPRANG AWAY I CANT STAY HERE HE SAID WILDLY I MUST GO HOME THEYVE DUG UP BAGSHOT ROW AND THERES THE POOR OLD GAFFER GOING DOWN THE HILL WITH HIS BITS OF THINGS ON A BARROW I MUST GO HOME
YOU CANNOT GO HOME ALONE SAID THE LADY YOU DID NOT WISH TO GO HOME WITHOUT YOUR MASTER BEFORE YOU LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND YET YOU KNEW THAT EVIL THINGS MIGHT WELL BE HAPPENING IN THE SHIRE REMEMBER THAT THE MIRROR SHOWS MANY THINGS AND NOT ALL HAVE YET COME TO PASS SOME NEVER COME TO BE UNLESS THOSE THAT BEHOLD THE VISIONS TURN ASIDE FROM THEIR PATH TO PREVENT THEM THE MIRROR IS DANGEROUS AS A GUIDE OF DEEDS
SAM SAT ON THE GROUND AND PUT HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS I WISH I HAD NEVER COME HERE AND I DONT WANT TO SEE NO MORE MAGIC HE SAID AND FELL SILENT AFTER A MOMENT HE SPOKE AGAIN THICKLY AS IF STRUGGLING WITH TEARS NO ILL GO HOME BY THE LONG ROAD WITH MR FRODO OR NOT AT ALL HE SAID BUT I HOPE I DO GET BACK SOME DAY IF WHAT IVE SEEN TURNS OUT TRUE SOMEBODYS GOING TO CATCH IT HOT
DO YOU NOW WISH TO LOOK FRODO SAID THE LADY GALADRIEL YOU DID NOT WISH TO SEE ELFMAGIC AND WERE CONTENT
DO YOU ADVISE ME TO LOOK ASKED FRODO
NO SHE SAID I DO NOT COUNSEL YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I AM NOT A COUNSELLOR YOU MAY LEARN SOMETHING AND WHETHER WHAT YOU SEE BE FAIR OR EVIL THAT MAY BE PROFITABLE AND YET IT MAY NOT SEEING IS BOTH GOOD AND PERILOUS YET I THINK FRODO THAT YOU HAVE COURAGE AND WISDOM ENOUGH FOR THE VENTURE OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE DO AS YOU WILL

I WILL LOOK SAID FRODO AND HE CLIMBED ON THE PEDESTAL AND BENT OVER THE DARK WATER AT ONCE THE MIRROR CLEARED AND HE SAW A TWILIT LAND MOUNTAINS LOOMED DARK IN THE DISTANCE AGAINST A PALE SKY A LONG GREY ROAD WOUND BACK OUT OF SIGHT FAR AWAY A FIGURE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE ROAD FAINT AND SMALL AT FIRST BUT GROWING LARGER AND CLEARER AS IT APPROACHED SUDDENLY FRODO REALIZED THAT IT REMINDED HIM OF GANDALF HE ALMOST CALLED ALOUD THE WIZARDS NAME AND THEN HE SAW THAT THE FIGURE WAS CLOTHED NOT IN GREY BUT IN WHITE IN A WHITE THAT SHONE FAINTLY IN THE DUSK AND IN ITS HAND THERE WAS A WHITE STAFF THE HEAD WAS SO BOWED THAT HE COULD SEE NO FACE AND PRESENTLY THE FIGURE TURNED ASIDE ROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD AND WENT OUT OF THE MIRRORS VIEW DOUBT CAME INTO FRODOS MIND WAS THIS A VISION OF GANDALF ON ONE OF HIS MANY LONELY JOURNEYS LONG AGO OR WAS IT SARUMAN
THE VISION NOW CHANGED BRIEF AND SMALL BUT VERY VIVID HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF BILBO WALKING RESTLESSLY ABOUT HIS ROOM THE TABLE WAS LITTERED WITH DISORDERED PAPERS RAIN WAS BEATING ON THE WINDOWS
THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE AND AFTER IT MANY SWIFT SCENES FOLLOWED THAT FRODO IN SOME WAY KNEW TO BE PARTS OF A GREAT HISTORY IN WHICH HE HAD BECOME INVOLVED THE MIST CLEARED AND HE SAW A SIGHT WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE BUT KNEW AT ONCE THE SEA DARKNESS FELL THE SEA ROSE AND RAGED IN A GREAT STORM THEN HE SAW AGAINST THE SUN SINKING BLOODRED INTO A WRACK OF CLOUDS THE BLACK OUTLINE OF A TALL SHIP WITH TORN SAILS RIDING UP OUT OF THE WEST THEN A WIDE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH A POPULOUS CITY THEN A WHITE FORTRESS WITH SEVEN TOWERS AND THEN AGAIN A SHIP WITH BLACK SAILS BUT NOW IT WAS MORNING AGAIN AND THE WATER RIPPLED WITH LIGHT AND A BANNER BEARING THE EMBLEM OF A WHITE TREE SHONE IN THE SUN A SMOKE AS OF FIRE AND BATTLE AROSE AND AGAIN THE SUN WENT DOWN IN A BURNING RED THAT FADED INTO A GREY MIST AND INTO THE MIST A SMALL SHIP PASSED AWAY TWINKLING WITH LIGHTS IT VANISHED AND FRODO SIGHED AND PREPARED TO DRAW AWAY
BUT SUDDENLY THE MIRROR WENT ALTOGETHER DARK AS DARK AS IF A HOLE HAD OPENED IN THE WORLD OF SIGHT AND FRODO LOOKED INTO EMPTINESS IN THE BLACK ABYSS THERE APPEARED A SINGLE EYE THAT SLOWLY GREW UNTIL IT FILLED NEARLY ALL THE MIRROR SO TERRIBLE WAS IT THAT FRODO STOOD ROOTED UNABLE TO CRY OUT OR TO WITHDRAW HIS GAZE THE EYE WAS RIMMED WITH FIRE BUT WAS ITSELF GLAZED YELLOW AS A CATS WATCHFUL AND INTENT AND THE BLACK SLIT OF ITS PUPIL OPENED ON A PIT A WINDOW INTO NOTHING
THEN THE EYE BEGAN TO ROVE SEARCHING THIS WAY AND THAT AND FRODO KNEW WITH CERTAINTY AND HORROR THAT AMONG THE MANY THINGS THAT IT SOUGHT HE HIMSELF WAS ONE BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT IT COULD NOT SEE HIMNOT YET NOT UNLESS HE WILLED IT THE RING THAT HUNG UPON ITS CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK GREW HEAVY HEAVIER THAN A GREAT STONE AND HIS HEAD WAS DRAGGED DOWNWARDS THE MIRROR SEEMED TO BE GROWING HOT AND CURLS OF STEAM WERE RISING FROM THE WATER HE WAS SLIPPING FORWARD
DO NOT TOUCH THE WATER SAID THE LADY GALADRIEL SOFTLY THE VISION FADED AND FRODO FOUND THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE COOL STARS TWINKLING IN THE SILVER BASIN HE STEPPED BACK SHAKING ALL OVER AND LOOKED AT THE LADY
I KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT YOU LAST SAW SHE SAID FOR THAT IS ALSO IN MY MIND DO NOT BE AFRAID BUT DO NOT THINK THAT ONLY BY SINGING AMID THE TREES NOR EVEN BY THE SLENDER ARROWS OF ELVENBOWS IS THIS LAND OF LOTHLORIEN MAINTAINED AND DEFENDED AGAINST ITS ENEMY I SAY TO YOU FRODO THAT EVEN AS I SPEAK TO YOU I PERCEIVE THE DARK LORD AND KNOW HIS MIND OR ALL OF HIS MIND THAT CONCERNS THE ELVES AND HE GROPES EVER TO SEE ME AND MY THOUGHT BUT STILL THE DOOR IS CLOSED
SHE LIFTED UP HER WHITE ARMS AND SPREAD OUT HER HANDS TOWARDS THE EAST IN A GESTURE OF REJECTION AND DENIAL EARENDIL THE EVENING STAR MOST BELOVED OF THE ELVES SHONE CLEAR ABOVE SO BRIGHT WAS IT THAT THE FIGURE OF THE ELVENLADY CAST A DIM SHADOW ON THE GROUND ITS RAYS GLANCED UPON A RING ABOUT HER FINGER IT GLITTERED LIKE POLISHED GOLD OVERLAID WITH SILVER LIGHT AND A WHITE STONE IN IT TWINKLED AS IF THE EVENSTAR HAD COME DOWN TO REST UPON HER HAND FRODO GAZED AT THE RING WITH AWE FOR SUDDENLY IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE UNDERSTOOD
YES SHE SAID DIVINING HIS THOUGHT IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO SPEAK OF IT AND ELROND COULD NOT DO SO BUT IT CANNOT BE HIDDEN FROM THE RINGBEARER AND ONE WHO HAS SEEN THE EYE VERILY IT IS IN THE LAND OF LORIEN UPON THE FINGER OF GALADRIEL THAT ONE OF THE THREE REMAINS THIS IS NENYA THE RING OF ADAMANT AND I AM ITS KEEPER
HE SUSPECTS BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW  NOT YET DO YOU NOT SEE NOW WHEREFORE YOUR COMING IS TO US AS THE FOOTSTEP OF DOOM FOR IF YOU FAIL THEN WE ARE LAID BARE TO THE ENEMY YET IF YOU SUCCEED THEN OUR POWER IS DIMINISHED AND LOTHLORIEN WILL FADE AND THE TIDES OF TIME WILL SWEEP IT AWAY WE MUST DEPART INTO THE WEST OR DWINDLE TO A RUSTIC FOLK OF DELL AND CAVE SLOWLY TO FORGET AND TO BE FORGOTTEN
FRODO BENT HIS HEAD AND WHAT DO YOU WISH HE SAID AT LAST
THAT WHAT SHOULD BE SHALL BE SHE ANSWERED THE LOVE OF THE ELVES FOR THEIR LAND AND THEIR WORKS IS DEEPER THAN THE DEEPS OF THE SEA AND THEIR REGRET IS UNDYING AND CANNOT EVER WHOLLY BE ASSUAGED YET THEY WILL CAST ALL AWAY RATHER THAN SUBMIT TO SAURON FOR THEY KNOW HIM NOW FOR THE FATE OF LOTHLORIEN YOU ARE NOT ANSWERABLE BUT ONLY FOR THE DOING OF YOUR OWN TASK YET I COULD WISH WERE IT OF ANY AVAIL THAT THE ONE RING HAD NEVER BEEN WROUGHT OR HAD REMAINED FOR EVER LOST
YOU ARE WISE AND FEARLESS AND FAIR LADY GALADRIEL SAID FRODO I WILL GIVE YOU THE ONE RING IF YOU ASK FOR IT IT IS TOO GREAT A MATTER FOR ME
GALADRIEL LAUGHED WITH A SUDDEN CLEAR LAUGH WISE THE LADY GALADRIEL MAY BE SHE SAID YET HERE SHE HAS MET HER MATCH IN COURTESY GENTLY ARE YOU REVENGED FOR MY TESTING OF YOUR HEART AT OUR FIRST MEETING YOU BEGIN TO SEE WITH A KEEN EYE I DO NOT DENY THAT MY HEART HAS GREATLY DESIRED TO ASK WHAT YOU OFFER FOR MANY LONG YEARS I HAD PONDERED WHAT I MIGHT DO SHOULD THE GREAT RING COME INTO MY HANDS AND BEHOLD IT WAS BROUGHT WITHIN MY GRASP THE EVIL THAT WAS DEVISED LONG AGO WORKS ON IN MANY WAYS WHETHER SAURON HIMSELF STANDS OR FALLS WOULD NOT THAT HAVE BEEN A NOBLE DEED TO SET TO THE CREDIT OF HIS RING IF I HAD TAKEN IT BY FORCE OR FEAR FROM MY GUEST

SHE LIFTED UP HER HAND AND FROM THE RING THAT SHE WORE THERE ISSUED A GREAT LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATED HER ALONE AND LEFT ALL ELSE DARK SHE STOOD BEFORE FRODO SEEMING NOW TALL BEYOND MEASUREMENT AND BEAUTIFUL BEYOND ENDURING TERRIBLE AND WORSHIPFUL THEN SHE LET HER HAND FALL AND THE LIGHT FADED AND SUDDENLY SHE LAUGHED AGAIN AND LO SHE WAS SHRUNKEN A SLENDER ELFWOMAN CLAD IN SIMPLE WHITE WHOSE GENTLE VOICE WAS SOFT AND SAD

CHAPTER 8
FAREWELL TO LORIEN

THAT NIGHT THE COMPANY WAS AGAIN SUMMONED TO THE CHAMBER OF CELEBORN AND THERE THE LORD AND LADY GREETED THEM WITH FAIR WORDS AT LENGTH CELEBORN SPOKE OF THEIR DEPARTURE
NOW IS THE TIME HE SAID WHEN THOSE WHO WISH TO CONTINUE THE QUEST MUST HARDEN THEIR HEARTS TO LEAVE THIS LAND THOSE WHO NO LONGER WISH TO GO FORWARD MAY REMAIN HERE FOR A WHILE BUT WHETHER THEY STAY OR GO NONE CAN BE SURE OF PEACE FOR WE ARE COME NOW TO THE EDGE OF DOOM HERE THOSE WHO WISH MAY AWAIT THE ONCOMING OF THE HOUR TILL EITHER THE WAYS OF THE WORLD LIE OPEN AGAIN OR WE SUMMON THEM TO THE LAST NEED OF LORIEN THEN THEY MAY RETURN TO THEIR OWN LANDS OR ELSE GO TO THE LONG HOME OF THOSE THAT FALL IN BATTLE
THERE WAS A SILENCE THEY ALL RESOLVED TO GO FORWARD SAID GALADRIEL LOOKING IN THEIR EYES
AS FOR ME SAID BOROMIR MY WAY HOME LIES ONWARD AND NOT BACK
THAT IS TRUE SAID CELEBORN BUT IS ALL THIS COMPANY GOING WITH YOU TO MINAS TIRITH
WE HAVE NOT DECIDED OUR COURSE SAID ARAGORN BEYOND LOTHLORIEN I DO NOT KNOW WHAT GANDALF INTENDED TO DO INDEED I DO NOT THINK THAT EVEN HE HAD ANY CLEAR PURPOSE
MAYBE NOT SAID CELEBORN YET WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS LAND YOU CAN NO LONGER FORGET THE GREAT RIVER AS SOME OF YOU KNOW WELL IT CANNOT BE CROSSED BY TRAVELLERS WITH BAGGAGE BETWEEN LORIEN AND GONDOR SAVE BY BOAT AND ARE NOT THE BRIDGES OF OSGILIATH BROKEN DOWN AND ALL THE LANDINGS HELD NOW BY THE ENEMY
ON WHICH SIDE WILL YOU JOURNEY THE WAY TO MINAS TIRITH LIES UPON THIS SIDE UPON THE WEST BUT THE STRAIGHT ROAD OF THE QUEST LIES EAST OF THE RIVER UPON THE DARKER SHORE WHICH SHORE WILL YOU NOW TAKE
IF MY ADVICE IS HEEDED IT WILL BE THE WESTERN SHORE AND THE WAY TO MINAS TIRITH ANSWERED BOROMIR BUT I AM NOT THE LEADER OF THE COMPANY THE OTHERS SAID NOTHING AND ARAGORN LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND TROUBLED
I SEE THAT YOU DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT TO DO SAID CELEBORN IT IS NOT MY PART TO CHOOSE FOR YOU BUT I WILL HELP YOU AS I MAY THERE ARE SOME AMONG YOU WHO CAN HANDLE BOATS LEGOLAS WHOSE FOLK KNOW THE SWIFT FOREST RIVER AND BOROMIR OF GONDOR AND ARAGORN THE TRAVELLER
AND ONE HOBBIT CRIED MERRY NOT ALL OF US LOOK ON BOATS AS WILD HORSES MY PEOPLE LIVE BY THE BANKS OF THE BRANDYWINE
THAT IS WELL SAID CELEBORN THEN I WILL FURNISH YOUR COMPANY WITH BOATS THEY MUST BE SMALL AND LIGHT FOR IF YOU GO FAR BY WATER THERE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU WILL BE FORCED TO CARRY THEM YOU WILL COME TO THE RAPIDS OF SARN GEBIR AND MAYBE AT LAST TO THE GREAT FALLS OF RAUROS WHERE THE RIVER THUNDERS DOWN FROM NEN HITHOEL AND THERE ARE OTHER PERILS BOATS MAY MAKE YOUR JOURNEY LESS TOILSOME FOR A WHILE YET THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU COUNSEL IN THE END YOU MUST LEAVE THEM AND THE RIVER AND TURN WEST  OR EAST
ARAGORN THANKED CELEBORN MANY TIMES THE GIFT OF BOATS COMFORTED HIM MUCH NOT LEAST BECAUSE THERE WOULD NOW BE NO NEED TO DECIDE HIS COURSE FOR SOME DAYS THE OTHERS TOO LOOKED MORE HOPEFUL WHATEVER PERILS LAY AHEAD IT SEEMED BETTER TO FLOAT DOWN THE BROAD TIDE OF ANDUIN TO MEET THEM THAN TO PLOD FORWARD WITH BENT BACKS ONLY SAM WAS DOUBTFUL HE AT ANY RATE STILL THOUGHT BOATS AS BAD AS WILD HORSES OR WORSE AND NOT ALL THE DANGERS THAT HE HAD SURVIVED MADE HIM THINK BETTER OF THEM
ALL SHALL BE PREPARED FOR YOU AND AWAIT YOU AT THE HAVEN BEFORE NOON TOMORROW SAID CELEBORN I WILL SEND MY PEOPLE TO YOU IN THE MORNING TO HELP YOU MAKE READY FOR THE JOURNEY NOW WE WILL WISH YOU ALL A FAIR NIGHT AND UNTROUBLED SLEEP
GOOD NIGHT MY FRIENDS SAID GALADRIEL SLEEP IN PEACE DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR HEARTS OVERMUCH WITH THOUGHT OF THE ROAD TONIGHT MAYBE THE PATHS THAT YOU EACH SHALL TREAD ARE ALREADY LAID BEFORE YOUR FEET THOUGH YOU DO NOT SEE THEM GOOD NIGHT
THE COMPANY NOW TOOK THEIR LEAVE AND RETURNED TO THEIR PAVILION LEGOLAS WENT WITH THEM FOR THIS WAS TO BE THEIR LAST NIGHT IN LOTHLORIEN AND IN SPITE OF THE WORDS OF GALADRIEL THEY WISHED TO TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER
FOR A LONG TIME THEY DEBATED WHAT THEY SHOULD DO AND HOW IT WOULD BE BEST TO ATTEMPT THE FULFILLING OF THEIR PURPOSE WITH THE RING BUT THEY CAME TO NO DECISION IT WAS PLAIN THAT MOST OF THEM DESIRED TO GO FIRST TO MINAS TIRITH AND TO ESCAPE AT LEAST FOR A WHILE FROM THE TERROR OF THE ENEMY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO FOLLOW A LEADER OVER THE RIVER AND INTO THE SHADOW OF MORDOR BUT FRODO SPOKE NO WORD AND ARAGORN WAS STILL DIVIDED IN HIS MIND
HIS OWN PLAN WHILE GANDALF REMAINED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO GO WITH BOROMIR AND WITH HIS SWORD HELP TO DELIVER GONDOR FOR HE BELIEVED THAT THE MESSAGE OF THE DREAMS WAS A SUMMONS AND THAT THE HOUR HAD COME AT LAST WHEN THE HEIR OF ELENDIL SHOULD COME FORTH AND STRIVE WITH SAURON FOR THE MASTERY BUT IN MORIA THE BURDEN OF GANDALF HAD BEEN LAID ON HIM AND HE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT NOW FORSAKE THE RING IF FRODO REFUSED IN THE END TO GO WITH BOROMIR AND YET WHAT HELP COULD HE OR ANY OF THE COMPANY GIVE TO FRODO SAVE TO WALK BLINDLY WITH HIM INTO THE DARKNESS
I SHALL GO TO MINAS TIRITH ALONE IF NEED BE FOR IT IS MY DUTY SAID BOROMIR AND AFTER THAT HE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE SITTING WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON FRODO AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO READ THE HALFLINGS THOUGHTS AT LENGTH HE SPOKE AGAIN SOFTLY AS IF HE WAS DEBATING WITH HIMSELF IF YOU WISH ONLY TO DESTROY THE RING HE SAID THEN THERE IS LITTLE USE IN WAR AND WEAPONS AND THE MEN OF MINAS TIRITH CANNOT HELP BUT IF YOU WISH TO DESTROY THE ARMED MIGHT OF THE DARK LORD THEN IT IS FOLLY TO GO WITHOUT FORCE INTO HIS DOMAIN AND FOLLY TO THROW AWAY HE PAUSED SUDDENLY AS IF HE HAD BECOME AWARE THAT HE WAS SPEAKING HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO THROW LIVES AWAY I MEAN HE ENDED IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN DEFENDING A STRONG PLACE AND WALKING OPENLY INTO THE ARMS OF DEATH AT LEAST THAT IS HOW I SEE IT
FRODO CAUGHT SOMETHING NEW AND STRANGE IN BOROMIRS GLANCE AND HE LOOKED HARD AT HIM PLAINLY BOROMIRS THOUGHT WAS DIFFERENT FROM HIS FINAL WORDS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO THROW AWAY WHAT THE RING OF POWER HE HAD SAID SOMETHING LIKE THIS AT THE COUNCIL BUT THEN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE CORRECTION OF ELROND FRODO LOOKED AT ARAGORN BUT HE SEEMED DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHT AND MADE NO SIGN THAT HE HAD HEEDED BOROMIRS WORDS AND SO THEIR DEBATE ENDED MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE ALREADY ASLEEP AND SAM WAS NODDING THE NIGHT WAS GROWING OLD
IN THE MORNING AS THEY WERE BEGINNING TO PACK THEIR SLENDER GOODS ELVES THAT COULD SPEAK THEIR TONGUE CAME TO THEM AND BROUGHT THEM MANY GIFTS OF FOOD AND CLOTHING FOR THE JOURNEY THE FOOD WAS MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF VERY THIN CAKES MADE OF A MEAL THAT WAS BAKED A LIGHT BROWN ON THE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE WAS THE COLOUR OF CREAM GIMLI TOOK UP ONE OF THE CAKES AND LOOKED AT IT WITH A DOUBTFUL EYE
CRAM HE SAID UNDER HIS BREATH AS HE BROKE OFF A CRISP CORNER AND NIBBLED AT IT HIS EXPRESSION QUICKLY CHANGED AND HE ATE ALL THE REST OF THE CAKE WITH RELISH
NO MORE NO MORE CRIED THE ELVES LAUGHING YOU HAVE EATEN ENOUGH ALREADY FOR A LONG DAYS MARCH
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A KIND OF CRAM SUCH AS THE DALEMEN MAKE FOR JOURNEYS IN THE WILD SAID THE DWARF
SO IT IS THEY ANSWERED BUT WE CALL IT LEMBAS OR WAYBREAD AND IT IS MORE STRENGTHENING THAN ANY FOOD MADE BY MEN AND IT IS MORE PLEASANT THAN CRAM BY ALL ACCOUNTS
INDEED IT IS SAID GIMLI WHY IT IS BETTER THAN THE HONEYCAKES OF THE BEORNINGS AND THAT IS GREAT PRAISE FOR THE BEORNINGS ARE THE BEST BAKERS THAT I KNOW OF BUT THEY ARE NONE TOO WILLING TO DEAL OUT THEIR CAKES TO TRAVELLERS IN THESE DAYS YOU ARE KINDLY HOSTS
ALL THE SAME WE BID YOU SPARE THE FOOD THEY SAID EAT LITTLE AT A TIME AND ONLY AT NEED FOR THESE THINGS ARE GIVEN TO SERVE YOU WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS THE CAKES WILL KEEP SWEET FOR MANY MANY DAYS IF THEY ARE UNBROKEN AND LEFT IN THEIR LEAFWRAPPINGS AS WE HAVE BROUGHT THEM ONE WILL KEEP A TRAVELLER ON HIS FEET FOR A DAY OF LONG LABOUR EVEN IF HE BE ONE OF THE TALL MEN OF MINAS TIRITH
THE ELVES NEXT UNWRAPPED AND GAVE TO EACH OF THE COMPANY THE CLOTHES THEY HAD BROUGHT FOR EACH THEY HAD PROVIDED A HOOD AND CLOAK MADE ACCORDING TO HIS SIZE OF THE LIGHT BUT WARM SILKEN STUFF THAT THE GALADHRIM WOVE IT WAS HARD TO SAY OF WHAT COLOUR THEY WERE GREY WITH THE HUE OF TWILIGHT UNDER THE TREES THEY SEEMED TO BE AND YET IF THEY WERE MOVED OR SET IN ANOTHER LIGHT THEY WERE GREEN AS SHADOWED LEAVES OR BROWN AS FALLOW FIELDS BY NIGHT DUSKSILVER AS WATER UNDER THE STARS EACH CLOAK WAS FASTENED ABOUT THE NECK WITH A BROOCH LIKE A GREEN LEAF VEINED WITH SILVER
ARE THESE MAGIC CLOAKS ASKED PIPPIN LOOKING AT THEM WITH WONDER
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT ANSWERED THE LEADER OF THE ELVES THEY ARE FAIR GARMENTS AND THE WEB IS GOOD FOR IT WAS MADE IN THIS LAND THEY ARE ELVISH ROBES CERTAINLY IF THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN LEAF AND BRANCH WATER AND STONE THEY HAVE THE HUE AND BEAUTY OF ALL THESE THINGS UNDER THE TWILIGHT OF LORIEN THAT WE LOVE FOR WE PUT THE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT WE LOVE INTO ALL THAT WE MAKE YET THEY ARE GARMENTS NOT ARMOUR AND THEY WILL NOT TURN SHAFT OR BLADE BUT THEY SHOULD SERVE YOU WELL THEY ARE LIGHT TO WEAR AND WARM ENOUGH OR COOL ENOUGH AT NEED AND YOU WILL FIND THEM A GREAT AID IN KEEPING OUT OF THE SIGHT OF UNFRIENDLY EYES WHETHER YOU WALK AMONG THE STONES OR THE TREES YOU ARE INDEED HIGH IN THE FAVOUR OF THE LADY FOR SHE HERSELF AND HER MAIDENS WOVE THIS STUFF AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE CLAD STRANGERS IN THE GARB OF OUR OWN PEOPLE
AFTER THEIR MORNING MEAL THE COMPANY SAID FAREWELL TO THE LAWN BY THE FOUNTAIN THEIR HEARTS WERE HEAVY FOR IT WAS A FAIR PLACE AND IT HAD BECOME LIKE HOME TO THEM THOUGH THEY COULD NOT COUNT THE DAYS AND NIGHTS THAT THEY HAD PASSED THERE AS THEY STOOD FOR A MOMENT LOOKING AT THE WHITE WATER IN THE SUNLIGHT HALDIR CAME WALKING TOWARDS THEM OVER THE GREEN GRASS OF THE GLADE FRODO GREETED HIM WITH DELIGHT
I HAVE RETURNED FROM THE NORTHERN FENCES SAID THE ELF AND I AM SENT NOW TO BE YOUR GUIDE AGAIN THE DIMRILL DALE IS FULL OF VAPOUR AND CLOUDS OF SMOKE AND THE MOUNTAINS ARE TROUBLED THERE ARE NOISES IN THE DEEPS OF THE EARTH IF ANY OF YOU HAD THOUGHT OF RETURNING NORTHWARDS TO YOUR HOMES YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS THAT WAY BUT COME YOUR PATH NOW GOES SOUTH
AS THEY WALKED THROUGH CARAS GALADHON THE GREEN WAYS WERE EMPTY BUT IN THE TREES ABOVE THEM MANY VOICES WERE MURMURING AND SINGING THEY THEMSELVES WENT SILENTLY AT LAST HALDIR LED THEM DOWN THE SOUTHWARD SLOPES OF THE HILL AND THEY CAME AGAIN TO THE GREAT GATE HUNG WITH LAMPS AND TO THE WHITE BRIDGE AND SO THEY PASSED OUT AND LEFT THE CITY OF THE ELVES THEN THEY TURNED AWAY FROM THE PAVED ROAD AND TOOK A PATH THAT WENT OFF INTO A DEEP THICKET OF MALLORNTREES AND PASSED ON WINDING THROUGH ROLLING WOODLANDS OF SILVER SHADOW LEADING THEM EVER DOWN SOUTHWARDS AND EASTWARDS TOWARDS THE SHORES OF THE RIVER
THEY HAD GONE SOME TEN MILES AND NOON WAS AT HAND WHEN THEY CAME ON A HIGH GREEN WALL PASSING THROUGH AN OPENING THEY CAME SUDDENLY OUT OF THE TREES BEFORE THEM LAY A LONG LAWN OF SHINING GRASS STUDDED WITH GOLDEN ELANOR THAT GLINTED IN THE SUN THE LAWN RAN OUT INTO A NARROW TONGUE BETWEEN BRIGHT MARGINS ON THE RIGHT AND WEST THE SILVERLODE FLOWED GLITTERING ON THE LEFT AND EAST THE GREAT RIVER ROLLED ITS BROAD WATERS DEEP AND DARK ON THE FURTHER SHORES THE WOODLANDS STILL MARCHED ON SOUTHWARDS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE BUT ALL THE BANKS WERE BLEAK AND BARE NO MALLORN LIFTED ITS GOLDHUNG BOUGHS BEYOND THE LAND OF LORIEN
ON THE BANK OF THE SILVERLODE AT SOME DISTANCE UP FROM THE MEETING OF THE STREAMS THERE WAS A HYTHE OF WHITE STONES AND WHITE WOOD BY IT WERE MOORED MANY BOATS AND BARGES SOME WERE BRIGHTLY PAINTED AND SHONE WITH SILVER AND GOLD AND GREEN BUT MOST WERE EITHER WHITE OR GREY THREE SMALL GREY BOATS HAD BEEN MADE READY FOR THE TRAVELLERS AND IN THESE THE ELVES STOWED THEIR GOODS AND THEY ADDED ALSO COILS OF ROPE THREE TO EACH BOAT SLENDER THEY LOOKED BUT STRONG SILKEN TO THE TOUCH GREY OF HUE LIKE THE ELVENCLOAKS
WHAT ARE THESE ASKED SAM HANDLING ONE THAT LAY UPON THE GREENSWARD
ROPES INDEED ANSWERED AN ELF FROM THE BOATS NEVER TRAVEL FAR WITHOUT A ROPE AND ONE THAT IS LONG AND STRONG AND LIGHT SUCH ARE THESE THEY MAY BE A HELP IN MANY NEEDS
YOU DONT NEED TO TELL ME THAT SAID SAM I CAME WITHOUT ANY AND IVE BEEN WORRIED EVER SINCE BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT THESE WERE MADE OF KNOWING A BIT ABOUT ROPEMAKING ITS IN THE FAMILY AS YOU MIGHT SAY
THEY ARE MADE OF HITHLAIN SAID THE ELF BUT THERE IS NO TIME NOW TO INSTRUCT YOU IN THE ART OF THEIR MAKING HAD WE KNOWN THAT THIS CRAFT DELIGHTED YOU WE COULD HAVE TAUGHT YOU MUCH BUT NOW ALAS UNLESS YOU SHOULD AT SOME TIME RETURN HITHER YOU MUST BE CONTENT WITH OUR GIFT MAY IT SERVE YOU WELL
COME SAID HALDIR ALL IS NOW READY FOR YOU ENTER THE BOATS BUT TAKE CARE AT FIRST
HEED THE WORDS SAID THE OTHER ELVES THESE BOATS ARE LIGHTBUILT AND THEY ARE CRAFTY AND UNLIKE THE BOATS OF OTHER FOLK THEY WILL NOT SINK LADE THEM AS YOU WILL BUT THEY ARE WAYWARD IF MISHANDLED IT WOULD BE WISE IF YOU ACCUSTOMED YOURSELVES TO STEPPING IN AND OUT HERE WHERE THERE IS A LANDINGPLACE BEFORE YOU SET OFF DOWNSTREAM
THE COMPANY WAS ARRANGED IN THIS WAY ARAGORN FRODO AND SAM WERE IN ONE BOAT BOROMIR MERRY AND PIPPIN IN ANOTHER AND IN THE THIRD WERE LEGOLAS AND GIMLI WHO HAD NOW BECOME FAST FRIENDS IN THIS LAST BOAT MOST OF THE GOODS AND PACKS WERE STOWED THE BOATS WERE MOVED AND STEERED WITH SHORTHANDLED PADDLES THAT HAD BROAD LEAFSHAPED BLADES WHEN ALL WAS READY ARAGORN LED THEM ON A TRIAL UP THE SILVERLODE THE CURRENT WAS SWIFT AND THEY WENT FORWARD SLOWLY SAM SAT IN THE BOWS CLUTCHING THE SIDES AND LOOKING BACK WISTFULLY TO THE SHORE THE SUNLIGHT GLITTERING ON THE WATER DAZZLED HIS EYES AS THEY PASSED BEYOND THE GREEN FIELD OF THE TONGUE THE TREES DREW DOWN TO THE RIVERS BRINK HERE AND THERE GOLDEN LEAVES TOSSED AND FLOATED ON THE RIPPLING STREAM THE AIR WAS VERY BRIGHT AND STILL AND THERE WAS A SILENCE EXCEPT FOR THE HIGH DISTANT SONG OF LARKS
THEY TURNED A SHARP BEND IN THE RIVER AND THERE SAILING PROUDLY DOWN THE STREAM TOWARD THEM THEY SAW A SWAN OF GREAT SIZE THE WATER RIPPLED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WHITE BREAST BENEATH ITS CURVING NECK ITS BEAK SHONE LIKE BURNISHED GOLD AND ITS EYES GLINTED LIKE JET SET IN YELLOW STONES ITS HUGE WHITE WINGS WERE HALF LIFTED A MUSIC CAME DOWN THE RIVER AS IT DREW NEARER AND SUDDENLY THEY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS A SHIP WROUGHT AND CARVED WITH ELVENSKILL IN THE LIKENESS OF A BIRD TWO ELVES CLAD IN WHITE STEERED IT WITH BLACK PADDLES IN THE MIDST OF THE VESSEL SAT CELEBORN AND BEHIND HIM STOOD GALADRIEL TALL AND WHITE A CIRCLET OF GOLDEN FLOWERS WAS IN HER HAIR AND IN HER HAND SHE HELD A HARP AND SHE SANG SAD AND SWEET WAS THE SOUND OF HER VOICE IN THE COOL CLEAR AIR
I SANG OF LEAVES OF LEAVES OF GOLD AND LEAVES OF GOLD THERE GREW
OF WIND I SANG A WIND THERE CAME AND IN THE BRANCHES BLEW
BEYOND THE SUN BEYOND THE MOON THE FOAM WAS ON THE SEA
AND BY THE STRAND OF ILMARIN THERE GREW A GOLDEN TREE
BENEATH THE STARS OF EVEREVE IN ELDAMAR IT SHONE
IN ELDAMAR BESIDE THE WALLS OF ELVEN TIRION
THERE LONG THE GOLDEN LEAVES HAVE GROWN UPON THE BRANCHING YEARS
WHILE HERE BEYOND THE SUNDERING SEAS NOW FALL THE ELVENTEARS
O LORIEN THE WINTER COMES THE BARE AND LEAFLESS DAY
THE LEAVES ARE FALLING IN THE STREAM THE RIVER FLOWS AWAY
O LORIEN TOO LONG I HAVE DWELT UPON THIS HITHER SHORE
AND IN A FADING CROWN HAVE TWINED THE GOLDEN ELANOR
BUT IF OF SHIPS I NOW SHOULD SING WHAT SHIP WOULD COME TO ME
WHAT SHIP WOULD BEAR ME EVER BACK ACROSS SO WIDE A SEA

ARAGORN STAYED HIS BOAT AS THE SWANSHIP DREW ALONGSIDE THE LADY ENDED HER SONG AND GREETED THEM WE HAVE COME TO BID YOU OUR LAST FAREWELL SHE SAID AND TO SPEED YOU WITH BLESSINGS FROM OUR LAND
THOUGH YOU HAVE BEEN OUR GUESTS SAID CELEBORN YOU HAVE NOT YET EATEN WITH US AND WE BID YOU THEREFORE TO A PARTING FEAST HERE BETWEEN THE FLOWING WATERS THAT WILL BEAR YOU FAR FROM LORIEN
THE SWAN PASSED ON SLOWLY TO THE HYTHE AND THEY TURNED THEIR BOATS AND FOLLOWED IT THERE IN THE LAST END OF EGLADIL UPON THE GREEN GRASS THE PARTING FEAST WAS HELD BUT FRODO ATE AND DRANK LITTLE HEEDING ONLY THE BEAUTY OF THE LADY AND HER VOICE SHE SEEMED NO LONGER PERILOUS OR TERRIBLE NOR FILLED WITH HIDDEN POWER ALREADY SHE SEEMED TO HIM AS BY MEN OF LATER DAYS ELVES STILL AT TIMES ARE SEEN PRESENT AND YET REMOTE A LIVING VISION OF THAT WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN LEFT FAR BEHIND BY THE FLOWING STREAMS OF TIME
AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRUNK SITTING UPON THE GRASS CELEBORN SPOKE TO THEM AGAIN OF THEIR JOURNEY AND LIFTING HIS HAND HE POINTED SOUTH TO THE WOODS BEYOND THE TONGUE
AS YOU GO DOWN THE WATER HE SAID YOU WILL FIND THAT THE TREES WILL FAIL AND YOU WILL COME TO A BARREN COUNTRY THERE THE RIVER FLOWS IN STONY VALE AMID HIGH MOORS UNTIL AT LAST AFTER MANY LEAGUES IT COMES TO THE TALL ISLAND OF THE TINDROCK THAT WE CALL TOL BRANDIR THERE IT CASTS ITS ARMS ABOUT THE STEEP SHORES OF THE ISLE AND FALLS THEN WITH A GREAT NOISE AND SMOKE OVER THE CATARACTS OF RAUROS DOWN INTO THE NINDALF THE WETWANG AS IT IS CALLED IN YOUR TONGUE THAT IS A WIDE REGION OF SLUGGISH FEN WHERE THE STREAM BECOMES TORTUOUS AND MUCH DIVIDED THERE THE ENTWASH FLOWS IN BY MANY MOUTHS FROM THE FOREST OF FANGORN IN THE WEST ABOUT THAT STREAM ON THIS SIDE OF THE GREAT RIVER LIES ROHAN ON THE FURTHER SIDE ARE THE BLEAK HILLS OF THE EMYN MUIL THE WIND BLOWS FROM THE EAST THERE FOR THEY LOOK OUT OVER THE DEAD MARSHES AND THE NOMANLANDS TO CIRITH GORGOR AND THE BLACK GATES OF MORDOR
BOROMIR AND ANY THAT GO WITH HIM SEEKING MINAS TIRITH WILL DO WELL TO LEAVE THE GREAT RIVER ABOVE RAUROS AND CROSS THE ENTWASH BEFORE IT FINDS THE MARSHES YET THEY SHOULD NOT GO TOO FAR UP THAT STREAM NOR RISK BECOMING ENTANGLED IN THE FOREST OF FANGORN THAT IS A STRANGE LAND AND IS NOW LITTLE KNOWN BUT BOROMIR AND ARAGORN DOUBTLESS DO NOT NEED THIS WARNING
INDEED WE HAVE HEARD OF FANGORN IN MINAS TIRITH SAID BOROMIR BUT WHAT I HAVE HEARD SEEMS TO ME FOR THE MOST PART OLD WIVES TALES SUCH AS WE TELL TO OUR CHILDREN ALL THAT LIES NORTH OF ROHAN IS NOW TO US SO FAR AWAY THAT FANCY CAN WANDER FREELY THERE OF OLD FANGORN LAY UPON THE BORDERS OF OUR REALM BUT IT IS NOW MANY LIVES OF MEN SINCE ANY OF US VISITED IT TO PROVE OR DISPROVE THE LEGENDS THAT HAVE COME DOWN FROM DISTANT YEARS
I HAVE MYSELF BEEN AT WHILES IN ROHAN BUT I HAVE NEVER CROSSED IT NORTHWARDS WHEN I WAS SENT OUT AS A MESSENGER I PASSED THROUGH THE GAP BY THE SKIRTS OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND CROSSED THE ISEN AND THE GREYFLOOD INTO NORTHERLAND A LONG AND WEARISOME JOURNEY FOUR HUNDRED LEAGUES I RECKONED IT AND IT TOOK ME MANY MONTHS FOR I LOST MY HORSE AT THARBAD AT THE FORDING OF THE GREYFLOOD AFTER THAT JOURNEY AND THE ROAD I HAVE TRODDEN WITH THIS COMPANY I DO NOT MUCH DOUBT THAT I SHALL FIND A WAY THROUGH ROHAN AND FANGORN TOO IF NEED BE
THEN I NEED SAY NO MORE SAID CELEBORN BUT DO NOT DESPISE THE LORE THAT HAS COME DOWN FROM DISTANT YEARS FOR OFT IT MAY CHANCE THAT OLD WIVES KEEP IN MEMORY WORD OF THINGS THAT ONCE WERE NEEDFUL FOR THE WISE TO KNOW
NOW GALADRIEL ROSE FROM THE GRASS AND TAKING A CUP FROM ONE OF HER MAIDENS SHE FILLED IT WITH WHITE MEAD AND GAVE IT TO CELEBORN
NOW IT IS TIME TO DRINK THE CUP OF FAREWELL SHE SAID DRINK LORD OF THE GALADHRIM AND LET NOT YOUR HEART BE SAD THOUGH NIGHT MUST FOLLOW NOON AND ALREADY OUR EVENING DRAWETH NIGH
THEN SHE BROUGHT THE CUP TO EACH OF THE COMPANY AND BADE THEM DRINK AND FAREWELL BUT WHEN THEY HAD DRUNK SHE COMMANDED THEM TO SIT AGAIN ON THE GRASS AND CHAIRS WERE SET FOR HER AND FOR CELEBORN HER MAIDENS STOOD SILENT ABOUT HER AND A WHILE SHE LOOKED UPON HER GUESTS AT LAST SHE SPOKE AGAIN
WE HAVE DRUNK THE CUP OF PARTING SHE SAID AND THE SHADOWS FALL BETWEEN US BUT BEFORE YOU GO I HAVE BROUGHT IN MY SHIP GIFTS WHICH THE LORD AND LADY OF THE GALADHRIM NOW OFFER YOU IN MEMORY OF LOTHLORIEN THEN SHE CALLED TO EACH IN TURN
HERE IS THE GIFT OF CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL TO THE LEADER OF YOUR COMPANY SHE SAID TO ARAGORN AND SHE GAVE HIM A SHEATH THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO FIT HIS SWORD IT WAS OVERLAID WITH A TRACERY OF FLOWERS AND LEAVES WROUGHT OF SILVER AND GOLD AND ON IT WERE SET IN ELVEN RUNES FORMED OF MANY GEMS THE NAME ANDURIL AND THE LINEAGE OF THE SWORD
THE BLADE THAT IS DRAWN FROM THIS SHEATH SHALL NOT BE STAINED OR BROKEN EVEN IN DEFEAT SHE SAID BUT IS THERE AUGHT ELSE THAT YOU DESIRE OF ME AT OUR PARTING FOR DARKNESS WILL FLOW BETWEEN US AND IT MAY BE THAT WE SHALL NOT MEET AGAIN UNLESS IT BE FAR HENCE UPON A ROAD THAT HAS NO RETURNING
AND ARAGORN ANSWERED LADY YOU KNOW ALL MY DESIRE AND LONG HELD IN KEEPING THE ONLY TREASURE THAT I SEEK YET IT IS NOT YOURS TO GIVE ME EVEN IF YOU WOULD AND ONLY THROUGH DARKNESS SHALL I COME TO IT
YET MAYBE THIS WILL LIGHTEN YOUR HEART SAID GALADRIEL FOR IT WAS LEFT IN MY CARE TO BE GIVEN TO YOU SHOULD YOU PASS THROUGH THIS LAND THEN SHE LIFTED FROM HER LAP A GREAT STONE OF A CLEAR GREEN SET IN A SILVER BROOCH THAT WAS WROUGHT IN THE LIKENESS OF AN EAGLE WITH OUTSPREAD WINGS AND AS SHE HELD IT UP THE GEM FLASHED LIKE THE SUN SHINING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF SPRING THIS STONE I GAVE TO CELEBRIAN MY DAUGHTER AND SHE TO HERS AND NOW IT COMES TO YOU AS A TOKEN OF HOPE IN THIS HOUR TAKE THE NAME THAT WAS FORETOLD FOR YOU ELESSAR THE ELFSTONE OF THE HOUSE OF ELENDIL
THEN ARAGORN TOOK THE STONE AND PINNED THE BROOCH UPON HIS BREAST AND THOSE WHO SAW HIM WONDERED FOR THEY HAD NOT MARKED BEFORE HOW TALL AND KINGLY HE STOOD AND IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT MANY YEARS OF TOIL HAD FALLEN FROM HIS SHOULDERS FOR THE GIFTS THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME I THANK YOU HE SAID O LADY OF LORIEN OF WHOM WERE SPRUNG CELEBRIAN AND ARWEN EVENSTAR WHAT PRAISE COULD I SAY MORE

SAM WENT RED TO THE EARS AND MUTTERED SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS HE CLUTCHED THE BOX AND BOWED AS WELL AS HE COULD
AND WHAT GIFT WOULD A DWARF ASK OF THE ELVES SAID GALADRIEL TURNING TO GIMLI
NONE LADY ANSWERED GIMLI IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAVE SEEN THE LADY OF THE GALADHRIM AND TO HAVE HEARD HER GENTLE WORDS

THERE IS NOTHING LADY GALADRIEL SAID GIMLI BOWING LOW AND STAMMERING NOTHING UNLESS IT MIGHT BE  UNLESS IT IS PERMITTED TO ASK NAY TO NAME A SINGLE STRAND OF YOUR HAIR WHICH SURPASSES THE GOLD OF THE EARTH AS THE STARS SURPASS THE GEMS OF THE MINE I DO NOT ASK FOR SUCH A GIFT BUT YOU COMMANDED ME TO NAME MY DESIRE
THE ELVES STIRRED AND MURMURED WITH ASTONISHMENT AND CELEBORN GAZED AT THE DWARF IN WONDER BUT THE LADY SMILED IT IS SAID THAT THE SKILL OF THE DWARVES IS IN THEIR HANDS RATHER THAN IN THEIR TONGUES SHE SAID YET THAT IS NOT TRUE OF GIMLI FOR NONE HAVE EVER MADE TO ME A REQUEST SO BOLD AND YET SO COURTEOUS AND HOW SHALL I REFUSE SINCE I COMMANDED HIM TO SPEAK BUT TELL ME WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH SUCH A GIFT

THEN THE LADY UNBRAIDED ONE OF HER LONG TRESSES AND CUT OFF THREE GOLDEN HAIRS AND LAID THEM IN GIMLIS HAND THESE WORDS SHALL GO WITH THE GIFT SHE SAID I DO NOT FORETELL FOR ALL FORETELLING IS NOW VAIN ON THE ONE HAND LIES DARKNESS AND ON THE OTHER ONLY HOPE BUT IF HOPE SHOULD NOT FAIL THEN I SAY TO YOU GIMLI SON OF GLOIN THAT YOUR HANDS SHALL FLOW WITH GOLD AND YET OVER YOU GOLD SHALL HAVE NO DOMINION

FRODO TOOK THE PHIAL AND FOR A MOMENT AS IT SHONE BETWEEN THEM HE SAW HER AGAIN STANDING LIKE A QUEEN GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL BUT NO LONGER TERRIBLE HE BOWED BUT FOUND NO WORDS TO SAY
NOW THE LADY AROSE AND CELEBORN LED THEM BACK TO THE HYTHE A YELLOW NOON LAY ON THE GREEN LAND OF THE TONGUE AND THE WATER GLITTERED WITH SILVER ALL AT LAST WAS MADE READY THE COMPANY TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE BOATS AS BEFORE CRYING FAREWELL THE ELVES OF LORIEN WITH LONG GREY POLES THRUST THEM OUT INTO THE FLOWING STREAM AND THE RIPPLING WATERS BORE THEM SLOWLY AWAY THE TRAVELLERS SAT STILL WITHOUT MOVING OR SPEAKING ON THE GREEN BANK NEAR TO THE VERY POINT OF THE TONGUE THE LADY GALADRIEL STOOD ALONE AND SILENT AS THEY PASSED HER THEY TURNED AND THEIR EYES WATCHED HER SLOWLY FLOATING AWAY FROM THEM FOR SO IT SEEMED TO THEM LORIEN WAS SLIPPING BACKWARD LIKE A BRIGHT SHIP MASTED WITH ENCHANTED TREES SAILING ON TO FORGOTTEN SHORES WHILE THEY SAT HELPLESS UPON THE MARGIN OF THE GREY AND LEAFLESS WORLD
EVEN AS THEY GAZED THE SILVERLODE PASSED OUT INTO THE CURRENTS OF THE GREAT RIVER AND THEIR BOATS TURNED AND BEGAN TO SPEED SOUTHWARDS SOON THE WHITE FORM OF THE LADY WAS SMALL AND DISTANT SHE SHONE LIKE A WINDOW OF GLASS UPON A FAR HILL IN THE WESTERING SUN OR AS A REMOTE LAKE SEEN FROM A MOUNTAIN A CRYSTAL FALLEN IN THE LAP OF THE LAND THEN IT SEEMED TO FRODO THAT SHE LIFTED HER ARMS IN A FINAL FAREWELL AND FAR BUT PIERCINGCLEAR ON THE FOLLOWING WIND CAME THE SOUND OF HER VOICE SINGING BUT NOW SHE SANG IN THE ANCIENT TONGUE OF THE ELVES BEYOND THE SEA AND HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORDS FAIR WAS THE MUSIC BUT IT DID NOT COMFORT HIM
YET AS IS THE WAY OF ELVISH WORDS THEY REMAINED GRAVEN IN HIS MEMORY AND LONG AFTERWARDS HE INTERPRETED THEM AS WELL AS HE COULD THE LANGUAGE WAS THAT OF ELVENSONG AND SPOKE OF THINGS LITTLE KNOWN ON MIDDLEEARTH

AH LIKE GOLD FALL THE LEAVES IN THE WIND LONG YEARS NUMBERLESS AS THE WINGS OF TREES THE LONG YEARS HAVE PASSED LIKE SWIFT DRAUGHTS OF THE SWEET MEAD IN LOFTY HALLS BEYOND THE WEST BENEATH THE BLUE VAULTS OF VARDA WHEREIN THE STARS TREMBLE IN THE SONG OF HER VOICE HOLY AND QUEENLY WHO NOW SHALL REFILL THE CUP FOR ME FOR NOW THE KINDLER VARDA THE QUEEN OF THE STARS FROM MOUNT EVERWHITE HAS UPLIFTED HER HANDS LIKE CLOUDS AND ALL PATHS ARE DROWNED DEEP IN SHADOW AND OUT OF A GREY COUNTRY DARKNESS LIES ON THE FOAMING WAVES BETWEEN US AND MIST COVERS THE JEWELS OF CALACIRYA FOR EVER NOW LOST LOST TO THOSE FROM THE EAST IS VALIMAR FAREWELL MAYBE THOU SHALT FIND VALIMAR MAYBE EVEN THOU SHALT FIND IT FAREWELL VARDA IS THE NAME OF THAT LADY WHOM THE ELVES IN THESE LANDS OF EXILE NAME ELBERETH
SUDDENLY THE RIVER SWEPT ROUND A BEND AND THE BANKS ROSE UPON EITHER SIDE AND THE LIGHT OF LORIEN WAS HIDDEN TO THAT FAIR LAND FRODO NEVER CAME AGAIN
THE TRAVELLERS NOW TURNED THEIR FACES TO THE JOURNEY THE SUN WAS BEFORE THEM AND THEIR EYES WERE DAZZLED FOR ALL WERE FILLED WITH TEARS GIMLI WEPT OPENLY
I HAVE LOOKED THE LAST UPON THAT WHICH WAS FAIREST HE SAID TO LEGOLAS HIS COMPANION HENCEFORWARD I WILL CALL NOTHING FAIR UNLESS IT BE HER GIFT HE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS BREAST
TELL ME LEGOLAS WHY DID I COME ON THIS QUEST LITTLE DID I KNOW WHERE THE CHIEF PERIL LAY TRULY ELROND SPOKE SAYING THAT WE COULD NOT FORESEE WHAT WE MIGHT MEET UPON OUR ROAD TORMENT IN THE DARK WAS THE DANGER THAT I FEARED AND IT DID NOT HOLD ME BACK BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE COME HAD I KNOWN THE DANGER OF LIGHT AND JOY NOW I HAVE TAKEN MY WORST WOUND IN THIS PARTING EVEN IF I WERE TO GO THIS NIGHT STRAIGHT TO THE DARK LORD ALAS FOR GIMLI SON OF GLOIN
NAY SAID LEGOLAS ALAS FOR US ALL AND FOR ALL THAT WALK THE WORLD IN THESE AFTERDAYS FOR SUCH IS THE WAY OF IT TO FIND AND LOSE AS IT SEEMS TO THOSE WHOSE BOAT IS ON THE RUNNING STREAM BUT I COUNT YOU BLESSED GIMLI SON OF GLOIN FOR YOUR LOSS YOU SUFFER OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL AND YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN OTHERWISE BUT YOU HAVE NOT FORSAKEN YOUR COMPANIONS AND THE LEAST REWARD THAT YOU SHALL HAVE IS THAT THE MEMORY OF LOTHLORIEN SHALL REMAIN EVER CLEAR AND UNSTAINED IN YOUR HEART AND SHALL NEITHER FADE NOR GROW STALE
MAYBE SAID GIMLI AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORDS TRUE WORDS DOUBTLESS YET ALL SUCH COMFORT IS COLD MEMORY IS NOT WHAT THE HEART DESIRES THAT IS ONLY A MIRROR BE IT CLEAR AS KHELEDZARAM OR SO SAYS THE HEART OF GIMLI THE DWARF ELVES MAY SEE THINGS OTHERWISE INDEED I HAVE HEARD THAT FOR THEM MEMORY IS MORE LIKE TO THE WAKING WORLD THAN TO A DREAM NOT SO FOR DWARVES
BUT LET US TALK NO MORE OF IT LOOK TO THE BOAT SHE IS TOO LOW IN THE WATER WITH ALL THIS BAGGAGE AND THE GREAT RIVER IS SWIFT I DO NOT WISH TO DROWN MY GRIEF IN COLD WATER HE TOOK UP A PADDLE AND STEERED TOWARDS THE WESTERN BANK FOLLOWING ARAGORNS BOAT AHEAD WHICH HAD ALREADY MOVED OUT OF THE MIDDLE STREAM
SO THE COMPANY WENT ON THEIR LONG WAY DOWN THE WIDE HURRYING WATERS BORNE EVER SOUTHWARDS BARE WOODS STALKED ALONG EITHER BANK AND THEY COULD NOT SEE ANY GLIMPSE OF THE LANDS BEHIND THE BREEZE DIED AWAY AND THE RIVER FLOWED WITHOUT A SOUND NO VOICE OF BIRD BROKE THE SILENCE THE SUN GREW MISTY AS THE DAY GREW OLD UNTIL IT GLEAMED IN A PALE SKY LIKE A HIGH WHITE PEARL THEN IT FADED INTO THE WEST AND DUSK CAME EARLY FOLLOWED BY A GREY AND STARLESS NIGHT FAR INTO THE DARK QUIET HOURS THEY FLOATED ON GUIDING THEIR BOATS UNDER THE OVERHANGING SHADOWS OF THE WESTERN WOODS GREAT TREES PASSED BY LIKE GHOSTS THRUSTING THEIR TWISTED THIRSTY ROOTS THROUGH THE MIST DOWN INTO THE WATER IT WAS DREARY AND COLD FRODO SAT AND LISTENED TO THE FAINT LAP AND GURGLE OF THE RIVER FRETTING AMONG THE TREEROOTS AND DRIFTWOOD NEAR THE SHORE UNTIL HIS HEAD NODDED AND HE FELL INTO AN UNEASY SLEEP



CHAPTER 9
THE GREAT RIVER

FRODO WAS ROUSED BY SAM HE FOUND THAT HE WAS LYING WELL WRAPPED UNDER TALL GREYSKINNED TREES IN A QUIET CORNER OF THE WOODLANDS ON THE WEST BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER ANDUIN HE HAD SLEPT THE NIGHT AWAY AND THE GREY OF MORNING WAS DIM AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES GIMLI WAS BUSY WITH A SMALL FIRE NEAR AT HAND
THEY STARTED AGAIN BEFORE THE DAY WAS BROAD NOT THAT MOST OF THE COMPANY WERE EAGER TO HURRY SOUTHWARDS THEY WERE CONTENT THAT THE DECISION WHICH THEY MUST MAKE AT LATEST WHEN THEY CAME TO RAUROS AND THE TINDROCK ISLE STILL LAY SOME DAYS AHEAD AND THEY LET THE RIVER BEAR THEM ON AT ITS OWN PACE HAVING NO DESIRE TO HASTEN TOWARDS THE PERILS THAT LAY BEYOND WHICHEVER COURSE THEY TOOK IN THE END ARAGORN LET THEM DRIFT WITH THE STREAM AS THEY WISHED HUSBANDING THEIR STRENGTH AGAINST WEARINESS TO COME BUT HE INSISTED THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD START EARLY EACH DAY AND JOURNEY ON FAR INTO THE EVENING FOR HE FELT IN HIS HEART THAT TIME WAS PRESSING AND HE FEARED THAT THE DARK LORD HAD NOT BEEN IDLE WHILE THEY LINGERED IN LORIEN
NONETHELESS THEY SAW NO SIGN OF AN ENEMY THAT DAY NOR THE NEXT THE DULL GREY HOURS PASSED WITHOUT EVENT AS THE THIRD DAY OF THEIR VOYAGE WORE ON THE LANDS CHANGED SLOWLY THE TREES THINNED AND THEN FAILED ALTOGETHER ON THE EASTERN BANK TO THEIR LEFT THEY SAW LONG FORMLESS SLOPES STRETCHING UP AND AWAY TOWARD THE SKY BROWN AND WITHERED THEY LOOKED AS IF FIRE HAD PASSED OVER THEM LEAVING NO LIVING BLADE OF GREEN AN UNFRIENDLY WASTE WITHOUT EVEN A BROKEN TREE OR A BOLD STONE TO RELIEVE THE EMPTINESS THEY HAD COME TO THE BROWN LANDS THAT LAY VAST AND DESOLATE BETWEEN SOUTHERN MIRKWOOD AND THE HILLS OF THE EMYN MUIL WHAT PESTILENCE OR WAR OR EVIL DEED OF THE ENEMY HAD SO BLASTED ALL THAT REGION EVEN ARAGORN COULD NOT TELL
UPON THE WEST TO THEIR RIGHT THE LAND WAS TREELESS ALSO BUT IT WAS FLAT AND IN MANY PLACES GREEN WITH WIDE PLAINS OF GRASS ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THEY PASSED FORESTS OF GREAT REEDS SO TALL THAT THEY SHUT OUT ALL VIEW TO THE WEST AS THE LITTLE BOATS WENT RUSTLING BY ALONG THEIR FLUTTERING BORDERS THEIR DARK WITHERED PLUMES BENT AND TOSSED IN THE LIGHT COLD AIRS HISSING SOFTLY AND SADLY HERE AND THERE THROUGH OPENINGS FRODO COULD CATCH SUDDEN GLIMPSES OF ROLLING MEADS AND FAR BEYOND THEM HILLS IN THE SUNSET AND AWAY ON THE EDGE OF SIGHT A DARK LINE WHERE MARCHED THE SOUTHERNMOST RANKS OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIVING MOVING THINGS SAVE BIRDS OF THESE THERE WERE MANY SMALL FOWL WHISTLING AND PIPING IN THE REEDS BUT THEY WERE SELDOM SEEN ONCE OR TWICE THE TRAVELLERS HEARD THE RUSH AND WHINE OF SWANWINGS AND LOOKING UP THEY SAW A GREAT PHALANX STREAMING ALONG THE SKY
SWANS SAID SAM AND MIGHTY BIG ONES TOO
YES SAID ARAGORN AND THEY ARE BLACK SWANS
HOW WIDE AND EMPTY AND MOURNFUL ALL THIS COUNTRY LOOKS SAID FRODO I ALWAYS IMAGINED THAT AS ONE JOURNEYED SOUTH IT GOT WARMER AND MERRIER UNTIL WINTER WAS LEFT BEHIND FOR EVER
BUT WE HAVE NOT JOURNEYED FAR SOUTH YET ANSWERED ARAGORN IT IS STILL WINTER AND WE ARE FAR FROM THE SEA HERE THE WORLD IS COLD UNTIL THE SUDDEN SPRING AND WE MAY YET HAVE SNOW AGAIN FAR AWAY DOWN IN THE BAY OF BELFALAS TO WHICH ANDUIN RUNS IT IS WARM AND MERRY MAYBE OR WOULD BE BUT FOR THE ENEMY BUT HERE WE ARE NOT ABOVE SIXTY LEAGUES I GUESS SOUTH OF THE SOUTHFARTHING AWAY IN YOUR SHIRE HUNDREDS OF LONG MILES YONDER YOU ARE LOOKING NOW SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE NORTH PLAINS OF THE RIDDERMARK ROHAN THE LAND OF THE HORSELORDS ERE LONG WE SHALL COME TO THE MOUTH OF THE LIMLIGHT THAT RUNS DOWN FROM FANGORN TO JOIN THE GREAT RIVER THAT IS THE NORTH BOUNDARY OF ROHAN AND OF OLD ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN LIMLIGHT AND THE WHITE MOUNTAINS BELONGED TO THE ROHIRRIM IT IS A RICH AND PLEASANT LAND AND ITS GRASS HAS NO RIVAL BUT IN THESE EVIL DAYS FOLK DO NOT DWELL BY THE RIVER OR RIDE OFTEN TO ITS SHORES ANDUIN IS WIDE YET THE ORCS CAN SHOOT THEIR ARROWS FAR ACROSS THE STREAM AND OF LATE IT IS SAID THEY HAVE DARED TO CROSS THE WATER AND RAID THE HERDS AND STUDS OF ROHAN
SAM LOOKED FROM BANK TO BANK UNEASILY THE TREES HAD SEEMED HOSTILE BEFORE AS IF THEY HARBOURED SECRET EYES AND LURKING DANGERS NOW HE WISHED THAT THE TREES WERE STILL THERE HE FELT THAT THE COMPANY WAS TOO NAKED AFLOAT IN LITTLE OPEN BOATS IN THE MIDST OF SHELTERLESS LANDS AND ON A RIVER THAT WAS THE FRONTIER OF WAR
IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO AS THEY WENT ON BORNE STEADILY SOUTHWARDS THIS FEELING OF INSECURITY GREW ON ALL THE COMPANY FOR A WHOLE DAY THEY TOOK TO THEIR PADDLES AND HASTENED FORWARD THE BANKS SLID BY SOON THE RIVER BROADENED AND GREW MORE SHALLOW LONG STONY BEACHES LAY UPON THE EAST AND THERE WERE GRAVELSHOALS IN THE WATER SO THAT CAREFUL STEERING WAS NEEDED THE BROWN LANDS ROSE INTO BLEAK WOLDS OVER WHICH FLOWED A CHILL AIR FROM THE EAST ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MEADS HAD BECOME ROLLING DOWNS OF WITHERED GRASS AMIDST A LAND OF FEN AND TUSSOCK FRODO SHIVERED THINKING OF THE LAWNS AND FOUNTAINS THE CLEAR SUN AND GENTLE RAINS OF LOTHLORIEN THERE WAS LITTLE SPEECH AND NO LAUGHTER IN ANY OF THE BOATS EACH MEMBER OF THE COMPANY WAS BUSY WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS
THE HEART OF LEGOLAS WAS RUNNING UNDER THE STARS OF A SUMMER NIGHT IN SOME NORTHERN GLADE AMID THE BEECHWOODS GIMLI WAS FINGERING GOLD IN HIS MIND AND WONDERING IF IT WERE FIT TO BE WROUGHT INTO THE HOUSING OF THE LADYS GIFT MERRY AND PIPPIN IN THE MIDDLE BOAT WERE ILL AT EASE FOR BOROMIR SAT MUTTERING TO HIMSELF SOMETIMES BITING HIS NAILS AS IF SOME RESTLESSNESS OR DOUBT CONSUMED HIM SOMETIMES SEIZING A PADDLE AND DRIVING THE BOAT CLOSE BEHIND ARAGORNS THEN PIPPIN WHO SAT IN THE BOW LOOKING BACK CAUGHT A QUEER GLEAM IN HIS EYE AS HE PEERED FORWARD GAZING AT FRODO SAM HAD LONG AGO MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THOUGH BOATS WERE MAYBE NOT AS DANGEROUS AS HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THEY WERE FAR MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN EVEN HE HAD IMAGINED HE WAS CRAMPED AND MISERABLE HAVING NOTHING TO DO BUT STARE AT THE WINTERLANDS CRAWLING BY AND THE GREY WATER ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM EVEN WHEN THE PADDLES WERE IN USE THEY DID NOT TRUST SAM WITH ONE
AS DUSK DREW DOWN ON THE FOURTH DAY HE WAS LOOKING BACK OVER THE BOWED HEADS OF FRODO AND ARAGORN AND THE FOLLOWING BOATS HE WAS DROWSY AND LONGED FOR CAMP AND THE FEEL OF EARTH UNDER HIS TOES SUDDENLY SOMETHING CAUGHT HIS SIGHT AT FIRST HE STARED AT IT LISTLESSLY THEN HE SAT UP AND RUBBED HIS EYES BUT WHEN HE LOOKED AGAIN HE COULD NOT SEE IT ANY MORE
THAT NIGHT THEY CAMPED ON A SMALL EYOT CLOSE TO THE WESTERN BANK SAM LAY ROLLED IN BLANKETS BESIDE FRODO I HAD A FUNNY DREAM AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE WE STOPPED MR FRODO HE SAID OR MAYBE IT WASNT A DREAM FUNNY IT WAS ANYWAY
WELL WHAT WAS IT SAID FRODO KNOWING THAT SAM WOULD NOT SETTLE DOWN UNTIL HE HAD TOLD HIS TALE WHATEVER IT WAS I HAVENT SEEN OR THOUGHT OF ANYTHING TO MAKE ME SMILE SINCE WE LEFT LOTHLORIEN
IT WASNT FUNNY THAT WAY MR FRODO IT WAS QUEER ALL WRONG IF IT WASNT A DREAM AND YOU HAD BEST HEAR IT IT WAS LIKE THIS I SAW A LOG WITH EYES
THE LOGS ALL RIGHT SAID FRODO THERE ARE MANY IN THE RIVER BUT LEAVE OUT THE EYES
THAT I WONT SAID SAM TWAS THE EYES AS MADE ME SIT UP SO TO SPEAK I SAW WHAT I TOOK TO BE A LOG FLOATING ALONG IN THE HALFLIGHT BEHIND GIMLIS BOAT BUT I DIDNT GIVE MUCH HEED TO IT THEN IT SEEMED AS IF THE LOG WAS SLOWLY CATCHING US UP AND THAT WAS PECULIAR AS YOU MIGHT SAY SEEING AS WE WERE ALL FLOATING ON THE STREAM TOGETHER JUST THEN I SAW THE EYES TWO PALE SORT OF POINTS SHINYLIKE ON A HUMP AT THE NEAR END OF THE LOG WHATS MORE IT WASNT A LOG FOR IT HAD PADDLEFEET LIKE A SWANS ALMOST ONLY THEY SEEMED BIGGER AND KEPT DIPPING IN AND OUT OF THE WATER
THATS WHEN I SAT RIGHT UP AND RUBBED MY EYES MEANING TO GIVE A SHOUT IF IT WAS STILL THERE WHEN I HAD RUBBED THE DROWSE OUT OF MY HEAD FOR THE WHATEVERITWAS WAS COMING ALONG FAST NOW AND GETTING CLOSE BEHIND GIMLI BUT WHETHER THOSE TWO LAMPS SPOTTED ME MOVING AND STARING OR WHETHER I CAME TO MY SENSES I DONT KNOW WHEN I LOOKED AGAIN IT WASNT THERE YET I THINK I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE WITH THE TAIL OFMY EYE AS THE SAYING IS OF SOMETHING DARK SHOOTING UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE BANK I COULDNT SEE NO MORE EYES THOUGH
I SAID TO MYSELF DREAMING AGAIN SAM GAMGEE I SAID AND I SAID NO MORE JUST THEN BUT IVE BEEN THINKING SINCE AND NOW IM NOT SO SURE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT MR FRODO
I SHOULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT BUT A LOG AND THE DUSK AND SLEEP IN YOUR EYES SAM SAID FRODO IF THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THOSE EYES HAD BEEN SEEN BUT IT ISNT I SAW THEM AWAY BACK NORTH BEFORE WE REACHED LORIEN AND I SAW A STRANGE CREATURE WITH EYES CLIMBING TO THE FLET THAT NIGHT HALDIR SAW IT TOO AND DO YOU REMEMBER THE REPORT OF THE ELVES THAT WENT AFTER THE ORCBAND
AH SAID SAM I DO AND I REMEMBER MORE TOO I DONT LIKE MY THOUGHTS BUT THINKING OF ONE THING AND ANOTHER AND MR BILBOS STORIES AND ALL I FANCY I COULD PUT A NAME ON THE CREATURE AT A GUESS A NASTY NAME GOLLUM MAYBE
YES THAT IS WHAT I HAVE FEARED FOR SOME TIME SAID FRODO EVER SINCE THE NIGHT ON THE FLET I SUPPOSE HE WAS LURKING IN MORIA AND PICKED UP OUR TRAIL THEN BUT I HOPED THAT OUR STAY IN LORIEN WOULD THROW HIM OFF THE SCENT AGAIN THE MISERABLE CREATURE MUST HAVE BEEN HIDING IN THE WOODS BY THE SILVERLODE WATCHING US START OFF
THATS ABOUT IT SAID SAM AND WED BETTER BE A BIT MORE WATCHFUL OURSELVES OR WELL FEEL SOME NASTY FINGERS ROUND OUR NECKS ONE OF THESE NIGHTS IF WE EVER WAKE UP TO FEEL ANYTHING AND THATS WHAT I WAS LEADING UP TO NO NEED TO TROUBLE STRIDER OR THE OTHERS TONIGHT ILL KEEP WATCH I CAN SLEEP TOMORROW BEING NO MORE THAN LUGGAGE IN A BOAT AS YOU MIGHT SAY
I MIGHT SAID FRODO AND I MIGHT SAY LUGGAGE WITH EYES YOU SHALL WATCH BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO WAKE ME HALFWAY TOWARDS MORNING IF NOTHING HAPPENS BEFORE THEN
IN THE DEAD HOURS FRODO CAME OUT OF A DEEP DARK SLEEP TO FIND SAM SHAKING HIM ITS A SHAME TO WAKE YOU WHISPERED SAM BUT THATS WHAT YOU SAID THERES NOTHING TO TELL OR NOT MUCH I THOUGHT I HEARD SOME SOFT PLASHING AND A SNIFFING NOISE A WHILE BACK BUT YOU HEAR A LOT OF SUCH QUEER SOUNDS BY A RIVER AT NIGHT
HE LAY DOWN AND FRODO SAT UP HUDDLED IN HIS BLANKETS AND FOUGHT OFF HIS SLEEP MINUTES OR HOURS PASSED SLOWLY AND NOTHING HAPPENED FRODO WAS JUST YIELDING TO THE TEMPTATION TO LIE DOWN AGAIN WHEN A DARK SHAPE HARDLY VISIBLE FLOATED CLOSE TO ONE OF THE MOORED BOATS A LONG WHITISH HAND COULD BE DIMLY SEEN AS IT SHOT OUT AND GRABBED THE GUNWALE TWO PALE LAMPLIKE EYES SHONE COLDLY AS THEY PEERED INSIDE AND THEN THEY LIFTED AND GAZED UP AT FRODO ON THE EYOT THEY WERE NOT MORE THAN A YARD OR TWO AWAY AND FRODO HEARD THE SOFT HISS OF INTAKEN BREATH HE STOOD UP DRAWING STING FROM ITS SHEATH AND FACED THE EYES IMMEDIATELY THEIR LIGHT WAS SHUT OFF THERE WAS ANOTHER HISS AND A SPLASH AND THE DARK LOGSHAPE SHOT AWAY DOWNSTREAM INTO THE NIGHT ARAGORN STIRRED IN HIS SLEEP TURNED OVER AND SAT UP
WHAT IS IT HE WHISPERED SPRINGING UP AND COMING TO FRODO I FELT SOMETHING IN MY SLEEP WHY HAVE YOU DRAWN YOUR SWORD
GOLLUM ANSWERED FRODO OR AT LEAST SO I GUESS
AH SAID ARAGORN SO YOU KNOW ABOUT OUR LITTLE FOOTPAD DO YOU HE PADDED AFTER US ALL THROUGH MORIA AND RIGHT DOWN TO NIMRODEL SINCE WE TOOK TO BOATS HE HAS BEEN LYING ON A LOG AND PADDLING WITH HANDS AND FEET I HAVE TRIED TO CATCH HIM ONCE OR TWICE AT NIGHT BUT HE IS SLIER THAN A FOX AND AS SLIPPERY AS A FISH I HOPED THE RIVERVOYAGE WOULD BEAT HIM BUT HE IS TOO CLEVER A WATERMAN
WE SHALL HAVE TO TRY GOING FASTER TOMORROW YOU LIE DOWN NOW AND I WILL KEEP WATCH FOR WHAT IS LEFT OF THE NIGHT I WISH I COULD LAY MY HANDS ON THE WRETCH WE MIGHT MAKE HIM USEFUL BUT IF I CANNOT WE SHALL HAVE TO TRY AND LOSE HIM HE IS VERY DANGEROUS QUITE APART FROM MURDER BY NIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE MAY PUT ANY ENEMY THAT IS ABOUT ON OUR TRACK
THE NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT GOLLUM SHOWING SO MUCH AS A SHADOW AGAIN AFTER THAT THE COMPANY KEPT A SHARP LOOKOUT BUT THEY SAW NO MORE OF GOLLUM WHILE THE VOYAGE LASTED IF HE WAS STILL FOLLOWING HE WAS VERY WARY AND CUNNING AT ARAGORNS BIDDING THEY PADDLED NOW FOR LONG SPELLS AND THE BANKS WENT SWIFTLY BY BUT THEY SAW LITTLE OF THE COUNTRY FOR THEY JOURNEYED MOSTLY BY NIGHT AND TWILIGHT RESTING BY DAY AND LYING AS HIDDEN AS THE LAND ALLOWED IN THIS WAY THE TIME PASSED WITHOUT EVENT UNTIL THE SEVENTH DAY
THE WEATHER WAS STILL GREY AND OVERCAST WITH WIND FROM THE EAST BUT AS EVENING DREW INTO NIGHT THE SKY AWAY WESTWARD CLEARED AND POOLS OF FAINT LIGHT YELLOW AND PALE GREEN OPENED UNDER THE GREY SHORES OF CLOUD THERE THE WHITE RIND OF THE NEW MOON COULD BE SEEN GLIMMERING IN THE REMOTE LAKES SAM LOOKED AT IT AND PUCKERED HIS BROWS
THE NEXT DAY THE COUNTRY ON EITHER SIDE BEGAN TO CHANGE RAPIDLY THE BANKS BEGAN TO RISE AND GROW STONY SOON THEY WERE PASSING THROUGH A HILLY ROCKY LAND AND ON BOTH SHORES THERE WERE STEEP SLOPES BURIED IN DEEP BRAKES OF THORN AND SLOE TANGLED WITH BRAMBLES AND CREEPERS BEHIND THEM STOOD LOW CRUMBLING CLIFFS AND CHIMNEYS OF GREY WEATHERED STONE DARK WITH IVY AND BEYOND THESE AGAIN THERE ROSE HIGH RIDGES CROWNED WITH WINDWRITHEN FIRS THEY WERE DRAWING NEAR TO THE GREY HILLCOUNTRY OF THE EMYN MUIL THE SOUTHERN MARCH OF WILDERLAND
THERE WERE MANY BIRDS ABOUT THE CLIFFS AND THE ROCKCHIMNEYS AND ALL DAY HIGH IN THE AIR FLOCKS OF BIRDS HAD BEEN CIRCLING BLACK AGAINST THE PALE SKY AS THEY LAY IN THEIR CAMP THAT DAY ARAGORN WATCHED THE FLIGHTS DOUBTFULLY WONDERING IF GOLLUM HAD BEEN DOING SOME MISCHIEF AND THE NEWS OF THEIR VOYAGE WAS NOW MOVING IN THE WILDERNESS LATER AS THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE COMPANY WAS STIRRING AND GETTING READY TO START AGAIN HE DESCRIED A DARK SPOT AGAINST THE FADING LIGHT A GREAT BIRD HIGH AND FAR OFF NOW WHEELING NOW FLYING ON SLOWLY SOUTHWARDS
WHAT IS THAT LEGOLAS HE ASKED POINTING TO THE NORTHERN SKY IS IT AS I THINK AN EAGLE
YES SAID LEGOLAS IT IS AN EAGLE A HUNTING EAGLE I WONDER WHAT THAT FOREBODES IT IS FAR FROM THE MOUNTAINS
WE WILL NOT START UNTIL IT IS FULLY DARK SAID ARAGORN
THE EIGHTH NIGHT OF THEIR JOURNEY CAME IT WAS SILENT AND WINDLESS THE GREY EAST WIND HAD PASSED AWAY THE THIN CRESCENT OF THE MOON HAD FALLEN EARLY INTO THE PALE SUNSET BUT THE SKY WAS CLEAR ABOVE AND THOUGH FAR AWAY IN THE SOUTH THERE WERE GREAT RANGES OF CLOUD THAT STILL SHONE FAINTLY IN THE WEST STARS GLINTED BRIGHT
COME SAID ARAGORN WE WILL VENTURE ONE MORE JOURNEY BY NIGHT WE ARE COMING TO REACHES OF THE RIVER THAT I DO NOT KNOW WELL FOR I HAVE NEVER JOURNEYED BY WATER IN THESE PARTS BEFORE NOT BETWEEN HERE AND THE RAPIDS OF SARN GEBIR BUT IF I AM RIGHT IN MY RECKONING THOSE ARE STILL MANY MILES AHEAD STILL THERE ARE DANGEROUS PLACES EVEN BEFORE WE COME THERE ROCKS AND STONY EYOTS IN THE STREAM WE MUST KEEP A SHARP WATCH AND NOT TRY TO PADDLE SWIFTLY
TO SAM IN THE LEADING BOAT WAS GIVEN THE TASK OF WATCHMAN HE LAY FORWARD PEERING INTO THE GLOOM THE NIGHT GREW DARK BUT THE STARS ABOVE WERE STRANGELY BRIGHT AND THERE WAS A GLIMMER ON THE FACE OF THE RIVER IT WAS CLOSE ON MIDNIGHT AND THEY HAD BEEN DRIFTING FOR SOME WHILE HARDLY USING THE PADDLES WHEN SUDDENLY SAM CRIED OUT ONLY A FEW YARDS AHEAD DARK SHAPES LOOMED UP IN THE STREAM AND HE HEARD THE SWIRL OF RACING WATER THERE WAS A SWIFT CURRENT WHICH SWUNG LEFT TOWARDS THE EASTERN SHORE WHERE THE CHANNEL WAS CLEAR AS THEY WERE SWEPT ASIDE THE TRAVELLERS COULD SEE NOW VERY CLOSE THE PALE FOAM OF THE RIVER LASHING AGAINST SHARP ROCKS THAT WERE THRUST OUT FAR INTO THE STREAM LIKE A RIDGE OF TEETH THE BOATS WERE ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER
HOY THERE ARAGORN SHOUTED BOROMIR AS HIS BOAT BUMPED INTO THE LEADER THIS IS MADNESS WE CANNOT DARE THE RAPIDS BY NIGHT BUT NO BOAT CAN LIVE IN SARN GEBIR BE IT NIGHT OR DAY
BACK BACK CRIED ARAGORN TURN TURN IF YOU CAN HE DROVE HIS PADDLE INTO THE WATER TRYING TO HOLD THE BOAT AND BRING IT ROUND
I AM OUT OF MY RECKONING HE SAID TO FRODO I DID NOT KNOW THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR ANDUIN FLOWS FASTER THAN I THOUGHT SARN GEBIR MUST BE CLOSE AT HAND ALREADY
WITH GREAT EFFORTS THEY CHECKED THE BOATS AND SLOWLY BROUGHT THEM ABOUT BUT AT FIRST THEY COULD MAKE ONLY SMALL HEADWAY AGAINST THE CURRENT AND ALL THE TIME THEY WERE CARRIED NEARER AND NEARER TO THE EASTERN BANK NOW DARK AND OMINOUS IT LOOMED UP IN THE NIGHT
ALL TOGETHER PADDLE SHOUTED BOROMIR PADDLE OR WE SHALL BE DRIVEN ON THE SHOALS EVEN AS HE SPOKE FRODO FELT THE KEEL BENEATH HIM GRATE UPON STONE
AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A TWANG OF BOWSTRINGS SEVERAL ARROWS WHISTLED OVER THEM AND SOME FELL AMONG THEM ONE SMOTE FRODO BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS AND HE LURCHED FORWARD WITH A CRY LETTING GO HIS PADDLE BUT THE ARROW FELL BACK FOILED BY HIS HIDDEN COAT OF MAIL ANOTHER PASSED THROUGH ARAGORNS HOOD AND A THIRD STOOD FAST IN THE GUNWALE OF THE SECOND BOAT CLOSE BY MERRYS HAND SAM THOUGHT HE COULD GLIMPSE BLACK FIGURES RUNNING TO AND FRO UPON THE LONG SHINGLEBANKS THAT LAY UNDER THE EASTERN SHORE THEY SEEMED VERY NEAR
YRCH SAID LEGOLAS FALLING INTO HIS OWN TONGUE
ORCS CRIED GIMLI
GOLLUMS DOING ILL BE BOUND SAID SAM TO FRODO AND A NICE PLACE TO CHOOSE TOO THE RIVER SEEMS SET ON TAKING US RIGHT INTO THEIR ARMS
THEY ALL LEANED FORWARD STRAINING AT THE PADDLES EVEN SAM TOOK A HAND EVERY MOMENT THEY EXPECTED TO FEEL THE BITE OF BLACKFEATHERED ARROWS MANY WHINED OVERHEAD OR STRUCK THE WATER NEARBY BUT THERE WERE NO MORE HITS IT WAS DARK BUT NOT TOO DARK FOR THE NIGHTEYES OF ORCS AND IN THE STARGLIMMER THEY MUST HAVE OFFERED THEIR CUNNING FOES SOME MARK UNLESS IT WAS THAT THE GREY CLOAKS OF LORIEN AND THE GREY TIMBER OF THE ELFWROUGHT BOATS DEFEATED THE MALICE OF THE ARCHERS OF MORDOR
STROKE BY STROKE THEY LABOURED ON IN THE DARKNESS IT WAS HARD TO BE SURE THAT THEY WERE INDEED MOVING AT ALL BUT SLOWLY THE SWIRL OF THE WATER GREW LESS AND THE SHADOW OF THE EASTERN BANK FADED BACK INTO THE NIGHT AT LAST AS FAR AS THEY COULD JUDGE THEY HAD REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM AGAIN AND HAD DRIVEN THEIR BOATS BACK SOME DISTANCE ABOVE THE JUTTING ROCKS THEN HALF TURNING THEY THRUST THEM WITH ALL THEIR STRENGTH TOWARDS THE WESTERN SHORE UNDER THE SHADOW OF BUSHES LEANING OUT OVER THE WATER THEY HALTED AND DREW BREATH
LEGOLAS LAID DOWN HIS PADDLE AND TOOK UP THE BOW THAT HE HAD BROUGHT FROM LORIEN THEN HE SPRANG ASHORE AND CLIMBED A FEW PACES UP THE BANK STRINGING THE BOW AND FITTING AN ARROW HE TURNED PEERING BACK OVER THE RIVER INTO THE DARKNESS ACROSS THE WATER THERE WERE SHRILL CRIES BUT NOTHING COULD BE SEEN
FRODO LOOKED UP AT THE ELF STANDING TALL ABOVE HIM AS HE GAZED INTO THE NIGHT SEEKING A MARK TO SHOOT AT HIS HEAD WAS DARK CROWNED WITH SHARP WHITE STARS THAT GLITTERED IN THE BLACK POOLS OF THE SKY BEHIND BUT NOW RISING AND SAILING UP FROM THE SOUTH THE GREAT CLOUDS ADVANCED SENDING OUT DARK OUTRIDERS INTO THE STARRY FIELDS A SUDDEN DREAD FELL ON THE COMPANY
ELBERETH GILTHONIEL SIGHED LEGOLAS AS HE LOOKED UP EVEN AS HE DID SO A DARK SHAPE LIKE A CLOUD AND YET NOT A CLOUD FOR IT MOVED FAR MORE SWIFTLY CAME OUT OF THE BLACKNESS IN THE SOUTH AND SPED TOWARDS THE COMPANY BLOTTING OUT ALL LIGHT AS IT APPROACHED SOON IT APPEARED AS A GREAT WINGED CREATURE BLACKER THAN THE PITS IN THE NIGHT FIERCE VOICES ROSE UP TO GREET IT FROM ACROSS THE WATER FRODO FELT A SUDDEN CHILL RUNNING THROUGH HIM AND CLUTCHING AT HIS HEART THERE WAS A DEADLY COLD LIKE THE MEMORY OF AN OLD WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER HE CROUCHED DOWN AS IF TO HIDE
SUDDENLY THE GREAT BOW OF LORIEN SANG SHRILL WENT THE ARROW FROM THE ELVENSTRING FRODO LOOKED UP ALMOST ABOVE HIM THE WINGED SHAPE SWERVED THERE WAS A HARSH CROAKING SCREAM AS IT FELL OUT OF THE AIR VANISHING DOWN INTO THE GLOOM OF THE EASTERN SHORE THE SKY WAS CLEAN AGAIN THERE WAS A TUMULT OF MANY VOICES FAR AWAY CURSING AND WAILING IN THE DARKNESS AND THEN SILENCE NEITHER SHAFT NOR CRY CAME AGAIN FROM THE EAST THAT NIGHT
AFTER A WHILE ARAGORN LED THE BOATS BACK UPSTREAM THEY FELT THEIR WAY ALONG THE WATERS EDGE FOR SOME DISTANCE UNTIL THEY FOUND A SMALL SHALLOW BAY A FEW LOW TREES GREW THERE CLOSE TO THE WATER AND BEHIND THEM ROSE A STEEP ROCKY BANK HERE THE COMPANY DECIDED TO STAY AND AWAIT THE DAWN IT WAS USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO MOVE FURTHER BY NIGHT THEY MADE NO CAMP AND LIT NO FIRE BUT LAY HUDDLED IN THE BOATS MOORED CLOSE TOGETHER
PRAISED BE THE BOW OF GALADRIEL AND THE HAND AND EYE OF LEGOLAS SAID GIMLI AS HE MUNCHED A WAFER OF LEMBAS THAT WAS A MIGHTY SHOT IN THE DARK MY FRIEND
BUT WHO CAN SAY WHAT IT HIT SAID LEGOLAS
I CANNOT SAID GIMLI BUT I AM GLAD THAT THE SHADOW CAME NO NEARER I LIKED IT NOT AT ALL TOO MUCH IT REMINDED ME OF THE SHADOW IN MORIA  THE SHADOW OF THE BALROG HE ENDED IN A WHISPER
IT WAS NOT A BALROG SAID FRODO STILL SHIVERING WITH THE CHILL THAT HAD COME UPON HIM IT WAS SOMETHING COLDER I THINK IT WAS  THEN HE PAUSED AND FELL SILENT
WHAT DO YOU THINK ASKED BOROMIR EAGERLY LEANING FROM HIS BOAT AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF FRODOS FACE
I THINK  NO I WILL NOT SAY ANSWERED FRODO WHATEVER IT WAS ITS FALL HAS DISMAYED OUR ENEMIES
SO IT SEEMS SAID ARAGORN YET WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW MANY AND WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT WE DO NOT KNOW THIS NIGHT WE MUST ALL BE SLEEPLESS DARK HIDES US NOW BUT WHAT THE DAY WILL SHOW WHO CAN TELL HAVE YOUR WEAPONS CLOSE TO HAND
SAM SAT TAPPING THE HILT OF HIS SWORD AS IF HE WERE COUNTING ON HIS FINGERS AND LOOKING UP AT THE SKY ITS VERY STRANGE HE MURMURED THE MOONS THE SAME IN THE SHIRE AND IN WILDERLAND OR IT OUGHT TO BE BUT EITHER ITS OUT OF ITS RUNNING OR IM ALL WRONG IN MY RECKONING YOULL REMEMBER MR FRODO THE MOON WAS WANING AS WE LAY ON THE FLET UP IN THAT TREE A WEEK FROM THE FULL I RECKON AND WED BEEN A WEEK ON THE WAY LAST NIGHT WHEN UP POPS A NEW MOON AS THIN AS A NAILPARING AS IF WE HAD NEVER STAYED NO TIME IN THE ELVISH COUNTRY
WELL I CAN REMEMBER THREE NIGHTS THERE FOR CERTAIN AND I SEEM TO REMEMBER SEVERAL MORE BUT I WOULD TAKE MY OATH IT WAS NEVER A WHOLE MONTH ANYONE WOULD THINK THAT TIME DID NOT COUNT IN THERE
AND PERHAPS THAT WAS THE WAY OF IT SAID FRODO IN THAT LAND MAYBE WE WERE IN A TIME THAT HAS ELSEWHERE LONG GONE BY IT WAS NOT I THINK UNTIL SILVERLODE BORE US BACK TO ANDUIN THAT WE RETURNED TO THE TIME THAT FLOWS THROUGH MORTAL LANDS TO THE GREAT SEA AND I DONT REMEMBER ANY MOON EITHER NEW OR OLD IN CARAS GALADHON ONLY STARS BY NIGHT AND SUN BY DAY
LEGOLAS STIRRED IN HIS BOAT NAY TIME DOES NOT TARRY EVER HE SAID BUT CHANGE AND GROWTH IS NOT IN ALL THINGS AND PLACES ALIKE FOR THE ELVES THE WORLD MOVES AND IT MOVES BOTH VERY SWIFT AND VERY SLOW SWIFT BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES CHANGE LITTLE AND ALL ELSE FLEETS BY IT IS A GRIEF TO THEM SLOW BECAUSE THEY DO NOT COUNT THE RUNNING YEARS NOT FOR THEMSELVES THE PASSING SEASONS ARE BUT RIPPLES EVER REPEATED IN THE LONG LONG STREAM YET BENEATH THE SUN ALL THINGS MUST WEAR TO AN END AT LAST
BUT THE WEARING IS SLOW IN LORIEN SAID FRODO THE POWER OF THE LADY IS ON IT RICH ARE THE HOURS THOUGH SHORT THEY SEEM IN CARAS GALADHON WHERE GALADRIEL WIELDS THE ELVENRING
THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SAID OUTSIDE LORIEN NOT EVEN TO ME SAID ARAGORN SPEAK NO MORE OF IT BUT SO IT IS SAM IN THAT LAND YOU LOST YOUR COUNT THERE TIME FLOWED SWIFTLY BY US AS FOR THE ELVES THE OLD MOON PASSED AND A NEW MOON WAXED AND WANED IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE WHILE WE TARRIED THERE AND YESTEREVE A NEW MOON CAME AGAIN WINTER IS NEARLY GONE TIME FLOWS ON TO A SPRING OF LITTLE HOPE
THE NIGHT PASSED SILENTLY NO VOICE OR CALL WAS HEARD AGAIN ACROSS THE WATER THE TRAVELLERS HUDDLED IN THEIR BOATS FELT THE CHANGING OF THE WEATHER THE AIR GREW WARM AND VERY STILL UNDER THE GREAT MOIST CLOUDS THAT HAD FLOATED UP FROM THE SOUTH AND THE DISTANT SEAS THE RUSHING OF THE RIVER OVER THE ROCKS OF THE RAPIDS SEEMED TO GROW LOUDER AND CLOSER THE TWIGS OF THE TREES ABOVE THEM BEGAN TO DRIP
WHEN THE DAY CAME THE MOOD OF THE WORLD ABOUT THEM HAD BECOME SOFT AND SAD SLOWLY THE DAWN GREW TO A PALE LIGHT DIFFUSED AND SHADOWLESS THERE WAS MIST ON THE RIVER AND WHITE FOG SWATHED THE SHORE THE FAR BANK COULD NOT BE SEEN
I CANT ABIDE FOG SAID SAM BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE A LUCKY ONE NOW PERHAPS WE CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT THOSE CURSED GOBLINS SEEING US
PERHAPS SO SAID ARAGORN BUT IT WILL BE HARD TO FIND THE PATH UNLESS THE FOG LIFTS A LITTLE LATER ON AND WE MUST FIND THE PATH IF WE ARE TO PASS SARN GEBIR AND COME TO THE EMYN MUIL
I DO NOT SEE WHY WE SHOULD PASS THE RAPIDS OR FOLLOW THE RIVER ANY FURTHER SAID BOROMIR IF THE EMYN MUIL LIE BEFORE US THEN WE CAN ABANDON THESE COCKLEBOATS AND STRIKE WESTWARD AND SOUTHWARD UNTIL WE COME TO THE ENTWASH AND CROSS INTO MY OWN LAND
WE CAN IF WE ARE MAKING FOR MINAS TIRITH SAID ARAGORN BUT THAT IS NOT YET AGREED AND SUCH A COURSE MAY BE MORE PERILOUS THAN IT SOUNDS THE VALE OF ENTWASH IS FLAT AND FENNY AND FOG IS A DEADLY PERIL THERE FOR THOSE ON FOOT AND LADEN I WOULD NOT ABANDON OUR BOATS UNTIL WE MUST THE RIVER IS AT LEAST A PATH THAT CANNOT BE MISSED
BUT THE ENEMY HOLDS THE EASTERN BANK OBJECTED BOROMIR AND EVEN IF YOU PASS THE GATES OF ARGONATH AND COME UNMOLESTED TO THE TINDROCK WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN LEAP DOWN THE FALLS AND LAND IN THE MARSHES
NO ANSWERED ARAGORN SAY RATHER THAT WE WILL BEAR OUR BOATS BY THE ANCIENT WAY TO RAUROSFOOT AND THERE TAKE TO THE WATER AGAIN DO YOU NOT KNOW BOROMIR OR DO YOU CHOOSE TO FORGET THE NORTH STAIR AND THE HIGH SEAT UPON AMON HEN THAT WERE MADE IN THE DAYS OF THE GREAT KINGS I AT LEAST HAVE A MIND TO STAND IN THAT HIGH PLACE AGAIN BEFORE I DECIDE MY FURTHER COURSE THERE MAYBE WE SHALL SEE SOME SIGN THAT WILL GUIDE US
BOROMIR HELD OUT LONG AGAINST THIS CHOICE BUT WHEN IT BECAME PLAIN THAT FRODO WOULD FOLLOW ARAGORN WHEREVER HE WENT HE GAVE IN IT IS NOT THE WAY OF THE MEN OF MINAS TIRITH TO DESERT THEIR FRIENDS AT NEED HE SAID AND YOU WILL NEED MY STRENGTH IF EVER YOU ARE TO REACH THE TINDROCK TO THE TALL ISLE I WILL GO BUT NO FURTHER THERE I SHALL TURN TO MY HOME ALONE IF MY HELP HAS NOT EARNED THE REWARD OF ANY COMPANIONSHIP
THE DAY WAS NOW GROWING AND THE FOG HAD LIFTED A LITTLE IT WAS DECIDED THAT ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS SHOULD AT ONCE GO FORWARD ALONG THE SHORE WHILE THE OTHERS REMAINED BY THE BOATS ARAGORN HOPED TO FIND SOME WAY BY WHICH THEY COULD CARRY BOTH THEIR BOATS AND THEIR BAGGAGE TO THE SMOOTHER WATER BEYOND THE RAPIDS
BOATS OF THE ELVES WOULD NOT SINK MAYBE HE SAID BUT THAT DOES NOT SAY THAT WE SHOULD COME THROUGH SARN GEBIR ALIVE NONE HAVE EVER DONE SO YET NO ROAD WAS MADE BY THE MEN OF GONDOR IN THIS REGION FOR EVEN IN THEIR GREAT DAYS THEIR REALM DID NOT REACH UP ANDUIN BEYOND THE EMYN MUIL BUT THERE IS A PORTAGEWAY SOMEWHERE ON THE WESTERN SHORE IF I CAN FIND IT IT CANNOT YET HAVE PERISHED FOR LIGHT BOATS USED TO JOURNEY OUT OF WILDERLAND DOWN TO OSGILIATH AND STILL DID SO UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE ORCS OF MORDOR BEGAN TO MULTIPLY
SELDOM IN MY LIFE HAS ANY BOAT COME OUT OF THE NORTH AND THE ORCS PROWL ON THE EASTSHORE SAID BOROMIR IF YOU GO FORWARD PERIL WILL GROW WITH EVERY MILE EVEN IF YOU FIND A PATH
PERIL LIES AHEAD ON EVERY SOUTHWARD ROAD ANSWERED ARAGORN WAIT FOR US ONE DAY IF WE DO NOT RETURN IN THAT TIME YOU WILL KNOW THAT EVIL HAS INDEED BEFALLEN US THEN YOU MUST TAKE A NEW LEADER AND FOLLOW HIM AS BEST YOU CAN
IT WAS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT FRODO SAW ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS CLIMB THE STEEP BANK AND VANISH INTO THE MISTS BUT HIS FEARS PROVED GROUNDLESS ONLY TWO OR THREE HOURS HAD PASSED AND IT WAS BARELY MIDDAY WHEN THE SHADOWY SHAPES OF THE EXPLORERS APPEARED AGAIN
ALL IS WELL SAID ARAGORN AS HE CLAMBERED DOWN THE BANK THERE IS A TRACK AND IT LEADS TO A GOOD LANDING THAT IS STILL SERVICEABLE THE DISTANCE IS NOT GREAT THE HEAD OF THE RAPIDS IS BUT HALF A MILE BELOW US AND THEY ARE LITTLE MORE THAN A MILE LONG NOT FAR BEYOND THEM THE STREAM BECOMES CLEAR AND SMOOTH AGAIN THOUGH IT RUNS SWIFTLY OUR HARDEST TASK WILL BE TO GET OUR BOATS AND BAGGAGE TO THE OLD PORTAGEWAY WE HAVE FOUND IT BUT IT LIES WELL BACK FROM THE WATERSIDE HERE AND RUNS UNDER THE LEE OF A ROCKWALL A FURLONG OR MORE FROM THE SHORE WE DID NOT FIND WHERE THE NORTHWARD LANDING LIES IF IT STILL REMAINS WE MUST HAVE PASSED IT YESTERDAY NIGHT WE MIGHT LABOUR FAR UPSTREAM AND YET MISS IT IN THE FOG I FEAR WE MUST LEAVE THE RIVER NOW AND MAKE FOR THE PORTAGEWAY AS BEST WE CAN FROM HERE
THAT WOULD NOT BE EASY EVEN IF WE WERE ALL MEN SAID BOROMIR
YET SUCH AS WE ARE WE WILL TRY IT SAID ARAGORN
AYE WE WILL SAID GIMLI THE LEGS OF MEN WILL LAG ON A ROUGH ROAD WHILE A DWARF GOES ON BE THE BURDEN TWICE HIS OWN WEIGHT MASTER BOROMIR
THE TASK PROVED HARD INDEED YET IN THE END IT WAS DONE THE GOODS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE BOATS AND BROUGHT TO THE TOP OF THE BANK WHERE THERE WAS A LEVEL SPACE THEN THE BOATS WERE DRAWN OUT OF THE WATER AND CARRIED UP THEY WERE FAR LESS HEAVY THAN ANY HAD EXPECTED OF WHAT TREE GROWING IN THE ELVISH COUNTRY THEY WERE MADE NOT EVEN LEGOLAS KNEW BUT THE WOOD WAS TOUGH AND YET STRANGELY LIGHT MERRY AND PIPPIN ALONE COULD CARRY THEIR BOAT WITH EASE ALONG THE FLAT NONETHELESS IT NEEDED THE STRENGTH OF THE TWO MEN TO LIFT AND HAUL THEM OVER THE GROUND THAT THE COMPANY NOW HAD TO CROSS IT SLOPED UP AWAY FROM THE RIVER A TUMBLED WASTE OF GREY LIMESTONEBOULDERS WITH MANY HIDDEN HOLES SHROUDED WITH WEEDS AND BUSHES THERE WERE THICKETS OF BRAMBLES AND SHEER DELLS AND HERE AND THERE BOGGY POOLS FED BY WATERS TRICKLING FROM THE TERRACES FURTHER INLAND
ONE BY ONE BOROMIR AND ARAGORN CARRIED THE BOATS WHILE THE OTHERS TOILED AND SCRAMBLED AFTER THEM WITH THE BAGGAGE AT LAST ALL WAS REMOVED AND LAID ON THE PORTAGEWAY THEN WITH LITTLE FURTHER HINDRANCE SAVE FROM SPRAWLING BRIARS AND MANY FALLEN STONES THEY MOVED FORWARD ALL TOGETHER FOG STILL HUNG IN VEILS UPON THE CRUMBLING ROCKWALL AND TO THEIR LEFT MIST SHROUDED THE RIVER THEY COULD HEAR IT RUSHING AND FOAMING OVER THE SHARP SHELVES AND STONY TEETH OF SARN GEBIR BUT THEY COULD NOT SEE IT TWICE THEY MADE THE JOURNEY BEFORE ALL WAS BROUGHT SAFE TO THE SOUTHERN LANDING
THERE THE PORTAGEWAY TURNING BACK TO THE WATERSIDE RAN GENTLY DOWN TO THE SHALLOW EDGE OF A LITTLE POOL IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SCOOPED IN THE RIVERSIDE NOT BY HAND BUT BY THE WATER SWIRLING DOWN FROM SARN GEBIR AGAINST A LOW PIER OF ROCK THAT JUTTED OUT SOME WAY INTO THE STREAM BEYOND IT THE SHORE ROSE SHEER INTO A GREY CLIFF AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER PASSAGE FOR THOSE ON FOOT
ALREADY THE SHORT AFTERNOON WAS PAST AND A DIM CLOUDY DUSK WAS CLOSING IN THEY SAT BESIDE THE WATER LISTENING TO THE CONFUSED RUSH AND ROAR OF THE RAPIDS HIDDEN IN THE MIST THEY WERE TIRED AND SLEEPY AND THEIR HEARTS WERE AS GLOOMY AS THE DYING DAY
WELL HERE WE ARE AND HERE WE MUST PASS ANOTHER NIGHT SAID BOROMIR WE NEED SLEEP AND EVEN IF ARAGORN HAD A MIND TO PASS THE GATES OF ARGONATH BY NIGHT WE ARE ALL TOO TIRED  EXCEPT NO DOUBT OUR STURDY DWARF
GIMLI MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NODDING AS HE SAT
LET US REST AS MUCH AS WE CAN NOW SAID ARAGORN TOMORROW WE MUST JOURNEY BY DAY AGAIN UNLESS THE WEATHER CHANGES ONCE MORE AND CHEATS US WE SHALL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF SLIPPING THROUGH UNSEEN BY ANY EYES ON THE EASTERN SHORE BUT TONIGHT TWO MUST WATCH TOGETHER IN TURNS THREE HOURS OFF AND ONE ON GUARD
NOTHING HAPPENED THAT NIGHT WORSE THAN A BRIEF DRIZZLE OF RAIN AN HOUR BEFORE DAWN AS SOON AS IT WAS FULLY LIGHT THEY STARTED ALREADY THE FOG WAS THINNING THEY KEPT AS CLOSE AS THEY COULD TO THE WESTERN SIDE AND THEY COULD SEE THE DIM SHAPES OF THE LOW CLIFFS RISING EVER HIGHER SHADOWY WALLS WITH THEIR FEET IN THE HURRYING RIVER IN THE MIDMORNING THE CLOUDS DREW DOWN LOWER AND IT BEGAN TO RAIN HEAVILY THEY DREW THE SKINCOVERS OVER THEIR BOATS TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING FLOODED AND DRIFTED ON LITTLE COULD BE SEEN BEFORE THEM OR ABOUT THEM THROUGH THE GREY FALLING CURTAINS
THE RAIN HOWEVER DID NOT LAST LONG SLOWLY THE SKY ABOVE GREW LIGHTER AND THEN SUDDENLY THE CLOUDS BROKE AND THEIR DRAGGLED FRINGES TRAILED AWAY NORTHWARD UP THE RIVER THE FOGS AND MISTS WERE GONE BEFORE THE TRAVELLERS LAY A WIDE RAVINE WITH GREAT ROCKY SIDES TO WHICH CLUNG UPON SHELVES AND IN NARROW CREVICES A FEW THRAWN TREES THE CHANNEL GREW NARROWER AND THE RIVER SWIFTER NOW THEY WERE SPEEDING ALONG WITH LITTLE HOPE OF STOPPING OR TURNING WHATEVER THEY MIGHT MEET AHEAD OVER THEM WAS A LANE OF PALEBLUE SKY AROUND THEM THE DARK OVERSHADOWED RIVER AND BEFORE THEM BLACK SHUTTING OUT THE SUN THE HILLS OF EMYN MUIL IN WHICH NO OPENING COULD BE SEEN
FRODO PEERING FORWARD SAW IN THE DISTANCE TWO GREAT ROCKS APPROACHING LIKE GREAT PINNACLES OR PILLARS OF STONE THEY SEEMED TALL AND SHEER AND OMINOUS THEY STOOD UPON EITHER SIDE OF THE STREAM A NARROW GAP APPEARED BETWEEN THEM AND THE RIVER SWEPT THE BOATS TOWARDS IT
BEHOLD THE ARGONATH THE PILLARS OF THE KINGS CRIED ARAGORN WE SHALL PASS THEM SOON KEEP THE BOATS IN LINE AND AS FAR APART AS YOU CAN HOLD THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
AS FRODO WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE GREAT PILLARS ROSE LIKE TOWERS TO MEET HIM GIANTS THEY SEEMED TO HIM VAST GREY FIGURES SILENT BUT THREATENING THEN HE SAW THAT THEY WERE INDEED SHAPED AND FASHIONED THE CRAFT AND POWER OF OLD HAD WROUGHT UPON THEM AND STILL THEY PRESERVED THROUGH THE SUNS AND RAINS OF FORGOTTEN YEARS THE MIGHTY LIKENESSES IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN HEWN UPON GREAT PEDESTALS FOUNDED IN THE DEEP WATERS STOOD TWO GREAT KINGS OF STONE STILL WITH BLURRED EYES AND CRANNIED BROWS THEY FROWNED UPON THE NORTH THE LEFT HAND OF EACH WAS RAISED PALM OUTWARDS IN GESTURE OF WARNING IN EACH RIGHT HAND THERE WAS AN AXE UPON EACH HEAD THERE WAS A CRUMBLING HELM AND CROWN GREAT POWER AND MAJESTY THEY STILL WORE THE SILENT WARDENS OF A LONGVANISHED KINGDOM AWE AND FEAR FELL UPON FRODO AND HE COWERED DOWN SHUTTING HIS EYES AND NOT DARING TO LOOK UP AS THE BOAT DREW NEAR EVEN BOROMIR BOWED HIS HEAD AS THE BOATS WHIRLED BY FRAIL AND FLEETING AS LITTLE LEAVES UNDER THE ENDURING SHADOW OF THE SENTINELS OF NUMENOR SO THEY PASSED INTO THE DARK CHASM OF THE GATES
SHEER ROSE THE DREADFUL CLIFFS TO UNGUESSED HEIGHTS ON EITHER SIDE FAR OFF WAS THE DIM SKY THE BLACK WATERS ROARED AND ECHOED AND A WIND SCREAMED OVER THEM FRODO CROUCHING OVER HIS KNEES HEARD SAM IN FRONT MUTTERING AND GROANING WHAT A PLACE WHAT A HORRIBLE PLACE JUST LET ME GET OUT OF THIS BOAT AND ILL NEVER WET MY TOES IN A PUDDLE AGAIN LET ALONE A RIVER
FEAR NOT SAID A STRANGE VOICE BEHIND HIM FRODO TURNED AND SAW STRIDER AND YET NOT STRIDER FOR THE WEATHERWORN RANGER WAS NO LONGER THERE IN THE STERN SAT ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN PROUD AND ERECT GUIDING THE BOAT WITH SKILFUL STROKES HIS HOOD WAS CAST BACK AND HIS DARK HAIR WAS BLOWING IN THE WIND A LIGHT WAS IN HIS EYES A KING RETURNING FROM EXILE TO HIS OWN LAND
FEAR NOT HE SAID LONG HAVE I DESIRED TO LOOK UPON THE LIKENESSES OF ISILDUR AND ANARION MY SIRES OF OLD UNDER THEIR SHADOW ELESSAR THE ELFSTONE SON OF ARATHORN OF THE HOUSE OF VALANDIL ISILDURS SON HEIR OF ELENDIL HAS NOUGHT TO DREAD
THEN THE LIGHT OF HIS EYES FADED AND HE SPOKE TO HIMSELF WOULD THAT GANDALF WERE HERE HOW MY HEART YEARNS FOR MINAS ANOR AND THE WALLS OF MY OWN CITY BUT WHITHER NOW SHALL I GO
THE CHASM WAS LONG AND DARK AND FILLED WITH THE NOISE OF WIND AND RUSHING WATER AND ECHOING STONE IT BENT SOMEWHAT TOWARDS THE WEST SO THAT AT FIRST ALL WAS DARK AHEAD BUT SOON FRODO SAW A TALL GAP OF LIGHT BEFORE HIM EVER GROWING SWIFTLY IT DREW NEAR AND SUDDENLY THE BOATS SHOT THROUGH OUT INTO A WIDE CLEAR LIGHT
THE SUN ALREADY LONG FALLEN FROM THE NOON WAS SHINING IN A WINDY SKY THE PENT WATERS SPREAD OUT INTO A LONG OVAL LAKE PALE NEN HITHOEL FENCED BY STEEP GREY HILLS WHOSE SIDES WERE CLAD WITH TREES BUT THEIR HEADS WERE BARE COLDGLEAMING IN THE SUNLIGHT AT THE FAR SOUTHERN END ROSE THREE PEAKS THE MIDMOST STOOD SOMEWHAT FORWARD FROM THE OTHERS AND SUNDERED FROM THEM AN ISLAND IN THE WATERS ABOUT WHICH THE FLOWING RIVER FLUNG PALE SHIMMERING ARMS DISTANT BUT DEEP THERE CAME UP ON THE WIND A ROARING SOUND LIKE THE ROLL OF THUNDER HEARD FAR AWAY
BEHOLD TOL BRANDIR SAID ARAGORN POINTING SOUTH TO THE TALL PEAK UPON THE LEFT STANDS AMON LHAW AND UPON THE RIGHT IS AMON HEN THE HILLS OF HEARING AND OF SIGHT IN THE DAYS OF THE GREAT KINGS THERE WERE HIGH SEATS UPON THEM AND WATCH WAS KEPT THERE BUT IT IS SAID THAT NO FOOT OF MAN OR BEAST HAS EVER BEEN SET UPON TOL BRANDIR ERE THE SHADE OF NIGHT FALLS WE SHALL COME TO THEM I HEAR THE ENDLESS VOICE OF RAUROS CALLING
THE COMPANY RESTED NOW FOR A WHILE DRIFTING SOUTH ON THE CURRENT THAT FLOWED THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE THEY ATE SOME FOOD AND THEN THEY TOOK TO THEIR PADDLES AND HASTENED ON THEIR WAY THE SIDES OF THE WESTWARD HILLS FELL INTO SHADOW AND THE SUN GREW ROUND AND RED HERE AND THERE A MISTY STAR PEERED OUT THE THREE PEAKS LOOMED BEFORE THEM DARKLING IN THE TWILIGHT RAUROS WAS ROARING WITH A GREAT VOICE ALREADY NIGHT WAS LAID ON THE FLOWING WATERS WHEN THE TRAVELLERS CAME AT LAST UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HILLS
THE TENTH DAY OF THEIR JOURNEY WAS OVER WILDERLAND WAS BEHIND THEM THEY COULD GO NO FURTHER WITHOUT CHOICE BETWEEN THE EASTWAY AND THE WEST THE LAST STAGE OF THE QUEST WAS BEFORE THEM



CHAPTER 10
THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP

ARAGORN LED THEM TO THE RIGHT ARM OF THE RIVER HERE UPON ITS WESTERN SIDE UNDER THE SHADOW OF TOL BRANDIR A GREEN LAWN RAN DOWN TO THE WATER FROM THE FEET OF AMON HEN BEHIND IT ROSE THE FIRST GENTLE SLOPES OF THE HILL CLAD WITH TREES AND TREES MARCHED AWAY WESTWARD ALONG THE CURVING SHORES OF THE LAKE A LITTLE SPRING FELL TUMBLING DOWN AND FED THE GRASS
HERE WE WILL REST TONIGHT SAID ARAGORN THIS IS THE LAWN OF PARTH GALEN A FAIR PLACE IN THE SUMMER DAYS OF OLD LET US HOPE THAT NO EVIL HAS YET COME HERE
THEY DREW UP THEIR BOATS ON THE GREEN BANKS AND BESIDE THEM THEY MADE THEIR CAMP THEY SET A WATCH BUT HAD NO SIGHT NOR SOUND OF THEIR ENEMIES IF GOLLUM HAD CONTRIVED TO FOLLOW THEM HE REMAINED UNSEEN AND UNHEARD NONETHELESS AS THE NIGHT WORE ON ARAGORN GREW UNEASY TOSSING OFTEN IN HIS SLEEP AND WAKING IN THE SMALL HOURS HE GOT UP AND CAME TO FRODO WHOSE TURN IT WAS TO WATCH
WHY ARE YOU WAKING ASKED FRODO IT IS NOT YOUR WATCH
I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED ARAGORN BUT A SHADOW AND A THREAT HAS BEEN GROWING IN MY SLEEP IT WOULD BE WELL TO DRAW YOUR SWORD
WHY SAID FRODO ARE ENEMIES AT HAND
LET US SEE WHAT STING MAY SHOW ANSWERED ARAGORN
FRODO THEN DREW THE ELFBLADE FROM ITS SHEATH TO HIS DISMAY THE EDGES GLEAMED DIMLY IN THE NIGHT ORCS HE SAID NOT VERY NEAR AND YET TOO NEAR IT SEEMS
I FEARED AS MUCH SAID ARAGORN BUT MAYBE THEY ARE NOT ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THE LIGHT OF STING IS FAINT AND IT MAY POINT TO NO MORE THAN SPIES OF MORDOR ROAMING ON THE SLOPES OF AMON LHAW I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE OF ORCS UPON AMON HEN YET WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THESE EVIL DAYS NOW THAT MINAS TIRITH NO LONGER HOLDS SECURE THE PASSAGES OF ANDUIN WE MUST GO WARILY TOMORROW
THE DAY CAME LIKE FIRE AND SMOKE LOW IN THE EAST THERE WERE BLACK BARS OF CLOUD LIKE THE FUMES OF A GREAT BURNING THE RISING SUN LIT THEM FROM BENEATH WITH FLAMES OF MURKY RED BUT SOON IT CLIMBED ABOVE THEM INTO A CLEAR SKY THE SUMMIT OF TOL BRANDIR WAS TIPPED WITH GOLD FRODO LOOKED OUT EASTWARD AND GAZED AT THE TALL ISLAND ITS SIDES SPRANG SHEER OUT OF THE RUNNING WATER HIGH UP ABOVE THE TALL CLIFFS WERE STEEP SLOPES UPON WHICH TREES CLIMBED MOUNTING ONE HEAD ABOVE ANOTHER AND ABOVE THEM AGAIN WERE GREY FACES OF INACCESSIBLE ROCK CROWNED BY A GREAT SPIRE OF STONE MANY BIRDS WERE CIRCLING ABOUT IT BUT NO SIGN OF OTHER LIVING THINGS COULD BE SEEN
WHEN THEY HAD EATEN ARAGORN CALLED THE COMPANY TOGETHER THE DAY HAS COME AT LAST HE SAID THE DAY OF CHOICE WHICH WE HAVE LONG DELAYED WHAT SHALL NOW BECOME OF OUR COMPANY THAT HAS TRAVELLED SO FAR IN FELLOWSHIP SHALL WE TURN WEST WITH BOROMIR AND GO TO THE WARS OF GONDOR OR TURN EAST TO THE FEAR AND SHADOW OR SHALL WE BREAK OUR FELLOWSHIP AND GO THIS WAY AND THAT AS EACH MAY CHOOSE WHATEVER WE DO MUST BE DONE SOON WE CANNOT LONG HALT HERE THE ENEMY IS ON THE EASTERN SHORE WE KNOW BUT I FEAR THAT THE ORCS MAY ALREADY BE ON THIS SIDE OF THE WATER
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE IN WHICH NO ONE SPOKE OR MOVED
WELL FRODO SAID ARAGORN AT LAST I FEAR THAT THE BURDEN IS LAID UPON YOU YOU ARE THE BEARER APPOINTED BY THE COUNCIL YOUR OWN WAY YOU ALONE CAN CHOOSE IN THIS MATTER I CANNOT ADVISE YOU I AM NOT GANDALF AND THOUGH I HAVE TRIED TO BEAR HIS PART I DO NOT KNOW WHAT DESIGN OR HOPE HE HAD FOR THIS HOUR IF INDEED HE HAD ANY MOST LIKELY IT SEEMS THAT IF HE WERE HERE NOW THE CHOICE WOULD STILL WAIT ON YOU SUCH IS YOUR FATE
FRODO DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE THEN HE SPOKE SLOWLY I KNOW THAT HASTE IS NEEDED YET I CANNOT CHOOSE THE BURDEN IS HEAVY GIVE ME AN HOUR LONGER AND I WILL SPEAK LET ME BE ALONE
ARAGORN LOOKED AT HIM WITH KINDLY PITY VERY WELL FRODO SON OF DROGO HE SAID YOU SHALL HAVE AN HOUR AND YOU SHALL BE ALONE WE WILL STAY HERE FOR A WHILE BUT DO NOT STRAY FAR OR OUT OF CALL
FRODO SAT FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS HEAD BOWED SAM WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HIS MASTER WITH GREAT CONCERN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MUTTERED PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF IT IS BUT ITS NO GOOD SAM GAMGEE PUTTING IN HIS SPOKE JUST NOW
PRESENTLY FRODO GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY AND SAM SAW THAT WHILE THE OTHERS RESTRAINED THEMSELVES AND DID NOT STARE AT HIM THE EYES OF BOROMIR FOLLOWED FRODO INTENTLY UNTIL HE PASSED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE TREES AT THE FOOT OF AMON HEN
WANDERING AIMLESSLY AT FIRST IN THE WOOD FRODO FOUND THAT HIS FEET WERE LEADING HIM UP TOWARDS THE SLOPES OF THE HILL HE CAME TO A PATH THE DWINDLING RUINS OF A ROAD OF LONG AGO IN STEEP PLACES STAIRS OF STONE HAD BEEN HEWN BUT NOW THEY WERE CRACKED AND WORN AND SPLIT BY THE ROOTS OF TREES FOR SOME WHILE HE CLIMBED NOT CARING WHICH WAY HE WENT UNTIL HE CAME TO A GRASSY PLACE ROWANTREES GREW ABOUT IT AND IN THE MIDST WAS A WIDE FLAT STONE THE LITTLE UPLAND LAWN WAS OPEN UPON THE EAST AND WAS FILLED NOW WITH THE EARLY SUNLIGHT FRODO HALTED AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE RIVER FAR BELOW HIM TO TOL BRANDIR AND THE BIRDS WHEELING IN THE GREAT GULF OF AIR BETWEEN HIM AND THE UNTRODDEN ISLE THE VOICE OF RAUROS WAS A MIGHTY ROARING MINGLED WITH A DEEP THROBBING BOOM

HE SAT DOWN UPON THE STONE AND CUPPED HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS STARING EASTWARDS BUT SEEING LITTLE WITH HIS EYES ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE BILBO LEFT THE SHIRE WAS PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND AND HE RECALLED AND PONDERED EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD REMEMBER OF GANDALFS WORDS TIME WENT ON AND STILL HE WAS NO NEARER TO A CHOICE
SUDDENLY HE AWOKE FROM HIS THOUGHTS A STRANGE FEELING CAME TO HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS BEHIND HIM THAT UNFRIENDLY EYES WERE UPON HIM HE SPRANG UP AND TURNED BUT ALL THAT HE SAW TO HIS SURPRISE WAS BOROMIR AND HIS FACE WAS SMILING AND KIND
I WAS AFRAID FOR YOU FRODO HE SAID COMING FORWARD IF ARAGORN IS RIGHT AND ORCS ARE NEAR THEN NONE OF US SHOULD WANDER ALONE AND YOU LEAST OF ALL SO MUCH DEPENDS ON YOU AND MY HEART TOO IS HEAVY MAY I STAY NOW AND TALK FOR A WHILE SINCE I HAVE FOUND YOU IT WOULD COMFORT ME WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY ALL SPEECH BECOMES A DEBATE WITHOUT END BUT TWO TOGETHER MAY PERHAPS FIND WISDOM
YOU ARE KIND ANSWERED FRODO BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT ANY SPEECH WILL HELP ME FOR I KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO BUT I AM AFRAID OF DOING IT BOROMIR AFRAID
BOROMIR STOOD SILENT RAUROS ROARED ENDLESSLY ON THE WIND MURMURED IN THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES FRODO SHIVERED
SUDDENLY BOROMIR CAME AND SAT BESIDE HIM ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU DO NOT SUFFER NEEDLESSLY HE SAID I WISH TO HELP YOU YOU NEED COUNSEL IN YOUR HARD CHOICE WILL YOU NOT TAKE MINE
I THINK I KNOW ALREADY WHAT COUNSEL YOU WOULD GIVE BOROMIR SAID FRODO AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE WISDOM BUT FOR THE WARNING OF MY HEART
WARNING WARNING AGAINST WHAT SAID BOROMIR SHARPLY
AGAINST DELAY AGAINST THE WAY THAT SEEMS EASIER AGAINST REFUSAL OF THE BURDEN THAT IS LAID ON ME AGAINST  WELL IF IT MUST BE SAID AGAINST TRUST IN THE STRENGTH AND TRUTH OF MEN
YET THAT STRENGTH HAS LONG PROTECTED YOU FAR AWAY IN YOUR LITTLE COUNTRY THOUGH YOU KNEW IT NOT
I DO NOT DOUBT THE VALOUR OF YOUR PEOPLE BUT THE WORLD IS CHANGING THE WALLS OF MINAS TIRITH MAY BE STRONG BUT THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH IF THEY FAIL WHAT THEN
WE SHALL FALL IN BATTLE VALIANTLY YET THERE IS STILL HOPE THAT THEY WILL NOT FAIL
NO HOPE WHILE THE RING LASTS SAID FRODO
AH THE RING SAID BOROMIR HIS EYES LIGHTING THE RING IS IT NOT A STRANGE FATE THAT WE SHOULD SUFFER SO MUCH FEAR AND DOUBT FOR SO SMALL A THING SO SMALL A THING AND I HAVE SEEN IT ONLY FOR AN INSTANT IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND COULD I NOT HAVE A SIGHT OF IT AGAIN
FRODO LOOKED UP HIS HEART WENT SUDDENLY COLD HE CAUGHT THE STRANGE GLEAM IN BOROMIRS EYES YET HIS FACE WAS STILL KIND AND FRIENDLY IT IS BEST THAT IT SHOULD LIE HIDDEN HE ANSWERED
AS YOU WISH I CARE NOT SAID BOROMIR YET MAY I NOT EVEN SPEAK OF IT FOR YOU SEEM EVER TO THINK ONLY OF ITS POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY OF ITS EVIL USES NOT OF ITS GOOD THE WORLD IS CHANGING YOU SAY MINAS TIRITH WILL FALL IF THE RING LASTS BUT WHY CERTAINLY IF THE RING WERE WITH THE ENEMY BUT WHY IF IT WERE WITH US
WERE YOU NOT AT THE COUNCIL ANSWERED FRODO BECAUSE WE CANNOT USE IT AND WHAT IS DONE WITH IT TURNS TO EVIL
BOROMIR GOT UP AND WALKED ABOUT IMPATIENTLY SO YOU GO ON HE CRIED GANDALF ELROND  ALL THESE FOLK HAVE TAUGHT YOU TO SAY SO FOR THEMSELVES THEY MAY BE RIGHT THESE ELVES AND HALFELVES AND WIZARDS THEY WOULD COME TO GRIEF PERHAPS YET OFTEN I DOUBT IF THEY ARE WISE AND NOT MERELY TIMID BUT EACH TO HIS OWN KIND TRUEHEARTED MEN THEY WILL NOT BE CORRUPTED WE OF MINAS TIRITH HAVE BEEN STAUNCH THROUGH LONG YEARS OF TRIAL WE DO NOT DESIRE THE POWER OF WIZARDLORDS ONLY STRENGTH TO DEFEND OURSELVES STRENGTH IN A JUST CAUSE AND BEHOLD IN OUR NEED CHANCE BRINGS TO LIGHT THE RING OF POWER IT IS A GIFT I SAY A GIFT TO THE FOES OF MORDOR IT IS MAD NOT TO USE IT TO USE THE POWER OF THE ENEMY AGAINST HIM THE FEARLESS THE RUTHLESS THESE ALONE WILL ACHIEVE VICTORY WHAT COULD NOT A WARRIOR DO IN THIS HOUR A GREAT LEADER WHAT COULD NOT ARAGORN DO OR IF HE REFUSES WHY NOT BOROMIR THE RING WOULD GIVE ME POWER OF COMMAND HOW I WOULD DRIVE THE HOSTS OF MORDOR AND ALL MEN WOULD FLOCK TO MY BANNER
BOROMIR STRODE UP AND DOWN SPEAKING EVER MORE LOUDLY ALMOST HE SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN FRODO WHILE HIS TALK DWELT ON WALLS AND WEAPONS AND THE MUSTERING OF MEN AND HE DREW PLANS FOR GREAT ALLIANCES AND GLORIOUS VICTORIES TO BE AND HE CAST DOWN MORDOR AND BECAME HIMSELF A MIGHTY KING BENEVOLENT AND WISE SUDDENLY HE STOPPED AND WAVED HIS ARMS
AND THEY TELL US TO THROW IT AWAY HE CRIED I DO NOT SAY DESTROY IT THAT MIGHT BE WELL IF REASON COULD SHOW ANY HOPE OF DOING SO IT DOES NOT THE ONLY PLAN THAT IS PROPOSED TO US IS THAT A HALFLING SHOULD WALK BLINDLY INTO MORDOR AND OFFER THE ENEMY EVERY CHANCE OF RECAPTURING IT FOR HIMSELF FOLLY
SURELY YOU SEE IT MY FRIEND HE SAID TURNING NOW SUDDENLY TO FRODO AGAIN YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE AFRAID IF IT IS SO THE BOLDEST SHOULD PARDON YOU BUT IS IT NOT REALLY YOUR GOOD SENSE THAT REVOLTS
NO I AM AFRAID SAID FRODO SIMPLY AFRAID BUT I AM GLAD TO HAVE HEARD YOU SPEAK SO FULLY MY MIND IS CLEARER NOW
THEN YOU WILL COME TO MINAS TIRITH CRIED BOROMIR HIS EYES WERE SHINING AND HIS FACE EAGER
YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID FRODO
BUT YOU WILL COME AT LEAST FOR A WHILE BOROMIR PERSISTED MY CITY IS NOT FAR NOW AND IT IS LITTLE FURTHER FROM THERE TO MORDOR THAN FROM HERE WE HAVE BEEN LONG IN THE WILDERNESS AND YOU NEED NEWS OF WHAT THE ENEMY IS DOING BEFORE YOU MAKE A MOVE COME WITH ME FRODO HE SAID YOU NEED REST BEFORE YOUR VENTURE IF GO YOU MUST HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE HOBBITS SHOULDER IN FRIENDLY FASHION BUT FRODO FELT THE HAND TREMBLING WITH SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT HE STEPPED QUICKLY AWAY AND EYED WITH ALARM THE TALL MAN NEARLY TWICE HIS HEIGHT AND MANY TIMES HIS MATCH IN STRENGTH
WHY ARE YOU SO UNFRIENDLY SAID BOROMIR I AM A TRUE MAN NEITHER THIEF NOR TRACKER I NEED YOUR RING THAT YOU KNOW NOW BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT I DO NOT DESIRE TO KEEP IT WILL YOU NOT AT LEAST LET ME MAKE TRIAL OF MY PLAN LEND ME THE RING
NO NO CRIED FRODO THE COUNCIL LAID IT UPON ME TO BEAR IT
IT IS BY OUR OWN FOLLY THAT THE ENEMY WILL DEFEAT US CRIED BOROMIR HOW IT ANGERS ME FOOL OBSTINATE FOOL RUNNING WILFULLY TO DEATH AND RUINING OUR CAUSE IF ANY MORTALS HAVE CLAIM TO THE RING IT IS THE MEN OF NUMENOR AND NOT HALFLINGS IT IS NOT YOURS SAVE BY UNHAPPY CHANCE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MINE IT SHOULD BE MINE GIVE IT TO ME
FRODO DID NOT ANSWER BUT MOVED AWAY TILL THE GREAT FLAT STONE STOOD BETWEEN THEM COME COME MY FRIEND SAID BOROMIR IN A SOFTER VOICE WHY NOT GET RID OF IT WHY NOT BE FREE OF YOUR DOUBT AND FEAR YOU CAN LAY THE BLAME ON ME IF YOU WILL YOU CAN SAY THAT I WAS TOO STRONG AND TOOK IT BY FORCE FOR I AM TOO STRONG FOR YOU HALFLING HE CRIED AND SUDDENLY HE SPRANG OVER THE STONE AND LEAPED AT FRODO HIS FAIR AND PLEASANT FACE WAS HIDEOUSLY CHANGED A RAGING FIRE WAS IN HIS EYES
FRODO DODGED ASIDE AND AGAIN PUT THE STONE BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING HE COULD DO TREMBLING HE PULLED OUT THE RING UPON ITS CHAIN AND QUICKLY SLIPPED IT ON HIS FINGER EVEN AS BOROMIR SPRANG AT HIM AGAIN THE MAN GASPED STARED FOR A MOMENT AMAZED AND THEN RAN WILDLY ABOUT SEEKING HERE AND THERE AMONG THE ROCKS AND TREES
MISERABLE TRICKSTER HE SHOUTED LET ME GET MY HANDS ON YOU NOW I SEE YOUR MIND YOU WILL TAKE THE RING TO SAURON AND SELL US ALL YOU HAVE ONLY WAITED YOUR CHANCE TO LEAVE US IN THE LURCH CURSE YOU AND ALL HALFLINGS TO DEATH AND DARKNESS THEN CATCHING HIS FOOT ON A STONE HE FELL SPRAWLING AND LAY UPON HIS FACE FOR A WHILE HE WAS AS STILL AS IF HIS OWN CURSE HAD STRUCK HIM DOWN THEN SUDDENLY HE WEPT
HE ROSE AND PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES DASHING AWAY THE TEARS WHAT HAVE I SAID HE CRIED WHAT HAVE I DONE FRODO FRODO HE CALLED COME BACK A MADNESS TOOK ME BUT IT HAS PASSED COME BACK
THERE WAS NO ANSWER FRODO DID NOT EVEN HEAR HIS CRIES HE WAS ALREADY FAR AWAY LEAPING BLINDLY UP THE PATH TO THE HILLTOP TERROR AND GRIEF SHOOK HIM SEEING IN HIS THOUGHT THE MAD FIERCE FACE OF BOROMIR AND HIS BURNING EYES
SOON HE CAME OUT ALONE ON THE SUMMIT OF AMON HEN AND HALTED GASPING FOR BREATH HE SAW AS THROUGH A MIST A WIDE FLAT CIRCLE PAVED WITH MIGHTY FLAGS AND SURROUNDED WITH A CRUMBLING BATTLEMENT AND IN THE MIDDLE SET UPON FOUR CARVEN PILLARS WAS A HIGH SEAT REACHED BY A STAIR OF MANY STEPS UP HE WENT AND SAT UPON THE ANCIENT CHAIR FEELING LIKE A LOST CHILD THAT HAD CLAMBERED UPON THE THRONE OF MOUNTAINKINGS
AT FIRST HE COULD SEE LITTLE HE SEEMED TO BE IN A WORLD OF MIST IN WHICH THERE WERE ONLY SHADOWS THE RING WAS UPON HIM THEN HERE AND THERE THE MIST GAVE WAY AND HE SAW MANY VISIONS SMALL AND CLEAR AS IF THEY WERE UNDER HIS EYES UPON A TABLE AND YET REMOTE THERE WAS NO SOUND ONLY BRIGHT LIVING IMAGES THE WORLD SEEMED TO HAVE SHRUNK AND FALLEN SILENT HE WAS SITTING UPON THE SEAT OF SEEING ON AMON HEN THE HILL OF THE EYE OF THE MEN OF NUMENOR EASTWARD HE LOOKED INTO WIDE UNCHARTED LANDS NAMELESS PLAINS AND FORESTS UNEXPLORED NORTHWARD HE LOOKED AND THE GREAT RIVER LAY LIKE A RIBBON BENEATH HIM AND THE MISTY MOUNTAINS STOOD SMALL AND HARD AS BROKEN TEETH WESTWARD HE LOOKED AND SAW THE BROAD PASTURES OF ROHAN AND ORTHANC THE PINNACLE OF ISENGARD LIKE A BLACK SPIKE SOUTHWARD HE LOOKED AND BELOW HIS VERY FEET THE GREAT RIVER CURLED LIKE A TOPPLING WAVE AND PLUNGED OVER THE FALLS OF RAUROS INTO A FOAMING PIT A GLIMMERING RAINBOW PLAYED UPON THE FUME AND ETHIR ANDUIN HE SAW THE MIGHTY DELTA OF THE RIVER AND MYRIADS OF SEABIRDS WHIRLING LIKE A WHITE DUST IN THE SUN AND BENEATH THEM A GREEN AND SILVER SEA RIPPLING IN ENDLESS LINES
BUT EVERYWHERE HE LOOKED HE SAW THE SIGNS OF WAR THE MISTY MOUNTAINS WERE CRAWLING LIKE ANTHILLS ORCS WERE ISSUING OUT OF A THOUSAND HOLES UNDER THE BOUGHS OF MIRKWOOD THERE WAS DEADLY STRIFE OF ELVES AND MEN AND FELL BEASTS THE LAND OF THE BEORNINGS WAS AFLAME A CLOUD WAS OVER MORIA SMOKE ROSE ON THE BORDERS OF LORIEN
HORSEMEN WERE GALLOPING ON THE GRASS OF ROHAN WOLVES POURED FROM ISENGARD FROM THE HAVENS OF HARAD SHIPS OF WAR PUT OUT TO SEA AND OUT OF THE EAST MEN WERE MOVING ENDLESSLY SWORDSMEN SPEARMEN BOWMEN UPON HORSES CHARIOTS OF CHIEFTAINS AND LADEN WAINS ALL THE POWER OF THE DARK LORD WAS IN MOTION THEN TURNING SOUTH AGAIN HE BEHELD MINAS TIRITH FAR AWAY IT SEEMED AND BEAUTIFUL WHITEWALLED MANYTOWERED PROUD AND FAIR UPON ITS MOUNTAINSEAT ITS BATTLEMENTS GLITTERED WITH STEEL AND ITS TURRETS WERE BRIGHT WITH MANY BANNERS HOPE LEAPED IN HIS HEART BUT AGAINST MINAS TIRITH WAS SET ANOTHER FORTRESS GREATER AND MORE STRONG THITHER EASTWARD UNWILLING HIS EYE WAS DRAWN IT PASSED THE RUINED BRIDGES OF OSGILIATH THE GRINNING GATES OF MINAS MORGUL AND THE HAUNTED MOUNTAINS AND IT LOOKED UPON GORGOROTH THE VALLEY OF TERROR IN THE LAND OF MORDOR DARKNESS LAY THERE UNDER THE SUN FIRE GLOWED AMID THE SMOKE MOUNT DOOM WAS BURNING AND A GREAT REEK RISING THEN AT LAST HIS GAZE WAS HELD WALL UPON WALL BATTLEMENT UPON BATTLEMENT BLACK IMMEASURABLY STRONG MOUNTAIN OF IRON GATE OF STEEL TOWER OF ADAMANT HE SAW IT BARADDUR FORTRESS OF SAURON ALL HOPE LEFT HIM
AND SUDDENLY HE FELT THE EYE THERE WAS AN EYE IN THE DARK TOWER THAT DID NOT SLEEP HE KNEW THAT IT HAD BECOME AWARE OF HIS GAZE A FIERCE EAGER WILL WAS THERE IT LEAPED TOWARDS HIM ALMOST LIKE A FINGER HE FELT IT SEARCHING FOR HIM VERY SOON IT WOULD NAIL HIM DOWN KNOW JUST EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS AMON LHAW IT TOUCHED IT GLANCED UPON TOL BRANDIR HE THREW HIMSELF FROM THE SEAT CROUCHING COVERING HIS HEAD WITH HIS GREY HOOD
HE HEARD HIMSELF CRYING OUT NEVER NEVER OR WAS IT VERILY I COME I COME TO YOU HE COULD NOT TELL THEN AS A FLASH FROM SOME OTHER POINT OF POWER THERE CAME TO HIS MIND ANOTHER THOUGHT TAKE IT OFF TAKE IT OFF FOOL TAKE IT OFF TAKE OFF THE RING
THE TWO POWERS STROVE IN HIM FOR A MOMENT PERFECTLY BALANCED BETWEEN THEIR PIERCING POINTS HE WRITHED TORMENTED SUDDENLY HE WAS AWARE OF HIMSELF AGAIN FRODO NEITHER THE VOICE NOR THE EYE FREE TO CHOOSE AND WITH ONE REMAINING INSTANT IN WHICH TO DO SO HE TOOK THE RING OFF HIS FINGER HE WAS KNEELING IN CLEAR SUNLIGHT BEFORE THE HIGH SEAT A BLACK SHADOW SEEMED TO PASS LIKE AN ARM ABOVE HIM IT MISSED AMON HEN AND GROPED OUT WEST AND FADED THEN ALL THE SKY WAS CLEAN AND BLUE AND BIRDS SANG IN EVERY TREE
FRODO ROSE TO HIS FEET A GREAT WEARINESS WAS ON HIM BUT HIS WILL WAS FIRM AND HIS HEART LIGHTER HE SPOKE ALOUD TO HIMSELF I WILL DO NOW WHAT I MUST HE SAID THIS AT LEAST IS PLAIN THE EVIL OF THE RING IS ALREADY AT WORK EVEN IN THE COMPANY AND THE RING MUST LEAVE THEM BEFORE IT DOES MORE HARM I WILL GO ALONE SOME I CANNOT TRUST AND THOSE I CAN TRUST ARE TOO DEAR TO ME POOR OLD SAM AND MERRY AND PIPPIN STRIDER TOO HIS HEART YEARNS FOR MINAS TIRITH AND HE WILL BE NEEDED THERE NOW BOROMIR HAS FALLEN INTO EVIL I WILL GO ALONE AT ONCE
HE WENT QUICKLY DOWN THE PATH AND CAME BACK TO THE LAWN WHERE BOROMIR HAD FOUND HIM THEN HE HALTED LISTENING HE THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR CRIES AND CALLS FROM THE WOODS NEAR THE SHORE BELOW
THEYLL BE HUNTING FOR ME HE SAID I WONDER HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN AWAY HOURS I SHOULD THINK HE HESITATED WHAT CAN I DO HE MUTTERED I MUST GO NOW OR I SHALL NEVER GO I SHANT GET A CHANCE AGAIN I HATE LEAVING THEM AND LIKE THIS WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION BUT SURELY THEY WILL UNDERSTAND SAM WILL AND WHAT ELSE CAN I DO
SLOWLY HE DREW OUT THE RING AND PUT IT ON ONCE MORE HE VANISHED AND PASSED DOWN THE HILL LESS THAN A RUSTLE OF THE WIND
THE OTHERS REMAINED LONG BY THE RIVERSIDE FOR SOME TIME THEY HAD BEEN SILENT MOVING RESTLESSLY ABOUT BUT NOW THEY WERE SITTING IN A CIRCLE AND THEY WERE TALKING EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THEY MADE EFFORTS TO SPEAK OF OTHER THINGS OF THEIR LONG ROAD AND MANY ADVENTURES THEY QUESTIONED ARAGORN CONCERNING THE REALM OF GONDOR AND ITS ANCIENT HISTORY AND THE REMNANTS OF ITS GREAT WORKS THAT COULD STILL BE SEEN IN THIS STRANGE BORDERLAND OF THE EMYN MUIL THE STONE KINGS AND THE SEATS OF LHAW AND HEN AND THE GREAT STAIR BESIDE THE FALLS OF RAUROS BUT ALWAYS THEIR THOUGHTS AND WORDS STRAYED BACK TO FRODO AND THE RING WHAT WOULD FRODO CHOOSE TO DO WHY WAS HE HESITATING
HE IS DEBATING WHICH COURSE IS THE MOST DESPERATE I THINK SAID ARAGORN AND WELL HE MAY IT IS NOW MORE HOPELESS THAN EVER FOR THE COMPANY TO GO EAST SINCE WE HAVE BEEN TRACKED BY GOLLUM AND MUST FEAR THAT THE SECRET OF OUR JOURNEY IS ALREADY BETRAYED BUT MINAS TIRITH IS NO NEARER TO THE FIRE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BURDEN
WE MAY REMAIN THERE FOR A WHILE AND MAKE A BRAVE STAND BUT THE LORD DENETHOR AND ALL HIS MEN CANNOT HOPE TO DO WHAT EVEN ELROND SAID WAS BEYOND HIS POWER EITHER TO KEEP THE BURDEN SECRET OR TO HOLD OFF THE FULL MIGHT OF THE ENEMY WHEN HE COMES TO TAKE IT WHICH WAY WOULD ANY OF US CHOOSE IN FRODOS PLACE I DO NOT KNOW NOW INDEED WE MISS GANDALF MOST
GRIEVOUS IS OUR LOSS SAID LEGOLAS YET WE MUST NEEDS MAKE UP OUR MINDS WITHOUT HIS AID WHY CANNOT WE DECIDE AND SO HELP FRODO LET US CALL HIM BACK AND THEN VOTE I SHOULD VOTE FOR MINAS TIRITH
AND SO SHOULD I SAID GIMLI WE OF COURSE WERE ONLY SENT TO HELP THE BEARER ALONG THE ROAD TO GO NO FURTHER THAN WE WISHED AND NONE OF US IS UNDER ANY OATH OR COMMAND TO SEEK MOUNT DOOM HARD WAS MY PARTING FROM LOTHLORIEN YET I HAVE COME SO FAR AND I SAY THIS NOW WE HAVE REACHED THE LAST CHOICE IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT I CANNOT LEAVE FRODO I WOULD CHOOSE MINAS TIRITH BUT IF HE DOES NOT THEN I FOLLOW HIM
AND I TOO WILL GO WITH HIM SAID LEGOLAS IT WOULD BE FAITHLESS NOW TO SAY FAREWELL
IT WOULD INDEED BE A BETRAYAL IF WE ALL LEFT HIM SAID ARAGORN BUT IF HE GOES EAST THEN ALL NEED NOT GO WITH HIM NOR DO I THINK THAT ALL SHOULD THAT VENTURE IS DESPERATE AS MUCH SO FOR EIGHT AS FOR THREE OR TWO OR ONE ALONE IF YOU WOULD LET ME CHOOSE THEN I SHOULD APPOINT THREE COMPANIONS SAM WHO COULD NOT BEAR IT OTHERWISE AND GIMLI AND MYSELF BOROMIR WILL RETURN TO HIS OWN CITY WHERE HIS FATHER AND HIS PEOPLE NEED HIM AND WITH HIM THE OTHERS SHOULD GO OR AT LEAST MERIADOC AND PEREGRIN IF LEGOLAS IS NOT WILLING TO LEAVE US
THAT WONT DO AT ALL CRIED MERRY WE CANT LEAVE FRODO PIPPIN AND I ALWAYS INTENDED TO GO WHEREVER HE WENT AND WE STILL DO BUT WE DID NOT REALIZE WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IT SEEMED DIFFERENT SO FAR AWAY IN THE SHIRE OR IN RIVENDELL IT WOULD BE MAD AND CRUEL TO LET FRODO GO TO MORDOR WHY CANT WE STOP HIM
WE MUST STOP HIM SAID PIPPIN AND THAT IS WHAT HE IS WORRYING ABOUT I AM SURE HE KNOWS WE SHANT AGREE TO HIS GOING EAST AND HE DOESNT LIKE TO ASK ANYONE TO GO WITH HIM POOR OLD FELLOW IMAGINE IT GOING OFF TO MORDOR ALONE PIPPIN SHUDDERED BUT THE DEAR SILLY OLD HOBBIT HE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT HE HASNT GOT TO ASK HE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT IF WE CANT STOP HIM WE SHANT LEAVE HIM

I BELIEVE YOU SPEAK MORE WISELY THAN ANY OF US SAM SAID ARAGORN AND WHAT SHALL WE DO IF YOU PROVE RIGHT
STOP HIM DONT LET HIM GO CRIED PIPPIN
I WONDER SAID ARAGORN HE IS THE BEARER AND THE FATE OF THE BURDEN IS ON HIM I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS OUR PART TO DRIVE HIM ONE WAY OR THE OTHER NOR DO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD SUCCEED IF WE TRIED THERE ARE OTHER POWERS AT WORK FAR STRONGER
WELL I WISH FRODO WOULD SCREW HIMSELF UP AND COME BACK AND LET US GET IT OVER SAID PIPPIN THIS WAITING IS HORRIBLE SURELY THE TIME IS UP
YES SAID ARAGORN THE HOUR IS LONG PASSED THE MORNING IS WEARING AWAY WE MUST CALL FOR HIM
AT THAT MOMENT BOROMIR REAPPEARED HE CAME OUT FROM THE TREES AND WALKED TOWARDS THEM WITHOUT SPEAKING HIS FACE LOOKED GRIM AND SAD HE PAUSED AS IF COUNTING THOSE THAT WERE PRESENT AND THEN SAT DOWN ALOOF WITH HIS EYES ON THE GROUND
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN BOROMIR ASKED ARAGORN HAVE YOU SEEN FRODO
BOROMIR HESITATED FOR A SECOND YES AND NO HE ANSWERED SLOWLY YES I FOUND HIM SOME WAY UP THE HILL AND I SPOKE TO HIM I URGED HIM TO COME TO MINAS TIRITH AND NOT TO GO EAST I GREW ANGRY AND HE LEFT ME HE VANISHED I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A THING HAPPEN BEFORE THOUGH I HAVE HEARD OF IT IN TALES HE MUST HAVE PUT THE RING ON I COULD NOT FIND HIM AGAIN I THOUGHT HE WOULD RETURN TO YOU
IS THAT ALL THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAID ARAGORN LOOKING HARD AND NOT TOO KINDLY AT BOROMIR
YES HE ANSWERED I WILL SAY NO MORE YET
THIS IS BAD CRIED SAM JUMPING UP I DONT KNOW WHAT THIS MAN HAS BEEN UP TO WHY SHOULD MR FRODO PUT THE THING ON HE DIDNT OUGHT TO HAVE AND IF HE HAS GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED
BUT HE WOULDNT KEEP IT ON SAID MERRY NOT WHEN HE HAD ESCAPED THE UNWELCOME VISITOR LIKE BILBO USED TO
BUT WHERE DID HE GO WHERE IS HE CRIED PIPPIN HES BEEN AWAY AGES NOW
HOW LONG IS IT SINCE YOU SAW FRODO LAST BOROMIR ASKED ARAGORN
HALF AN HOUR MAYBE HE ANSWERED OR IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR I HAVE WANDERED FOR SOME TIME SINCE I DO NOT KNOW I DO NOT KNOW HE PUT HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SAT AS IF BOWED WITH GRIEF
AN HOUR SINCE HE VANISHED SHOUTED SAM WE MUST TRY AND FIND HIM AT ONCE COME ON
WAIT A MOMENT CRIED ARAGORN WE MUST DIVIDE UP INTO PAIRS AND ARRANGE  HERE HOLD ON WAIT
IT WAS NO GOOD THEY TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIM SAM HAD DASHED OFF FIRST MERRY AND PIPPIN HAD FOLLOWED AND WERE ALREADY DISAPPEARING WESTWARD INTO THE TREES BY THE SHORE SHOUTING FRODO FRODO IN THEIR CLEAR HIGH HOBBITVOICES LEGOLAS AND GIMLI WERE RUNNING A SUDDEN PANIC OR MADNESS SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE COMPANY
WE SHALL ALL BE SCATTERED AND LOST GROANED ARAGORN BOROMIR I DO NOT KNOW WHAT PART YOU HAVE PLAYED IN THIS MISCHIEF BUT HELP NOW GO AFTER THOSE TWO YOUNG HOBBITS AND GUARD THEM AT THE LEAST EVEN IF YOU CANNOT FIND FRODO COME BACK TO THIS SPOT IF YOU FIND HIM OR ANY TRACES OF HIM I SHALL RETURN SOON
ARAGORN SPRANG SWIFTLY AWAY AND WENT IN PURSUIT OF SAM JUST AS HE REACHED THE LITTLE LAWN AMONG THE ROWANS HE OVERTOOK HIM TOILING UPHILL PANTING AND CALLING FRODO
COME WITH ME SAM HE SAID NONE OF US SHOULD BE ALONE THERE IS MISCHIEF ABOUT I FEEL IT I AM GOING TO THE TOP TO THE SEAT OF AMON HEN TO SEE WHAT MAY BE SEEN AND LOOK IT IS AS MY HEART GUESSED FRODO WENT THIS WAY FOLLOW ME AND KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN HE SPED UP THE PATH
SAM DID HIS BEST BUT HE COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH STRIDER THE RANGER AND SOON FELL BEHIND HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE ARAGORN WAS OUT OF SIGHT AHEAD SAM STOPPED AND PUFFED SUDDENLY HE CLAPPED HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD
WHOA SAM GAMGEE HE SAID ALOUD YOUR LEGS ARE TOO SHORT SO USE YOUR HEAD LET ME SEE NOW BOROMIR ISNT LYING THATS NOT HIS WAY BUT HE HASNT TOLD US EVERYTHING SOMETHING SCARED MR FRODO BADLY HE SCREWED HIMSELF UP TO THE POINT SUDDEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND AT LAST TO GO WHERE TO OFF EAST NOT WITHOUT SAM YES WITHOUT EVEN HIS SAM THATS HARD CRUEL HARD
SAM PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES BRUSHING AWAY THE TEARS STEADY GAMGEE HE SAID THINK IF YOU CAN HE CANT FLY ACROSS RIVERS AND HE CANT JUMP WATERFALLS HES GOT NO GEAR SO HES GOT TO GET BACK TO THE BOATS BACK TO THE BOATS BACK TO THE BOATS SAM LIKE LIGHTNING
SAM TURNED AND BOLTED BACK DOWN THE PATH HE FELL AND CUT HIS KNEES UP HE GOT AND RAN ON HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE LAWN OF PARTH GALEN BY THE SHORE WHERE THE BOATS WERE DRAWN UP OUT OF THE WATER NO ONE WAS THERE THERE SEEMED TO BE CRIES IN THE WOODS BEHIND BUT HE DID NOT HEED THEM HE STOOD GAZING FOR A MOMENT STOCKSTILL GAPING A BOAT WAS SLIDING DOWN THE BANK ALL BY ITSELF WITH A SHOUT SAM RACED ACROSS THE GRASS THE BOAT SLIPPED INTO THE WATER
COMING MR FRODO COMING CALLED SAM AND FLUNG HIMSELF FROM THE BANK CLUTCHING AT THE DEPARTING BOAT HE MISSED IT BY A YARD WITH A CRY AND A SPLASH HE FELL FACE DOWNWARD INTO DEEP SWIFT WATER GURGLING HE WENT UNDER AND THE RIVER CLOSED OVER HIS CURLY HEAD
AN EXCLAMATION OF DISMAY CAME FROM THE EMPTY BOAT A PADDLE SWIRLED AND THE BOAT PUT ABOUT FRODO WAS JUST IN TIME TO GRASP SAM BY THE HAIR AS HE CAME UP BUBBLING AND STRUGGLING FEAR WAS STARING IN HIS ROUND BROWN EYES
UP YOU COME SAM MY LAD SAID FRODO NOW TAKE MY HAND
SAVE ME MR FRODO GASPED SAM IM DROWNDED I CANT SEE YOUR HAND
HERE IT IS DONT PINCH LAD I WONT LET YOU GO TREAD WATER AND DONT FLOUNDER OR YOULL UPSET THE BOAT THERE NOW GET HOLD OF THE SIDE AND LET ME USE THE PADDLE
WITH A FEW STROKES FRODO BROUGHT THE BOAT BACK TO THE BANK AND SAM WAS ABLE TO SCRAMBLE OUT WET AS A WATERRAT FRODO TOOK OFF THE RING AND STEPPED ASHORE AGAIN
OF ALL THE CONFOUNDED NUISANCES YOU ARE THE WORST SAM HE SAID
OH MR FRODO THATS HARD SAID SAM SHIVERING THATS HARD TRYING TO GO WITHOUT ME AND ALL IF I HADNT A GUESSED RIGHT WHERE WOULD YOU BE NOW
SAFELY ON MY WAY
SAFELY SAID SAM ALL ALONE AND WITHOUT ME TO HELP YOU I COULDNT HAVE A BORNE IT ITD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF ME
IT WOULD BE THE DEATH OF YOU TO COME WITH ME SAM SAID FRODO AND I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THAT
NOT AS CERTAIN AS BEING LEFT BEHIND SAID SAM
BUT I AM GOING TO MORDOR
I KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH MR FRODO OF COURSE YOU ARE AND IM COMING WITH YOU
NOW SAM SAID FRODO DONT HINDER ME THE OTHERS WILL BE COMING BACK AT ANY MINUTE IF THEY CATCH ME HERE I SHALL HAVE TO ARGUE AND EXPLAIN AND I SHALL NEVER HAVE THE HEART OR THE CHANCE TO GET OFF BUT I MUST GO AT ONCE ITS THE ONLY WAY
OF COURSE IT IS ANSWERED SAM BUT NOT ALONE IM COMING TOO OR NEITHER OF US ISNT GOING ILL KNOCK HOLES IN ALL THE BOATS FIRST
FRODO ACTUALLY LAUGHED A SUDDEN WARMTH AND GLADNESS TOUCHED HIS HEART LEAVE ONE HE SAID WELL NEED IT BUT YOU CANT COME LIKE THIS WITHOUT YOUR GEAR OR FOOD OR ANYTHING
JUST HOLD ON A MOMENT AND ILL GET MY STUFF CRIED SAM EAGERLY ITS ALL READY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE OFF TODAY HE RUSHED TO THE CAMPING PLACE FISHED OUT HIS PACK FROM THE PILE WHERE FRODO HAD LAID IT WHEN HE EMPTIED THE BOAT OF HIS COMPANIONS GOODS GRABBED A SPARE BLANKET AND SOME EXTRA PACKAGES OF FOOD AND RAN BACK
SO ALL MY PLAN IS SPOILT SAID FRODO IT IS NO GOOD TRYING TO ESCAPE YOU BUT IM GLAD SAM I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW GLAD COME ALONG IT IS PLAIN THAT WE WERE MEANT TO GO TOGETHER WE WILL GO AND MAY THE OTHERS FIND A SAFE ROAD STRIDER WILL LOOK AFTER THEM I DONT SUPPOSE WE SHALL SEE THEM AGAIN
YET WE MAY MR FRODO WE MAY SAID SAM
SO FRODO AND SAM SET OFF ON THE LAST STAGE OF THE QUEST TOGETHER FRODO PADDLED AWAY FROM THE SHORE AND THE RIVER BORE THEM SWIFTLY AWAY DOWN THE WESTERN ARM AND PAST THE FROWNING CLIFFS OF TOL BRANDIR THE ROAR OF THE GREAT FALLS DREW NEARER EVEN WITH SUCH HELP AS SAM COULD GIVE IT WAS HARD WORK TO PASS ACROSS THE CURRENT AT THE SOUTHWARD END OF THE ISLAND AND DRIVE THE BOAT EASTWARD TOWARDS THE FAR SHORE
AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO LAND AGAIN UPON THE SOUTHERN SLOPES OF AMON LHAW THERE THEY FOUND A SHELVING SHORE AND THEY DREW THE BOAT OUT HIGH ABOVE THE WATER AND HID IT AS WELL AS THEY COULD BEHIND A GREAT BOULDER THEN SHOULDERING THEIR BURDENS THEY SET OFF SEEKING A PATH THAT WOULD BRING THEM OVER THE GREY HILLS OF THE EMYN MUIL AND DOWN INTO THE LAND OF SHADOW
HERE ENDS THE FIRST PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE WAR OF THE RING
THE SECOND PART IS CALLED THE TWO TOWERS SINCE THE EVENTS RECOUNTED IN IT ARE DOMINATED BY ORTHANC THE CITADEL OF SARUMAN AND THE FORTRESS OF MINAS MORGUL THAT GUARDS THE SECRET ENTRANCE TO MORDOR IT TELLS OF THE DEEDS AND PERILS OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE NOW SUNDERED FELLOWSHIP UNTIL THE COMING OF THE GREAT DARKNESS
THE THIRD PART TELLS OF THE LAST DEFENCE AGAINST THE SHADOW AND THE END OF THE MISSION OF THE RINGBEARER IN THE RETURN OF THE KING

CHAPTER 1
THE DEPARTURE OF BOROMIR

ARAGORN SPED ON UP THE HILL EVERY NOW AND AGAIN HE BENT TO THE GROUND HOBBITS GO LIGHT AND THEIR FOOTPRINTS ARE NOT EASY EVEN FOR A RANGER TO READ BUT NOT FAR FROM THE TOP A SPRING CROSSED THE PATH AND IN THE WET EARTH HE SAW WHAT HE WAS SEEKING
I READ THE SIGNS ARIGHT HE SAID TO HIMSELF FRODO RAN TO THE HILLTOP I WONDER WHAT HE SAW THERE BUT HE RETURNED BY THE SAME WAY AND WENT DOWN THE HILL AGAIN
ARAGORN HESITATED HE DESIRED TO GO TO THE HIGH SEAT HIMSELF HOPING TO SEE THERE SOMETHING THAT WOULD GUIDE HIM IN HIS PERPLEXITIES BUT TIME WAS PRESSING SUDDENLY HE LEAPED FORWARD AND RAN TO THE SUMMIT ACROSS THE GREAT FLAGSTONES AND UP THE STEPS THEN SITTING IN THE HIGH SEAT HE LOOKED OUT BUT THE SUN SEEMED DARKENED AND THE WORLD DIM AND REMOTE HE TURNED FROM THE NORTH BACK AGAIN TO NORTH AND SAW NOTHING SAVE THE DISTANT HILLS UNLESS IT WERE THAT FAR AWAY HE COULD SEE AGAIN A GREAT BIRD LIKE AN EAGLE HIGH IN THE AIR DESCENDING SLOWLY IN WIDE CIRCLES DOWN TOWARDS THE EARTH
EVEN AS HE GAZED HIS QUICK EARS CAUGHT SOUNDS IN THE WOODLANDS BELOW ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIVER HE STIFFENED THERE WERE CRIES AND AMONG THEM TO HIS HORROR HE COULD DISTINGUISH THE HARSH VOICES OF ORCS THEN SUDDENLY WITH A DEEPTHROATED CALL A GREAT HORN BLEW AND THE BLASTS OF IT SMOTE THE HILLS AND ECHOED IN THE HOLLOWS RISING IN A MIGHTY SHOUT ABOVE THE ROARING OF THE FALLS
THE HORN OF BOROMIR HE CRIED HE IS IN NEED HE SPRANG DOWN THE STEPS AND AWAY LEAPING DOWN THE PATH ALAS AN ILL FATE IS ON ME THIS DAY AND ALL THAT I DO GOES AMISS WHERE IS SAM
AS HE RAN THE CRIES CAME LOUDER BUT FAINTER NOW AND DESPERATELY THE HORN WAS BLOWING FIERCE AND SHRILL ROSE THE YELLS OF THE ORCS AND SUDDENLY THE HORNCALLS CEASED ARAGORN RACED DOWN THE LAST SLOPE BUT BEFORE HE COULD REACH THE HILLS FOOT THE SOUNDS DIED AWAY AND AS HE TURNED TO THE LEFT AND RAN TOWARDS THEM THEY RETREATED UNTIL AT LAST HE COULD HEAR THEM NO MORE DRAWING HIS BRIGHT SWORD AND CRYING ELENDIL ELENDIL HE CRASHED THROUGH THE TREES
A MILE MAYBE FROM PARTH GALEN IN A LITTLE GLADE NOT FAR FROM THE LAKE HE FOUND BOROMIR HE WAS SITTING WITH HIS BACK TO A GREAT TREE AS IF HE WAS RESTING BUT ARAGORN SAW THAT HE WAS PIERCED WITH MANY BLACKFEATHERED ARROWS HIS SWORD WAS STILL IN HIS HAND BUT IT WAS BROKEN NEAR THE HILT HIS HORN CLOVEN IN TWO WAS AT HIS SIDE MANY ORCS LAY SLAIN PILED ALL ABOUT HIM AND AT HIS FEET
ARAGORN KNELT BESIDE HIM BOROMIR OPENED HIS EYES AND STROVE TO SPEAK AT LAST SLOW WORDS CAME I TRIED TO TAKE THE RING FROM FRODO HE SAID I AM SORRY I HAVE PAID HIS GLANCE STRAYED TO HIS FALLEN ENEMIES TWENTY AT LEAST LAY THERE THEY HAVE GONE THE HALFLINGS THE ORCS HAVE TAKEN THEM I THINK THEY ARE NOT DEAD ORCS BOUND THEM HE PAUSED AND HIS EYES CLOSED WEARILY AFTER A MOMENT HE SPOKE AGAIN
FAREWELL ARAGORN GO TO MINAS TIRITH AND SAVE MY PEOPLE I HAVE FAILED
NO SAID ARAGORN TAKING HIS HAND AND KISSING HIS BROW YOU HAVE CONQUERED FEW HAVE GAINED SUCH A VICTORY BE AT PEACE MINAS TIRITH SHALL NOT FALL
BOROMIR SMILED
WHICH WAY DID THEY GO WAS FRODO THERE SAID ARAGORN
BUT BOROMIR DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN
ALAS SAID ARAGORN THUS PASSES THE HEIR OF DENETHOR LORD OF THE TOWER OF GUARD THIS IS A BITTER END NOW THE COMPANY IS ALL IN RUIN IT IS I THAT HAVE FAILED VAIN WAS GANDALFS TRUST IN ME WHAT SHALL I DO NOW BOROMIR HAS LAID IT ON ME TO GO TO MINAS TIRITH AND MY HEART DESIRES IT BUT WHERE ARE THE RING AND THE BEARER HOW SHALL I FIND THEM AND SAVE THE QUEST FROM DISASTER
HE KNELT FOR A WHILE BENT WITH WEEPING STILL CLASPING BOROMIRS HAND SO IT WAS THAT LEGOLAS AND GIMLI FOUND HIM THEY CAME FROM THE WESTERN SLOPES OF THE HILL SILENTLY CREEPING THROUGH THE TREES AS IF THEY WERE HUNTING GIMLI HAD HIS AXE IN HAND AND LEGOLAS HIS LONG KNIFE ALL HIS ARROWS WERE SPENT WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE GLADE THEY HALTED IN AMAZEMENT AND THEN THEY STOOD A MOMENT WITH HEADS BOWED IN GRIEF FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM PLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED
ALAS SAID LEGOLAS COMING TO ARAGORNS SIDE WE HAVE HUNTED AND SLAIN MANY ORCS IN THE WOODS BUT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF MORE USE HERE WE CAME WHEN WE HEARD THE HORN  BUT TOO LATE IT SEEMS I FEAR YOU HAVE TAKEN DEADLY HURT
BOROMIR IS DEAD SAID ARAGORN I AM UNSCATHED FOR I WAS NOT HERE WITH HIM HE FELL DEFENDING THE HOBBITS WHILE I WAS AWAY UPON THE HILL
THE HOBBITS CRIED GIMLI WHERE ARE THEY THEN WHERE IS FRODO
I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED ARAGORN WEARILY BEFORE HE DIED BOROMIR TOLD ME THAT THE ORCS HAD BOUND THEM HE DID NOT THINK THAT THEY WERE DEAD I SENT HIM TO FOLLOW MERRY AND PIPPIN BUT I DID NOT ASK HIM IF FRODO OR SAM WERE WITH HIM NOT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE ALL THAT I HAVE DONE TODAY HAS GONE AMISS WHAT IS TO BE DONE NOW
FIRST WE MUST TEND THE FALLEN SAID LEGOLAS WE CANNOT LEAVE HIM LYING LIKE CARRION AMONG THESE FOUL ORCS
BUT WE MUST BE SWIFT SAID GIMLI HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO LINGER WE MUST FOLLOW THE ORCS IF THERE IS HOPE THAT ANY OF OUR COMPANY ARE LIVING PRISONERS
BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE RINGBEARER IS WITH THEM OR NOT SAID ARAGORN ARE WE TO ABANDON HIM MUST WE NOT SEEK HIM FIRST AN EVIL CHOICE IS NOW BEFORE US
THEN LET US DO FIRST WHAT WE MUST DO SAID LEGOLAS WE HAVE NOT THE TIME OR THE TOOLS TO BURY OUR COMRADE FITLY OR TO RAISE A MOUND OVER HIM A CAIRN WE MIGHT BUILD
THE LABOUR WOULD BE HARD AND LONG THERE ARE NO STONES THAT WE COULD USE NEARER THAN THE WATERSIDE SAID GIMLI
THEN LET US LAY HIM IN A BOAT WITH HIS WEAPONS AND THE WEAPONS OF HIS VANQUISHED FOES SAID ARAGORN WE WILL SEND HIM TO THE FALLS OF RAUROS AND GIVE HIM TO ANDUIN THE RIVER OF GONDOR WILL TAKE CARE AT LEAST THAT NO EVIL CREATURE DISHONOURS HIS BONES
QUICKLY THEY SEARCHED THE BODIES OF THE ORCS GATHERING THEIR SWORDS AND CLOVEN HELMS AND SHIELDS INTO A HEAP SEE CRIED ARAGORN HERE WE FIND TOKENS HE PICKED OUT FROM THE PILE OF GRIM WEAPONS TWO KNIVES LEAFBLADED DAMASKED IN GOLD AND RED AND SEARCHING FURTHER HE FOUND ALSO THE SHEATHS BLACK SET WITH SMALL RED GEMS NO ORCTOOLS THESE HE SAID THEY WERE BORNE BY THE HOBBITS DOUBTLESS THE ORCS DESPOILED THEM BUT FEARED TO KEEP THE KNIVES KNOWING THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE WORK OF WESTERNESSE WOUND ABOUT WITH SPELLS FOR THE BANE OF MORDOR WELL NOW IF THEY STILL LIVE OUR FRIENDS ARE WEAPONLESS I WILL TAKE THESE THINGS HOPING AGAINST HOPE TO GIVE THEM BACK
AND I SAID LEGOLAS WILL TAKE ALL THE ARROWS THAT I CAN FIND FOR MY QUIVER IS EMPTY HE SEARCHED IN THE PILE AND ON THE GROUND ABOUT AND FOUND NOT A FEW THAT WERE UNDAMAGED AND LONGER IN THE SHAFT THAN SUCH ARROWS AS THE ORCS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO USE HE LOOKED AT THEM CLOSELY
AND ARAGORN LOOKED ON THE SLAIN AND HE SAID HERE LIE MANY THAT ARE NOT FOLK OF MORDOR SOME ARE FROM THE NORTH FROM THE MISTY MOUNTAINS IF I KNOW ANYTHING OF ORCS AND THEIR KINDS AND HERE ARE OTHERS STRANGE TO ME THEIR GEAR IS NOT AFTER THE MANNER OF ORCS AT ALL
THERE WERE FOUR GOBLINSOLDIERS OF GREATER STATURE SWART SLANTEYED WITH THICK LEGS AND LARGE HANDS THEY WERE ARMED WITH SHORT BROADBLADED SWORDS NOT WITH THE CURVED SCIMITARS USUAL WITH ORCS AND THEY HAD BOWS OF YEW IN LENGTH AND SHAPE LIKE THE BOWS OF MEN UPON THEIR SHIELDS THEY BORE A STRANGE DEVICE A SMALL WHITE HAND IN THE CENTRE OF A BLACK FIELD ON THE FRONT OF THEIR IRON HELMS WAS SET AN SRUNE WROUGHT OF SOME WHITE METAL
I HAVE NOT SEEN THESE TOKENS BEFORE SAID ARAGORN WHAT DO THEY MEAN
S IS FOR SAURON SAID GIMLI THAT IS EASY TO READ
NAY SAID LEGOLAS SAURON DOES NOT USE THE ELFRUNES
NEITHER DOES HE USE HIS RIGHT NAME NOR PERMIT IT TO BE SPELT OR SPOKEN SAID ARAGORN AND HE DOES NOT USE WHITE THE ORCS IN THE SERVICE OF BARADDUR USE THE SIGN OF THE RED EYE HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT IN THOUGHT S IS FOR SARUMAN I GUESS HE SAID AT LENGTH THERE IS EVIL AFOOT IN ISENGARD AND THE WEST IS NO LONGER SAFE IT IS AS GANDALF FEARED BY SOME MEANS THE TRAITOR SARUMAN HAS HAD NEWS OF OUR JOURNEY IT IS LIKELY TOO THAT HE KNOWS OF GANDALFS FALL PURSUERS FROM MORIA MAY HAVE ESCAPED THE VIGILANCE OF LORIEN OR THEY MAY HAVE AVOIDED THAT LAND AND COME TO ISENGARD BY OTHER PATHS ORCS TRAVEL FAST BUT SARUMAN HAS MANY WAYS OF LEARNING NEWS DO YOU REMEMBER THE BIRDS
WELL WE HAVE NO TIME TO PONDER RIDDLES SAID GIMLI LET US BEAR BOROMIR AWAY
BUT AFTER THAT WE MUST GUESS THE RIDDLES IF WE ARE TO CHOOSE OUR COURSE RIGHTLY ANSWERED ARAGORN
MAYBE THERE IS NO RIGHT CHOICE SAID GIMLI
TAKING HIS AXE THE DWARF NOW CUT SEVERAL BRANCHES THESE THEY LASHED TOGETHER WITH BOWSTRINGS AND SPREAD THEIR CLOAKS UPON THE FRAME UPON THIS ROUGH BIER THEY CARRIED THE BODY OF THEIR COMPANION TO THE SHORE TOGETHER WITH SUCH TROPHIES OF HIS LAST BATTLE AS THEY CHOSE TO SEND FORTH WITH HIM IT WAS ONLY A SHORT WAY YET THEY FOUND IT NO EASY TASK FOR BOROMIR WAS A MAN BOTH TALL AND STRONG
AT THE WATERSIDE ARAGORN REMAINED WATCHING THE BIER WHILE LEGOLAS AND GIMLI HASTENED BACK ON FOOT TO PARTH GALEN IT WAS A MILE OR MORE AND IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY CAME BACK PADDLING TWO BOATS SWIFTLY ALONG THE SHORE
THERE IS A STRANGE TALE TO TELL SAID LEGOLAS THERE ARE ONLY TWO BOATS UPON THE BANK WE COULD FIND NO TRACE OF THE OTHER
HAVE ORCS BEEN THERE ASKED ARAGORN
WE SAW NO SIGNS OF THEM ANSWERED GIMLI AND ORCS WOULD HAVE TAKEN OR DESTROYED ALL THE BOATS AND THE BAGGAGE AS WELL
I WILL LOOK AT THE GROUND WHEN WE COME THERE SAID ARAGORN
NOW THEY LAID BOROMIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOAT THAT WAS TO BEAR HIM AWAY THE GREY HOOD AND ELVENCLOAK THEY FOLDED AND PLACED BENEATH HIS HEAD THEY COMBED HIS LONG DARK HAIR AND ARRAYED IT UPON HIS SHOULDERS THE GOLDEN BELT OF LORIEN GLEAMED ABOUT HIS WAIST HIS HELM THEY SET BESIDE HIM AND ACROSS HIS LAP THEY LAID THE CLOVEN HORN AND THE HILTS AND SHARDS OF HIS SWORD BENEATH HIS FEET THEY PUT THE SWORDS OF HIS ENEMIES THEN FASTENING THE PROW TO THE STERN OF THE OTHER BOAT THEY DREW HIM OUT INTO THE WATER THEY ROWED SADLY ALONG THE SHORE AND TURNING INTO THE SWIFTRUNNING CHANNEL THEY PASSED THE GREEN SWARD OF PARTH GALEN THE STEEP SIDES OF TOL BRANDIR WERE GLOWING IT WAS NOW MIDAFTERNOON AS THEY WENT SOUTH THE FUME OF RAUROS ROSE AND SHIMMERED BEFORE THEM A HAZE OF GOLD THE RUSH AND THUNDER OF THE FALLS SHOOK THE WINDLESS AIR
SORROWFULLY THEY CAST LOOSE THE FUNERAL BOAT THERE BOROMIR LAY RESTFUL PEACEFUL GLIDING UPON THE BOSOM OF THE FLOWING WATER THE STREAM TOOK HIM WHILE THEY HELD THEIR OWN BOAT BACK WITH THEIR PADDLES HE FLOATED BY THEM AND SLOWLY HIS BOAT DEPARTED WANING TO A DARK SPOT AGAINST THE GOLDEN LIGHT AND THEN SUDDENLY IT VANISHED RAUROS ROARED ON UNCHANGING THE RIVER HAD TAKEN BOROMIR SON OF DENETHOR AND HE WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN IN MINAS TIRITH STANDING AS HE USED TO STAND UPON THE WHITE TOWER IN THE MORNING BUT IN GONDOR IN AFTERDAYS IT LONG WAS SAID THAT THE ELVENBOAT RODE THE FALLS AND THE FOAMING POOL AND BORE HIM DOWN THROUGH OSGILIATH AND PAST THE MANY MOUTHS OF ANDUIN OUT INTO THE GREAT SEA AT NIGHT UNDER THE STARS
FOR A WHILE THE THREE COMPANIONS REMAINED SILENT GAZING AFTER HIM THEN ARAGORN SPOKE THEY WILL LOOK FOR HIM FROM THE WHITE TOWER HE SAID BUT HE WILL NOT RETURN FROM MOUNTAIN OR FROM SEA THEN SLOWLY HE BEGAN TO SING
THROUGH ROHAN OVER FEN AND FIELD WHERE THE LONG GRASS GROWS
THE WEST WIND COMES WALKING AND ABOUT THE WALLS IT GOES
WHAT NEWS FROM THE WEST O WANDERING WIND DO YOU BRING TO ME TONIGHT
HAVE YOU SEEN BOROMIR THE TALL BY MOON OR BY STARLIGHT
I SAW HIM RIDE OVER SEVEN STREAMS OVER WATERS WIDE AND GREY
I SAW HIM WALK IN EMPTY LANDS UNTIL HE PASSED AWAY
INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE NORTH I SAW HIM THEN NO MORE
THE NORTH WIND MAY HAVE HEARD THE HORN OF THE SON OF DENETHOR
O BOROMIR FROM THE HIGH WALLS WESTWARD I LOOKED AFAR
BUT YOU CAME NOT FROM THE EMPTY LANDS WHERE NO MEN ARE

THEN LEGOLAS SANG
FROM THE MOUTHS OF THE SEA THE SOUTH WIND FLIES FROM THE SANDHILLS AND THE STONES
THE WAILING OF THE GULLS IT BEARS AND AT THE GATE IT MOANS
WHAT NEWS FROM THE SOUTH O SIGHING WIND DO YOU BRING TO ME AT EVE
WHERE NOW IS BOROMIR THE FAIR HE TARRIES AND I GRIEVE
ASK NOT OF ME WHERE HE DOTH DWELL  SO MANY BONES THERE LIE
ON THE WHITE SHORES AND THE DARK SHORES UNDER THE STORMY SKY
SO MANY HAVE PASSED DOWN ANDUIN TO FIND THE FLOWING SEA
ASK OF THE NORTH WIND NEWS OF THEM THE NORTH WIND SENDS TO ME
O BOROMIR BEYOND THE GATE THE SEAWARD ROAD RUNS SOUTH
BUT YOU CAME NOT WITH THE WAILING GULLS FROM THE GREY SEAS MOUTH

THEN ARAGORN SANG AGAIN
FROM THE GATE OF KINGS THE NORTH WIND RIDES AND PAST THE ROARING FALLS
AND CLEAR AND COLD ABOUT THE TOWER ITS LOUD HORN CALLS
WHAT NEWS FROM THE NORTH O MIGHTY WIND DO YOU BRING TO ME TODAY
WHAT NEWS OF BOROMIR THE BOLD FOR HE IS LONG AWAY
BENEATH AMON HEN I HEARD HIS CRY THERE MANY FOES HE FOUGHT
HIS CLOVEN SHIELD HIS BROKEN SWORD THEY TO THE WATER BROUGHT
HIS HEAD SO PROUD HIS FACE SO FAIR HIS LIMBS THEY LAID TO REST
AND RAUROS GOLDEN RAUROSFALLS BORE HIM UPON ITS BREAST
O BOROMIR THE TOWER OF GUARD SHALL EVER NORTHWARD GAZE
TO RAUROS GOLDEN RAUROSFALLS UNTIL THE END OF DAYS

SO THEY ENDED THEN THEY TURNED THEIR BOAT AND DROVE IT WITH ALL THE SPEED THEY COULD AGAINST THE STREAM BACK TO PARTH GALEN
YOU LEFT THE EAST WIND TO ME SAID GIMLI BUT I WILL SAY NAUGHT OF IT
THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE SAID ARAGORN IN MINAS TIRITH THEY ENDURE THE EAST WIND BUT THEY DO NOT ASK IT FOR TIDINGS BUT NOW BOROMIR HAS TAKEN HIS ROAD AND WE MUST MAKE HASTE TO CHOOSE OUR OWN
HE SURVEYED THE GREEN LAWN QUICKLY BUT THOROUGHLY STOOPING OFTEN TO THE EARTH THE ORCS HAVE BEEN ON THIS GROUND HE SAID OTHERWISE NOTHING CAN BE MADE OUT FOR CERTAIN ALL OUR FOOTPRINTS ARE HERE CROSSING AND RECROSSING I CANNOT TELL WHETHER ANY OF THE HOBBITS HAVE COME BACK SINCE THE SEARCH FOR FRODO BEGAN HE RETURNED TO THE BANK CLOSE TO WHERE THE RILL FROM THE SPRING TRICKLED OUT INTO THE RIVER THERE ARE SOME CLEAR PRINTS HERE HE SAID A HOBBIT WADED OUT INTO THE WATER AND BACK BUT I CANNOT SAY HOW LONG AGO
HOW THEN DO YOU READ THIS RIDDLE ASKED GIMLI
ARAGORN DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE BUT WENT BACK TO THE CAMPINGPLACE AND LOOKED AT THE BAGGAGE TWO PACKS ARE MISSING HE SAID AND ONE IS CERTAINLY SAMS IT WAS RATHER LARGE AND HEAVY THIS THEN IS THE ANSWER FRODO HAS GONE BY BOAT AND HIS SERVANT HAS GONE WITH HIM FRODO MUST HAVE RETURNED WHILE WE WERE ALL AWAY I MET SAM GOING UP THE HILL AND TOLD HIM TO FOLLOW ME BUT PLAINLY HE DID NOT DO SO HE GUESSED HIS MASTERS MIND AND CAME BACK HERE BEFORE FRODO HAD GONE HE DID NOT FIND IT EASY TO LEAVE SAM BEHIND
BUT WHY SHOULD HE LEAVE US BEHIND AND WITHOUT A WORD SAID GIMLI THAT WAS A STRANGE DEED
AND A BRAVE DEED SAID ARAGORN SAM WAS RIGHT I THINK FRODO DID NOT WISH TO LEAD ANY FRIEND TO DEATH WITH HIM IN MORDOR BUT HE KNEW THAT HE MUST GO HIMSELF SOMETHING HAPPENED AFTER HE LEFT US THAT OVERCAME HIS FEAR AND DOUBT
MAYBE HUNTING ORCS CAME ON HIM AND HE FLED SAID LEGOLAS
HE FLED CERTAINLY SAID ARAGORN BUT NOT I THINK FROM ORCS WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE CAUSE OF FRODOS SUDDEN RESOLVE AND FLIGHT ARAGORN DID NOT SAY THE LAST WORDS OF BOROMIR HE LONG KEPT SECRET
WELL SO MUCH AT LEAST IS NOW CLEAR SAID LEGOLAS FRODO IS NO LONGER ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER ONLY HE CAN HAVE TAKEN THE BOAT AND SAM IS WITH HIM ONLY HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS PACK
OUR CHOICE THEN SAID GIMLI IS EITHER TO TAKE THE REMAINING BOAT AND FOLLOW FRODO OR ELSE TO FOLLOW THE ORCS ON FOOT THERE IS LITTLE HOPE EITHER WAY WE HAVE ALREADY LOST PRECIOUS HOURS
LET ME THINK SAID ARAGORN AND NOW MAY I MAKE A RIGHT CHOICE AND CHANGE THE EVIL FATE OF THIS UNHAPPY DAY HE STOOD SILENT FOR A MOMENT I WILL FOLLOW THE ORCS HE SAID AT LAST I WOULD HAVE GUIDED FRODO TO MORDOR AND GONE WITH HIM TO THE END BUT IF I SEEK HIM NOW IN THE WILDERNESS I MUST ABANDON THE CAPTIVES TO TORMENT AND DEATH MY HEART SPEAKS CLEARLY AT LAST THE FATE OF THE BEARER IS IN MY HANDS NO LONGER THE COMPANY HAS PLAYED ITS PART YET WE THAT REMAIN CANNOT FORSAKE OUR COMPANIONS WHILE WE HAVE STRENGTH LEFT COME WE WILL GO NOW LEAVE ALL THAT CAN BE SPARED BEHIND WE WILL PRESS ON BY DAY AND DARK
THEY DREW UP THE LAST BOAT AND CARRIED IT TO THE TREES THEY LAID BENEATH IT SUCH OF THEIR GOODS AS THEY DID NOT NEED AND COULD NOT CARRY AWAY THEN THEY LEFT PARTH GALEN THE AFTERNOON WAS FADING AS THEY CAME BACK TO THE GLADE WHERE BOROMIR HAD FALLEN THERE THEY PICKED UP THE TRAIL OF THE ORCS IT NEEDED LITTLE SKILL TO FIND
NO OTHER FOLK MAKE SUCH A TRAMPLING SAID LEGOLAS IT SEEMS THEIR DELIGHT TO SLASH AND BEAT DOWN GROWING THINGS THAT ARE NOT EVEN IN THEIR WAY
BUT THEY GO WITH A GREAT SPEED FOR ALL THAT SAID ARAGORN AND THEY DO NOT TIRE AND LATER WE MAY HAVE TO SEARCH FOR OUR PATH IN HARD BARE LANDS
WELL AFTER THEM SAID GIMLI DWARVES TOO CAN GO SWIFTLY AND THEY DO NOT TIRE SOONER THAN ORCS BUT IT WILL BE A LONG CHASE THEY HAVE A LONG START
YES SAID ARAGORN WE SHALL ALL NEED THE ENDURANCE OF DWARVES BUT COME WITH HOPE OR WITHOUT HOPE WE WILL FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF OUR ENEMIES AND WOE TO THEM IF WE PROVE THE SWIFTER WE WILL MAKE SUCH A CHASE AS SHALL BE ACCOUNTED A MARVEL AMONG THE THREE KINDREDS ELVES DWARVES AND MEN FORTH THE THREE HUNTERS
LIKE A DEER HE SPRANG AWAY THROUGH THE TREES HE SPED ON AND ON HE LED THEM TIRELESS AND SWIFT NOW THAT HIS MIND WAS AT LAST MADE UP THE WOODS ABOUT THE LAKE THEY LEFT BEHIND LONG SLOPES THEY CLIMBED DARK HARDEDGED AGAINST THE SKY ALREADY RED WITH SUNSET DUSK CAME THEY PASSED AWAY GREY SHADOWS IN A STONY LAND



CHAPTER 2
THE RIDERS OF ROHAN

DUSK DEEPENED MIST LAY BEHIND THEM AMONG THE TREES BELOW AND BROODED ON THE PALE MARGINS OF THE ANDUIN BUT THE SKY WAS CLEAR STARS CAME OUT THE WAXING MOON WAS RIDING IN THE WEST AND THE SHADOWS OF THE ROCKS WERE BLACK THEY HAD COME TO THE FEET OF STONY HILLS AND THEIR PACE WAS SLOWER FOR THE TRAIL WAS NO LONGER EASY TO FOLLOW HERE THE HIGHLANDS OF THE EMYN MUIL RAN FROM NORTH TO SOUTH IN TWO LONG TUMBLED RIDGES THE WESTERN SIDE OF EACH RIDGE WAS STEEP AND DIFFICULT BUT THE EASTWARD SLOPES WERE GENTLER FURROWED WITH MANY GULLIES AND NARROW RAVINES ALL NIGHT THE THREE COMPANIONS SCRAMBLED IN THIS BONY LAND CLIMBING TO THE CREST OF THE FIRST AND TALLEST RIDGE AND DOWN AGAIN INTO THE DARKNESS OF A DEEP WINDING VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE
THERE IN THE STILL COOL HOUR BEFORE DAWN THEY RESTED FOR A BRIEF SPACE THE MOON HAD LONG GONE DOWN BEFORE THEM THE STARS GLITTERED ABOVE THEM THE FIRST LIGHT OF DAY HAD NOT YET COME OVER THE DARK HILLS BEHIND FOR THE MOMENT ARAGORN WAS AT A LOSS THE ORCTRAIL HAD DESCENDED INTO THE VALLEY BUT THERE IT HAD VANISHED
WHICH WAY WOULD THEY TURN DO YOU THINK SAID LEGOLAS NORTHWARD TO TAKE A STRAIGHTER ROAD TO ISENGARD OR FANGORN IF THAT IS THEIR AIM AS YOU GUESS OR SOUTHWARD TO STRIKE THE ENTWASH
THEY WILL NOT MAKE FOR THE RIVER WHATEVER MARK THEY AIM AT SAID ARAGORN AND UNLESS THERE IS MUCH AMISS IN ROHAN AND THE POWER OF SARUMAN IS GREATLY INCREASED THEY WILL TAKE THE SHORTEST WAY THAT THEY CAN FIND OVER THE FIELDS OF THE ROHIRRIM LET US SEARCH NORTHWARDS
THE DALE RAN LIKE A STONY TROUGH BETWEEN THE RIDGED HILLS AND A TRICKLING STREAM FLOWED AMONG THE BOULDERS AT THE BOTTOM A CLIFF FROWNED UPON THEIR RIGHT TO THEIR LEFT ROSE GREY SLOPES DIM AND SHADOWY IN THE LATE NIGHT THEY WENT ON FOR A MILE OR MORE NORTHWARDS ARAGORN WAS SEARCHING BENT TOWARDS THE GROUND AMONG THE FOLDS AND GULLIES LEADING UP INTO THE WESTERN RIDGE LEGOLAS WAS SOME WAY AHEAD SUDDENLY THE ELF GAVE A CRY AND THE OTHERS CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM
WE HAVE ALREADY OVERTAKEN SOME OF THOSE THAT WE ARE HUNTING HE SAID LOOK HE POINTED AND THEY SAW THAT WHAT THEY HAD AT FIRST TAKEN TO BE BOULDERS LYING AT THE FOOT OF THE SLOPE WERE HUDDLED BODIES FIVE DEAD ORCS LAY THERE THEY HAD BEEN HEWN WITH MANY CRUEL STROKES AND TWO HAD BEEN BEHEADED THE GROUND WAS WET WITH THEIR DARK BLOOD
HERE IS ANOTHER RIDDLE SAID GIMLI BUT IT NEEDS THE LIGHT OF DAY AND FOR THAT WE CANNOT WAIT
YET HOWEVER YOU READ IT IT SEEMS NOT UNHOPEFUL SAID LEGOLAS ENEMIES OF THE ORCS ARE LIKELY TO BE OUR FRIENDS DO ANY FOLK DWELL IN THESE HILLS
NO SAID ARAGORN THE ROHIRRIM SELDOM COME HERE AND IT IS FAR FROM MINAS TIRITH IT MIGHT BE THAT SOME COMPANY OF MEN WERE HUNTING HERE FOR REASONS THAT WE DO NOT KNOW YET I THINK NOT
WHAT DO YOU THINK SAID GIMLI
I THINK THAT THE ENEMY BROUGHT HIS OWN ENEMY WITH HIM ANSWERED ARAGORN THESE ARE NORTHERN ORCS FROM FAR AWAY AMONG THE SLAIN ARE NONE OF THE GREAT ORCS WITH THE STRANGE BADGES THERE WAS A QUARREL I GUESS IT IS NO UNCOMMON THING WITH THESE FOUL FOLK MAYBE THERE WAS SOME DISPUTE ABOUT THE ROAD
OR ABOUT THE CAPTIVES SAID GIMLI LET US HOPE THAT THEY TOO DID NOT MEET THEIR END HERE
ARAGORN SEARCHED THE GROUND IN A WIDE CIRCLE BUT NO OTHER TRACES OF THE FIGHT COULD BE FOUND THEY WENT ON ALREADY THE EASTWARD SKY WAS TURNING PALE THE STARS WERE FADING AND A GREY LIGHT WAS SLOWLY GROWING A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH THEY CAME TO A FOLD IN WHICH A TINY STREAM FALLING AND WINDING HAD CUT A STONY PATH DOWN INTO THE VALLEY IN IT SOME BUSHES GREW AND THERE WERE PATCHES OF GRASS UPON ITS SIDES
AT LAST SAID ARAGORN HERE ARE THE TRACKS THAT WE SEEK UP THIS WATERCHANNEL THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE ORCS WENT AFTER THEIR DEBATE
SWIFTLY NOW THE PURSUERS TURNED AND FOLLOWED THE NEW PATH AS IF FRESH FROM A NIGHTS REST THEY SPRANG FROM STONE TO STONE AT LAST THEY REACHED THE CREST OF THE GREY HILL AND A SUDDEN BREEZE BLEW IN THEIR HAIR AND STIRRED THEIR CLOAKS THE CHILL WIND OF DAWN
TURNING BACK THEY SAW ACROSS THE RIVER THE FAR HILLS KINDLED DAY LEAPED INTO THE SKY THE RED RIM OF THE SUN ROSE OVER THE SHOULDERS OF THE DARK LAND BEFORE THEM IN THE WEST THE WORLD LAY STILL FORMLESS AND GREY BUT EVEN AS THEY LOOKED THE SHADOWS OF NIGHT MELTED THE COLOURS OF THE WAKING EARTH RETURNED GREEN FLOWED OVER THE WIDE MEADS OF ROHAN THE WHITE MISTS SHIMMERED IN THE WATERVALES AND FAR OFF TO THE LEFT THIRTY LEAGUES OR MORE BLUE AND PURPLE STOOD THE WHITE MOUNTAINS RISING INTO PEAKS OF JET TIPPED WITH GLIMMERING SNOWS FLUSHED WITH THE ROSE OF MORNING
GONDOR GONDOR CRIED ARAGORN WOULD THAT I LOOKED ON YOU AGAIN IN HAPPIER HOUR NOT YET DOES MY ROAD LIE SOUTHWARD TO YOUR BRIGHT STREAMS
GONDOR GONDOR BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA
WEST WIND BLEW THERE THE LIGHT UPON THE SILVER TREE
FELL LIKE BRIGHT RAIN IN GARDENS OF THE KINGS OF OLD
O PROUD WALLS WHITE TOWERS O WINGED CROWN AND THRONE OF GOLD
O GONDOR GONDOR SHALL MEN BEHOLD THE SILVER TREE
OR WEST WIND BLOW AGAIN BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA

NOW LET US GO HE SAID DRAWING HIS EYES AWAY FROM THE SOUTH AND LOOKING OUT WEST AND NORTH TO THE WAY THAT HE MUST TREAD
THE RIDGE UPON WHICH THE COMPANIONS STOOD WENT DOWN STEEPLY BEFORE THEIR FEET BELOW IT TWENTY FATHOMS OR MORE THERE WAS A WIDE AND RUGGED SHELF WHICH ENDED SUDDENLY IN THE BRINK OF A SHEER CLIFF THE EAST WALL OF ROHAN SO ENDED THE EMYN MUIL AND THE GREEN PLAINS OF THE ROHIRRIM STRETCHED AWAY BEFORE THEM TO THE EDGE OF SIGHT
LOOK CRIED LEGOLAS POINTING UP INTO THE PALE SKY ABOVE THEM THERE IS THE EAGLE AGAIN HE IS VERY HIGH HE SEEMS TO BE FLYING NOW AWAY FROM THIS LAND BACK TO THE NORTH HE IS GOING WITH GREAT SPEED LOOK
NO NOT EVEN MY EYES CAN SEE HIM MY GOOD LEGOLAS SAID ARAGORN HE MUST BE FAR ALOFT INDEED I WONDER WHAT IS HIS ERRAND IF HE IS THE SAME BIRD THAT I HAVE SEEN BEFORE BUT LOOK I CAN SEE SOMETHING NEARER AT HAND AND MORE URGENT THERE IS SOMETHING MOVING OVER THE PLAIN
MANY THINGS SAID LEGOLAS IT IS A GREAT COMPANY ON FOOT BUT I CANNOT SAY MORE NOR SEE WHAT KIND OF FOLK THEY MAY BE THEY ARE MANY LEAGUES AWAY TWELVE I GUESS BUT THE FLATNESS OF THE PLAIN IS HARD TO MEASURE
I THINK NONETHELESS THAT WE NO LONGER NEED ANY TRAIL TO TELL US WHICH WAY TO GO SAID GIMLI LET US FIND A PATH DOWN TO THE FIELDS AS QUICK AS MAY BE
I DOUBT IF YOU WILL FIND A PATH QUICKER THAN THE ONE THAT THE ORCS CHOSE SAID ARAGORN
THEY FOLLOWED THEIR ENEMIES NOW BY THE CLEAR LIGHT OF DAY IT SEEMED THAT THE ORCS HAD PRESSED ON WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THE PURSUERS FOUND THINGS THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED OR CAST AWAY FOODBAGS THE RINDS AND CRUSTS OF HARD GREY BREAD A TORN BLACK CLOAK A HEAVY IRONNAILED SHOE BROKEN ON THE STONES THE TRAIL LED THEM NORTH ALONG THE TOP OF THE ESCARPMENT AND AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO A DEEP CLEFT CARVED IN THE ROCK BY A STREAM THAT SPLASHED NOISILY DOWN IN THE NARROW RAVINE A ROUGH PATH DESCENDED LIKE A STEEP STAIR INTO THE PLAIN

AT THE BOTTOM THEY CAME WITH A STRANGE SUDDENNESS ON THE GRASS OF ROHAN IT SWELLED LIKE A GREEN SEA UP TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE EMYN MUIL THE FALLING STREAM VANISHED INTO A DEEP GROWTH OF CRESSES AND WATERPLANTS AND THEY COULD HEAR IT TINKLING AWAY IN GREEN TUNNELS DOWN LONG GENTLE SLOPES TOWARDS THE FENS OF ENTWASH VALE FAR AWAY THEY SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT WINTER CLINGING TO THE HILLS BEHIND HERE THE AIR WAS SOFTER AND WARMER AND FAINTLY SCENTED AS IF SPRING WAS ALREADY STIRRING AND THE SAP WAS FLOWING AGAIN IN HERB AND LEAF LEGOLAS TOOK A DEEP BREATH LIKE ONE THAT DRINKS A GREAT DRAUGHT AFTER LONG THIRST IN BARREN PLACES
AH THE GREEN SMELL HE SAID IT IS BETTER THAN MUCH SLEEP LET US RUN
LIGHT FEET MAY RUN SWIFTLY HERE SAID ARAGORN MORE SWIFTLY MAYBE THAN IRONSHOD ORCS NOW WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LESSEN THEIR LEAD
THEY WENT IN SINGLE FILE RUNNING LIKE HOUNDS ON A STRONG SCENT AND AN EAGER LIGHT WAS IN THEIR EYES NEARLY DUE WEST THE BROAD SWATH OF THE MARCHING ORCS TRAMPED ITS UGLY SLOT THE SWEET GRASS OF ROHAN HAD BEEN BRUISED AND BLACKENED AS THEY PASSED PRESENTLY ARAGORN GAVE A CRY AND TURNED ASIDE STAY HE SHOUTED DO NOT FOLLOW ME YET HE RAN QUICKLY TO THE RIGHT AWAY FROM THE MAIN TRAIL FOR HE HAD SEEN FOOTPRINTS THAT WENT THAT WAY BRANCHING OFF FROM THE OTHERS THE MARKS OF SMALL UNSHOD FEET THESE HOWEVER DID NOT GO FAR BEFORE THEY WERE CROSSED BY ORCPRINTS ALSO COMING OUT FROM THE MAIN TRAIL BEHIND AND IN FRONT AND THEN THEY CURVED SHARPLY BACK AGAIN AND WERE LOST IN THE TRAMPLING AT THE FURTHEST POINT ARAGORN STOOPED AND PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GRASS THEN HE RAN BACK
YES HE SAID THEY ARE QUITE PLAIN A HOBBITS FOOTPRINTS PIPPINS I THINK HE IS SMALLER THAN THE OTHER AND LOOK AT THIS HE HELD UP A THING THAT GLITTERED IN THE SUNLIGHT IT LOOKED LIKE THE NEWOPENED LEAF OF A BEECHTREE FAIR AND STRANGE IN THAT TREELESS PLAIN
THE BROOCH OF AN ELVENCLOAK CRIED LEGOLAS AND GIMLI TOGETHER
NOT IDLY DO THE LEAVES OF LORIEN FALL SAID ARAGORN THIS DID NOT DROP BY CHANCE IT WAS CAST AWAY AS A TOKEN TO ANY THAT MIGHT FOLLOW I THINK PIPPIN RAN AWAY FROM THE TRAIL FOR THAT PURPOSE
THEN HE AT LEAST WAS ALIVE SAID GIMLI AND HE HAD THE USE OF HIS WITS AND OF HIS LEGS TOO THAT IS HEARTENING WE DO NOT PURSUE IN VAIN
LET US HOPE THAT HE DID NOT PAY TOO DEARLY FOR HIS BOLDNESS SAID LEGOLAS COME LET US GO ON THE THOUGHT OF THOSE MERRY YOUNG FOLK DRIVEN LIKE CATTLE BURNS MY HEART
THE SUN CLIMBED TO THE NOON AND THEN RODE SLOWLY DOWN THE SKY LIGHT CLOUDS CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA IN THE DISTANT SOUTH AND WERE BLOWN AWAY UPON THE BREEZE THE SUN SANK SHADOWS ROSE BEHIND AND REACHED OUT LONG ARMS FROM THE EAST STILL THE HUNTERS HELD ON ONE DAY NOW HAD PASSED SINCE BOROMIR FELL AND THE ORCS WERE YET FAR AHEAD NO LONGER COULD ANY SIGHT OF THEM BE SEEN IN THE LEVEL PLAINS
AS NIGHTSHADE WAS CLOSING ABOUT THEM ARAGORN HALTED ONLY TWICE IN THE DAYS MARCH HAD THEY RESTED FOR A BRIEF WHILE AND TWELVE LEAGUES NOW LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE EASTERN WALL WHERE THEY HAD STOOD AT DAWN
WE HAVE COME AT LAST TO A HARD CHOICE HE SAID SHALL WE REST BY NIGHT OR SHALL WE GO ON WHILE OUR WILL AND STRENGTH HOLD
UNLESS OUR ENEMIES REST ALSO THEY WILL LEAVE US FAR BEHIND IF WE STAY TO SLEEP SAID LEGOLAS
SURELY EVEN ORCS MUST PAUSE ON THE MARCH SAID GIMLI
SELDOM WILL ORCS JOURNEY IN THE OPEN UNDER THE SUN YET THESE HAVE DONE SO SAID LEGOLAS CERTAINLY THEY WILL NOT REST BY NIGHT
BUT IF WE WALK BY NIGHT WE CANNOT FOLLOW THEIR TRAIL SAID GIMLI
THE TRAIL IS STRAIGHT AND TURNS NEITHER RIGHT NOR LEFT AS FAR AS MY EYES CAN SEE SAID LEGOLAS
MAYBE I COULD LEAD YOU AT GUESS IN THE DARKNESS AND HOLD TO THE LINE SAID ARAGORN BUT IF WE STRAYED OR THEY TURNED ASIDE THEN WHEN LIGHT CAME THERE MIGHT BE LONG DELAY BEFORE THE TRAIL WAS FOUND AGAIN
AND THERE IS THIS ALSO SAID GIMLI ONLY BY DAY CAN WE SEE IF ANY TRACKS LEAD AWAY IF A PRISONER SHOULD ESCAPE OR IF ONE SHOULD BE CARRIED OFF EASTWARD SAY TO THE GREAT RIVER TOWARDS MORDOR WE MIGHT PASS THE SIGNS AND NEVER KNOW IT
THAT IS TRUE SAID ARAGORN BUT IF I READ THE SIGNS BACK YONDER RIGHTLY THE ORCS OF THE WHITE HAND PREVAILED AND THE WHOLE COMPANY IS NOW BOUND FOR ISENGARD THEIR PRESENT COURSE BEARS ME OUT
YET IT WOULD BE RASH TO BE SURE OF THEIR COUNSELS SAID GIMLI AND WHAT OF ESCAPE IN THE DARK WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED THE SIGNS THAT LED YOU TO THE BROOCH
THE ORCS WILL BE DOUBLY ON THEIR GUARD SINCE THEN AND THE PRISONERS EVEN WEARIER SAID LEGOLAS THERE WILL BE NO ESCAPE AGAIN IF WE DO NOT CONTRIVE IT HOW THAT IS TO BE DONE CANNOT BE GUESSED BUT FIRST WE MUST OVERTAKE THEM
AND YET EVEN I DWARF OF MANY JOURNEYS AND NOT THE LEAST HARDY OF MY FOLK CANNOT RUN ALL THE WAY TO ISENGARD WITHOUT ANY PAUSE SAID GIMLI MY HEART BURNS ME TOO AND I WOULD HAVE STARTED SOONER BUT NOW I MUST REST A LITTLE TO RUN THE BETTER AND IF WE REST THEN THE BLIND NIGHT IS THE TIME TO DO SO
I SAID THAT IT WAS A HARD CHOICE SAID ARAGORN HOW SHALL WE END THIS DEBATE
YOU ARE OUR GUIDE SAID GIMLI AND YOU ARE SKILLED IN THE CHASE YOU SHALL CHOOSE
MY HEART BIDS ME GO ON SAID LEGOLAS BUT WE MUST HOLD TOGETHER I WILL FOLLOW YOUR COUNSEL
YOU GIVE THE CHOICE TO AN ILL CHOOSER SAID ARAGORN SINCE WE PASSED THROUGH THE ARGONATH MY CHOICES HAVE GONE AMISS HE FELL SILENT GAZING NORTH AND WEST INTO THE GATHERING NIGHT FOR A LONG WHILE
WE WILL NOT WALK IN THE DARK HE SAID AT LENGTH THE PERIL OF MISSING THE TRAIL OR SIGNS OF OTHER COMING AND GOING SEEMS TO ME THE GREATER IF THE MOON GAVE ENOUGH LIGHT WE WOULD USE IT BUT ALAS HE SETS EARLY AND IS YET YOUNG AND PALE
AND TONIGHT HE IS SHROUDED ANYWAY GIMLI MURMURED WOULD THAT THE LADY HAD GIVEN US A LIGHT SUCH A GIFT AS SHE GAVE TO FRODO
IT WILL BE MORE NEEDED WHERE IT IS BESTOWED SAID ARAGORN WITH HIM LIES THE TRUE QUEST OURS IS BUT A SMALL MATTER IN THE GREAT DEEDS OF THIS TIME A VAIN PURSUIT FROM ITS BEGINNING MAYBE WHICH NO CHOICE OF MINE CAN MAR OR MEND WELL I HAVE CHOSEN SO LET US USE THE TIME AS BEST WE MAY
HE CAST HIMSELF ON THE GROUND AND FELL AT ONCE INTO SLEEP FOR HE HAD NOT SLEPT SINCE THEIR NIGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF TOL BRANDIR BEFORE DAWN WAS IN THE SKY HE WOKE AND ROSE GIMLI WAS STILL DEEP IN SLUMBER BUT LEGOLAS WAS STANDING GAZING NORTHWARDS INTO THE DARKNESS THOUGHTFUL AND SILENT AS A YOUNG TREE IN A WINDLESS NIGHT
THEY ARE FAR FAR AWAY HE SAID SADLY TURNING TO ARAGORN I KNOW IN MY HEART THAT THEY HAVE NOT RESTED THIS NIGHT ONLY AN EAGLE COULD OVERTAKE THEM NOW
NONETHELESS WE WILL STILL FOLLOW AS WE MAY SAID ARAGORN STOOPING HE ROUSED THE DWARF COME WE MUST GO HE SAID THE SCENT IS GROWING COLD
BUT IT IS STILL DARK SAID GIMLI EVEN LEGOLAS ON A HILLTOP COULD NOT SEE THEM TILL THE SUN IS UP
I FEAR THEY HAVE PASSED BEYOND MY SIGHT FROM HILL OR PLAIN UNDER MOON OR SUN SAID LEGOLAS
WHERE SIGHT FAILS THE EARTH MAY BRING US RUMOUR SAID ARAGORN THE LAND MUST GROAN UNDER THEIR HATED FEET HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND WITH HIS EAR PRESSED AGAINST THE TURF HE LAY THERE MOTIONLESS FOR SO LONG A TIME THAT GIMLI WONDERED IF HE HAD SWOONED OR FALLEN ASLEEP AGAIN DAWN CAME GLIMMERING AND SLOWLY A GREY LIGHT GREW ABOUT THEM AT LAST HE ROSE AND NOW HIS FRIENDS COULD SEE HIS FACE IT WAS PALE AND DRAWN AND HIS LOOK WAS TROUBLED
THE RUMOUR OF THE EARTH IS DIM AND CONFUSED HE SAID NOTHING WALKS UPON IT FOR MANY MILES ABOUT US FAINT AND FAR ARE THE FEET OF OUR ENEMIES BUT LOUD ARE THE HOOFS OF THE HORSES IT COMES TO MY MIND THAT I HEARD THEM EVEN AS I LAY ON THE GROUND IN SLEEP AND THEY TROUBLED MY DREAMS HORSES GALLOPING PASSING IN THE WEST BUT NOW THEY ARE DRAWING EVER FURTHER FROM US RIDING NORTHWARD I WONDER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS LAND
LET US GO SAID LEGOLAS
SO THE THIRD DAY OF THEIR PURSUIT BEGAN DURING ALL ITS LONG HOURS OF CLOUD AND FITFUL SUN THEY HARDLY PAUSED NOW STRIDING NOW RUNNING AS IF NO WEARINESS COULD QUENCH THE FIRE THAT BURNED THEM THEY SELDOM SPOKE OVER THE WIDE SOLITUDE THEY PASSED AND THEIR ELVENCLOAKS FADED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE GREYGREEN FIELDS EVEN IN THE COOL SUNLIGHT OF MIDDAY FEW BUT ELVISH EYES WOULD HAVE MARKED THEM UNTIL THEY WERE CLOSE AT HAND OFTEN IN THEIR HEARTS THEY THANKED THE LADY OF LORIEN FOR THE GIFT OF LEMBAS FOR THEY COULD EAT OF IT AND FIND NEW STRENGTH EVEN AS THEY RAN
ALL DAY THE TRACK OF THEIR ENEMIES LED STRAIGHT ON GOING NORTHWEST WITHOUT A BREAK OR TURN AS ONCE AGAIN THE DAY WORE TO ITS END THEY CAME TO LONG TREELESS SLOPES WHERE THE LAND ROSE SWELLING UP TOWARDS A LINE OF LOW HUMPBACKED DOWNS AHEAD THE ORCTRAIL GREW FAINTER AS IT BENT NORTH TOWARDS THEM FOR THE GROUND BECAME HARDER AND THE GRASS SHORTER FAR AWAY TO THE LEFT THE RIVER ENTWASH WOUND A SILVER THREAD IN A GREEN FLOOR NO MOVING THING COULD BE SEEN OFTEN ARAGORN WONDERED THAT THEY SAW NO SIGN OF BEAST OR MAN THE DWELLINGS OF THE ROHIRRIM WERE FOR THE MOST PART MANY LEAGUES AWAY TO THE SOUTH UNDER THE WOODED EAVES OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS NOW HIDDEN IN MIST AND CLOUD YET THE HORSELORDS HAD FORMERLY KEPT MANY HERDS AND STUDS IN THE EASTEMNET THIS EASTERLY REGION OF THEIR REALM AND THERE THE HERDSMEN HAD WANDERED MUCH LIVING IN CAMP AND TENT EVEN IN WINTERTIME BUT NOW ALL THE LAND WAS EMPTY AND THERE WAS SILENCE THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BE THE QUIET OF PEACE
AT DUSK THEY HALTED AGAIN NOW TWICE TWELVE LEAGUES THEY HAD PASSED OVER THE PLAINS OF ROHAN AND THE WALL OF THE EMYN MUIL WAS LOST IN THE SHADOWS OF THE EAST THE YOUNG MOON WAS GLIMMERING IN A MISTY SKY BUT IT GAVE SMALL LIGHT AND THE STARS WERE VEILED
NOW DO I MOST GRUDGE A TIME OF REST OR ANY HALT IN OUR CHASE SAID LEGOLAS THE ORCS HAVE RUN BEFORE US AS IF THE VERY WHIPS OF SAURON WERE BEHIND THEM I FEAR THEY HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE FOREST AND THE DARK HILLS AND EVEN NOW ARE PASSING INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE TREES
GIMLI GROUND HIS TEETH THIS IS A BITTER END TO OUR HOPE AND TO ALL OUR TOIL HE SAID
TO HOPE MAYBE BUT NOT TO TOIL SAID ARAGORN WE SHALL NOT TURN BACK HERE YET I AM WEARY HE GAZED BACK ALONG THE WAY THAT THEY HAD COME TOWARDS THE NIGHT GATHERING IN THE EAST THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE AT WORK IN THIS LAND I DISTRUST THE SILENCE I DISTRUST EVEN THE PALE MOON THE STARS ARE FAINT AND I AM WEARY AS I HAVE SELDOM BEEN BEFORE WEARY AS NO RANGER SHOULD BE WITH A CLEAR TRAIL TO FOLLOW THERE IS SOME WILL THAT LENDS SPEED TO OUR FOES AND SETS AN UNSEEN BARRIER BEFORE US A WEARINESS THAT IS IN THE HEART MORE THAN IN THE LIMB
TRULY SAID LEGOLAS THAT I HAVE KNOWN SINCE FIRST WE CAME DOWN FROM THE EMYN MUIL FOR THE WILL IS NOT BEHIND US BUT BEFORE US HE POINTED AWAY OVER THE LAND OF ROHAN INTO THE DARKLING WEST UNDER THE SICKLE MOON
SARUMAN MUTTERED ARAGORN BUT HE SHALL NOT TURN US BACK HALT WE MUST ONCE MORE FOR SEE EVEN THE MOON IS FALLING INTO GATHERING CLOUD BUT NORTH LIES OUR ROAD BETWEEN DOWN AND FEN WHEN DAY RETURNS
AS BEFORE LEGOLAS WAS FIRST AFOOT IF INDEED HE HAD EVER SLEPT AWAKE AWAKE HE CRIED IT IS A RED DAWN STRANGE THINGS AWAIT US BY THE EAVES OF THE FOREST GOOD OR EVIL I DO NOT KNOW BUT WE ARE CALLED AWAKE
THE OTHERS SPRANG UP AND ALMOST AT ONCE THEY SET OFF AGAIN SLOWLY THE DOWNS DREW NEAR IT WAS STILL AN HOUR BEFORE NOON WHEN THEY REACHED THEM GREEN SLOPES RISING TO BARE RIDGES THAT RAN IN A LINE STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THEIR FEET THE GROUND WAS DRY AND THE TURF SHORT BUT A LONG STRIP OF SUNKEN LAND SOME TEN MILES WIDE LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE RIVER WANDERING DEEP IN DIM THICKETS OF REED AND RUSH JUST TO THE WEST OF THE SOUTHERNMOST SLOPE THERE WAS A GREAT RING WHERE THE TURF HAD BEEN TORN AND BEATEN BY MANY TRAMPLING FEET FROM IT THE ORCTRAIL RAN OUT AGAIN TURNING NORTH ALONG THE DRY SKIRTS OF THE HILLS ARAGORN HALTED AND EXAMINED THE TRACKS CLOSELY
THEY RESTED HERE A WHILE HE SAID BUT EVEN THE OUTWARD TRAIL IS ALREADY OLD I FEAR THAT YOUR HEART SPOKE TRULY LEGOLAS IT IS THRICE TWELVE HOURS I GUESS SINCE THE ORCS STOOD WHERE WE NOW STAND IF THEY HELD TO THEIR PACE THEN AT SUNDOWN YESTERDAY THEY WOULD REACH THE BORDERS OF FANGORN
I CAN SEE NOTHING AWAY NORTH OR WEST BUT GRASS DWINDLING INTO MIST SAID GIMLI COULD WE SEE THE FOREST IF WE CLIMBED THE HILLS
IT IS STILL FAR AWAY SAID ARAGORN IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY THESE DOWNS RUN EIGHT LEAGUES OR MORE TO THE NORTH AND THEN NORTHWEST TO THE ISSUING OF THE ENTWASH THERE LIES STILL A WIDE LAND ANOTHER FIFTEEN LEAGUES IT MAY BE
WELL LET US GO ON SAID GIMLI MY LEGS MUST FORGET THE MILES THEY WOULD BE MORE WILLING IF MY HEART WERE LESS HEAVY
THE SUN WAS SINKING WHEN AT LAST THEY DREW NEAR TO THE END OF THE LINE OF DOWNS FOR MANY HOURS THEY HAD MARCHED WITHOUT REST THEY WERE GOING SLOWLY NOW AND GIMLIS BACK WAS BENT STONEHARD ARE THE DWARVES IN LABOUR OR JOURNEY BUT THIS ENDLESS CHASE BEGAN TO TELL ON HIM AS ALL HOPE FAILED IN HIS HEART ARAGORN WALKED BEHIND HIM GRIM AND SILENT STOOPING NOW AND AGAIN TO SCAN SOME PRINT OR MARK UPON THE GROUND ONLY LEGOLAS STILL STEPPED AS LIGHTLY AS EVER HIS FEET HARDLY SEEMING TO PRESS THE GRASS LEAVING NO FOOTPRINTS AS HE PASSED BUT IN THE WAYBREAD OF THE ELVES HE FOUND ALL THE SUSTENANCE THAT HE NEEDED AND HE COULD SLEEP IF SLEEP IT COULD BE CALLED BY MEN RESTING HIS MIND IN THE STRANGE PATHS OF ELVISH DREAMS EVEN AS HE WALKED OPENEYED IN THE LIGHT OF THIS WORLD
LET US GO UP ON TO THIS GREEN HILL HE SAID WEARILY THEY FOLLOWED HIM CLIMBING THE LONG SLOPE UNTIL THEY CAME OUT UPON THE TOP IT WAS A ROUND HILL SMOOTH AND BARE STANDING BY ITSELF THE MOST NORTHERLY OF THE DOWNS THE SUN SANK AND THE SHADOWS OF EVENING FELL LIKE A CURTAIN THEY WERE ALONE IN A GREY FORMLESS WORLD WITHOUT MARK OR MEASURE ONLY FAR AWAY NORTHWEST THERE WAS A DEEPER DARKNESS AGAINST THE DYING LIGHT THE MOUNTAINS OF MIST AND THE FOREST AT THEIR FEET
NOTHING CAN WE SEE TO GUIDE US HERE SAID GIMLI WELL NOW WE MUST HALT AGAIN AND WEAR THE NIGHT AWAY IT IS GROWING COLD
THE WIND IS NORTH FROM THE SNOWS SAID ARAGORN
AND ERE MORNING IT WILL BE IN THE EAST SAID LEGOLAS BUT REST IF YOU MUST YET DO NOT CAST ALL HOPE AWAY TOMORROW IS UNKNOWN REDE OFT IS FOUND AT THE RISING OF THE SUN
THREE SUNS ALREADY HAVE RISEN ON OUR CHASE AND BROUGHT NO COUNSEL SAID GIMLI
THE NIGHT GREW EVER COLDER ARAGORN AND GIMLI SLEPT FITFULLY AND WHENEVER THEY AWOKE THEY SAW LEGOLAS STANDING BESIDE THEM OR WALKING TO AND FRO SINGING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF IN HIS OWN TONGUE AND AS HE SANG THE WHITE STARS OPENED IN THE HARD BLACK VAULT ABOVE SO THE NIGHT PASSED TOGETHER THEY WATCHED THE DAWN GROW SLOWLY IN THE SKY NOW BARE AND CLOUDLESS UNTIL AT LAST THE SUNRISE CAME IT WAS PALE AND CLEAR THE WIND WAS IN THE EAST AND ALL THE MISTS HAD ROLLED AWAY WIDE LANDS LAY BLEAK ABOUT THEM IN THE BITTER LIGHT
AHEAD AND EASTWARD THEY SAW THE WINDY UPLANDS OF THE WOLD OF ROHAN THAT THEY HAD ALREADY GLIMPSED MANY DAYS AGO FROM THE GREAT RIVER NORTHWESTWARD STALKED THE DARK FOREST OF FANGORN STILL TEN LEAGUES AWAY STOOD ITS SHADOWY EAVES AND ITS FURTHER SLOPES FADED INTO THE DISTANT BLUE BEYOND THERE GLIMMERED FAR AWAY AS IF FLOATING ON A GREY CLOUD THE WHITE HEAD OF TALL METHEDRAS THE LAST PEAK OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS OUT OF THE FOREST THE ENTWASH FLOWED TO MEET THEM ITS STREAM NOW SWIFT AND NARROW AND ITS BANKS DEEPCLOVEN THE ORCTRAIL TURNED FROM THE DOWNS TOWARDS IT
FOLLOWING WITH HIS KEEN EYES THE TRAIL TO THE RIVER AND THEN THE RIVER BACK TOWARDS THE FOREST ARAGORN SAW A SHADOW ON THE DISTANT GREEN A DARK SWIFTMOVING BLUR HE CAST HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND AND LISTENED AGAIN INTENTLY BUT LEGOLAS STOOD BESIDE HIM SHADING HIS BRIGHT ELVENEYES WITH HIS LONG SLENDER HAND AND HE SAW NOT A SHADOW NOR A BLUR BUT THE SMALL FIGURES OF HORSEMEN MANY HORSEMEN AND THE GLINT OF MORNING ON THE TIPS OF THEIR SPEARS WAS LIKE THE TWINKLE OF MINUTE STARS BEYOND THE EDGE OF MORTAL SIGHT FAR BEHIND THEM A DARK SMOKE ROSE IN THIN CURLING THREADS
THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE EMPTY FIELDS ARID GIMLI COULD HEAR THE AIR MOVING IN THE GRASS
RIDERS CRIED ARAGORN SPRINGING TO HIS FEET MANY RIDERS ON SWIFT STEEDS ARE COMING TOWARDS US
YES SAID LEGOLAS THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE YELLOW IS THEIR HAIR AND BRIGHT ARE THEIR SPEARS THEIR LEADER IS VERY TALL
ARAGORN SMILED KEEN ARE THE EYES OF THE ELVES HE SAID
NAY THE RIDERS ARE LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE LEAGUES DISTANT SAID LEGOLAS
FIVE LEAGUES OR ONE SAID GIMLI WE CANNOT ESCAPE THEM IN THIS BARE LAND SHALL WE WAIT FOR THEM HERE OR GO ON OUR WAY
WE WILL WAIT SAID ARAGORN I AM WEARY AND OUR HUNT HAS FAILED OR AT LEAST OTHERS WERE BEFORE US FOR THESE HORSEMEN ARE RIDING BACK DOWN THE ORCTRAIL WE MAY GET NEWS FROM THEM
OR SPEARS SAID GIMLI
THERE ARE THREE EMPTY SADDLES BUT I SEE NO HOBBITS SAID LEGOLAS
I DID NOT SAY THAT WE SHOULD HEAR GOOD NEWS SAID ARAGORN BUT EVIL OR GOOD WE WILL AWAIT IT HERE
THE THREE COMPANIONS NOW LEFT THE HILLTOP WHERE THEY MIGHT BE AN EASY MARK AGAINST THE PALE SKY AND THEY WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE NORTHWARD SLOPE A LITTLE ABOVE THE HILLS FOOT THEY HALTED AND WRAPPING THEIR CLOAKS ABOUT THEM THEY SAT HUDDLED TOGETHER UPON THE FADED GRASS THE TIME PASSED SLOWLY AND HEAVILY THE WIND WAS THIN AND SEARCHING GIMLI WAS UNEASY
WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THESE HORSEMEN ARAGORN HE SAID DO WE SIT HERE WAITING FOR SUDDEN DEATH
I HAVE BEEN AMONG THEM ANSWERED ARAGORN THEY ARE PROUD AND WILFUL BUT THEY ARE TRUEHEARTED GENEROUS IN THOUGHT AND DEED BOLD BUT NOT CRUEL WISE BUT UNLEARNED WRITING NO BOOKS BUT SINGING MANY SONGS AFTER THE MANNER OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN BEFORE THE DARK YEARS BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE OF LATE NOR IN WHAT MIND THE ROHIRRIM MAY NOW BE BETWEEN THE TRAITOR SARUMAN AND THE THREAT OF SAURON THEY HAVE LONG BEEN THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE OF GONDOR THOUGH THEY ARE NOT AKIN TO THEM IT WAS IN FORGOTTEN YEARS LONG AGO THAT EORL THE YOUNG BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE NORTH AND THEIR KINSHIP IS RATHER WITH THE BARDINGS OF DALE AND WITH THE BEORNINGS OF THE WOOD AMONG WHOM MAY STILL BE SEEN MANY MEN TALL AND FAIR AS ARE THE RIDERS OF ROHAN AT LEAST THEY WILL NOT LOVE THE ORCS
BUT GANDALF SPOKE OF A RUMOUR THAT THEY PAY TRIBUTE TO MORDOR SAID GIMLI
I BELIEVE IT NO MORE THAN DID BOROMIR ANSWERED ARAGORN
YOU WILL SOON LEARN THE TRUTH SAID LEGOLAS ALREADY THEY APPROACH
AT LENGTH EVEN GIMLI COULD HEAR THE DISTANT BEAT OF GALLOPING HOOFS THE HORSEMEN FOLLOWING THE TRAIL HAD TURNED FROM THE RIVER AND WERE DRAWING NEAR THE DOWNS THEY WERE RIDING LIKE THE WIND
NOW THE CRIES OF CLEAR STRONG VOICES CAME RINGING OVER THE FIELDS SUDDENLY THEY SWEPT UP WITH A NOISE LIKE THUNDER AND THE FOREMOST HORSEMAN SWERVED PASSING BY THE FOOT OF THE HILL AND LEADING THE HOST BACK SOUTHWARD ALONG THE WESTERN SKIRTS OF THE DOWNS AFTER HIM THEY RODE A LONG LINE OF MAILCLAD MEN SWIFT SHINING FELL AND FAIR TO LOOK UPON
THEIR HORSES WERE OF GREAT STATURE STRONG AND CLEANLIMBED THEIR GREY COATS GLISTENED THEIR LONG TAILS FLOWED IN THE WIND THEIR MANES WERE BRAIDED ON THEIR PROUD NECKS THE MEN THAT RODE THEM MATCHED THEM WELL TALL AND LONGLIMBED THEIR HAIR FLAXENPALE FLOWED UNDER THEIR LIGHT HELMS AND STREAMED IN LONG BRAIDS BEHIND THEM THEIR FACES WERE STERN AND KEEN IN THEIR HANDS WERE TALL SPEARS OF ASH PAINTED SHIELDS WERE SLUNG AT THEIR BACKS LONG SWORDS WERE AT THEIR BELTS THEIR BURNISHED SKIRTS OF MAIL HUNG DOWN UPON THEIR KNEES
IN PAIRS THEY GALLOPED BY AND THOUGH EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE ROSE IN HIS STIRRUPS AND GAZED AHEAD AND TO EITHER SIDE THEY APPEARED NOT TO PERCEIVE THE THREE STRANGERS SITTING SILENTLY AND WATCHING THEM THE HOST HAD ALMOST PASSED WHEN SUDDENLY ARAGORN STOOD UP AND CALLED IN A LOUD VOICE
WHAT NEWS FROM THE NORTH RIDERS OF ROHAN
WITH ASTONISHING SPEED AND SKILL THEY CHECKED THEIR STEEDS WHEELED AND CAME CHARGING ROUND SOON THE THREE COMPANIONS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A RING OF HORSEMEN MOVING IN A RUNNING CIRCLE UP THE HILLSLOPE BEHIND THEM AND DOWN ROUND AND ROUND THEM AND DRAWING EVER INWARDS ARAGORN STOOD SILENT AND THE OTHER TWO SAT WITHOUT MOVING WONDERING WHAT WAY THINGS WOULD TURN
WITHOUT A WORD OR CRY SUDDENLY THE RIDERS HALTED A THICKET OF SPEARS WERE POINTED TOWARDS THE STRANGERS AND SOME OF THE HORSEMEN HAD BOWS IN HAND AND THEIR ARROWS WERE ALREADY FITTED TO THE STRING THEN ONE RODE FORWARD A TALL MAN TALLER THAN ALL THE REST FROM HIS HELM AS A CREST A WHITE HORSETAIL FLOWED HE ADVANCED UNTIL THE POINT OF HIS SPEAR WAS WITHIN A FOOT OF ARAGORNS BREAST ARAGORN DID NOT STIR
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS LAND SAID THE RIDER USING THE COMMON SPEECH OF THE WEST IN MANNER AND TONE LIKE TO THE SPEECH OF BOROMIR MAN OF GONDOR
I AM CALLED STRIDER ANSWERED ARAGORN I CAME OUT OF THE NORTH I AM HUNTING ORCS
THE RIDER LEAPED FROM HIS HORSE GIVING HIS SPEAR TO ANOTHER WHO RODE UP AND DISMOUNTED AT HIS SIDE HE DREW HIS SWORD AND STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH ARAGORN SURVEYING HIM KEENLY AND NOT WITHOUT WONDER AT LENGTH HE SPOKE AGAIN
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT YOU YOURSELVES WERE ORCS HE SAID BUT NOW I SEE THAT IT IS NOT SO INDEED YOU KNOW LITTLE OF ORCS IF YOU GO HUNTING THEM IN THIS FASHION THEY WERE SWIFT AND WELLARMED AND THEY WERE MANY YOU WOULD HAVE CHANGED FROM HUNTERS TO PREY IF EVER YOU HAD OVERTAKEN THEM BUT THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT YOU STRIDER HE BENT HIS CLEAR BRIGHT EYES AGAIN UPON THE RANGER THAT IS NO NAME FOR A MAN THAT YOU GIVE AND STRANGE TOO IS YOUR RAIMENT HAVE YOU SPRUNG OUT OF THE GRASS HOW DID YOU ESCAPE OUR SIGHT ARE YOU ELVISH FOLK
NO SAID ARAGORN ONE ONLY OF US IS AN ELF LEGOLAS FROM THE WOODLAND REALM IN DISTANT MIRKWOOD BUT WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH LOTHLORIEN AND THE GIFTS AND FAVOUR OF THE LADY GO WITH US
THE RIDER LOOKED AT THEM WITH RENEWED WONDER BUT HIS EYES HARDENED THEN THERE IS A LADY IN THE GOLDEN WOOD AS OLD TALES TELL HE SAID FEW ESCAPE HER NETS THEY SAY THESE ARE STRANGE DAYS BUT IF YOU HAVE HER FAVOUR THEN YOU ALSO ARE NETWEAVERS AND SORCERERS MAYBE HE TURNED A COLD GLANCE SUDDENLY UPON LEGOLAS AND GIMLI WHY DO YOU NOT SPEAK SILENT ONES HE DEMANDED
GIMLI ROSE AND PLANTED HIS FEET FIRMLY APART HIS HAND GRIPPED THE HANDLE OF HIS AXE AND HIS DARK EYES FLASHED GIVE ME YOUR NAME HORSEMASTER AND I WILL GIVE YOU MINE AND MORE BESIDES HE SAID
AS FOR THAT SAID THE RIDER STARING DOWN AT THE DWARF THE STRANGER SHOULD DECLARE HIMSELF FIRST YET I AM NAMED EOMER SON OF EOMUND AND AM CALLED THE THIRD MARSHAL OF RIDDERMARK
THEN EOMER SON OF EOMUND THIRD MARSHAL OF RIDDERMARK LET GIMLI THE DWARF GLOINS SON WARN YOU AGAINST FOOLISH WORDS YOU SPEAK EVIL OF THAT WHICH IS FAIR BEYOND THE REACH OF YOUR THOUGHT AND ONLY LITTLE WIT CAN EXCUSE YOU
EOMERS EYES BLAZED AND THE MEN OF ROHAN MURMURED ANGRILY AND CLOSED IN ADVANCING THEIR SPEARS I WOULD CUT OFF YOUR HEAD BEARD AND ALL MASTER DWARF IF IT STOOD BUT A LITTLE HIGHER FROM THE GROUND SAID EOMER
HE STANDS NOT ALONE SAID LEGOLAS BENDING HIS BOW AND FITTING AN ARROW WITH HANDS THAT MOVED QUICKER THAN SIGHT YOU WOULD DIE BEFORE YOUR STROKE FELL
EOMER RAISED HIS SWORD AND THINGS MIGHT HAVE GONE ILL BUT ARAGORN SPRANG BETWEEN THEM AND RAISED HIS HAND YOUR PARDON EOMER HE CRIED WHEN YOU KNOW MORE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE ANGERED MY COMPANIONS WE INTEND NO EVIL TO ROHAN NOR TO ANY OF ITS FOLK NEITHER TO MAN NOR TO HORSE WILL YOU NOT HEAR OUR TALE BEFORE YOU STRIKE
I WILL SAID EOMER LOWERING HIS BLADE BUT WANDERERS IN THE RIDDERMARK WOULD BE WISE TO BE LESS HAUGHTY IN THESE DAYS OF DOUBT FIRST TELL ME YOUR RIGHT NAME
FIRST TELL ME WHOM YOU SERVE SAID ARAGORN ARE YOU FRIEND OR FOE OF SAURON THE DARK LORD OF MORDOR
I SERVE ONLY THE LORD OF THE MARK THEODEN KING SON OF THENGEL ANSWERED EOMER WE DO NOT SERVE THE POWER OF THE BLACK LAND FAR AWAY BUT NEITHER ARE WE YET AT OPEN WAR WITH HIM AND IF YOU ARE FLEEING FROM HIM THEN YOU HAD BEST LEAVE THIS LAND THERE IS TROUBLE NOW ON ALL OUR BORDERS AND WE ARE THREATENED BUT WE DESIRE ONLY TO BE FREE AND TO LIVE AS WE HAVE LIVED KEEPING OUR OWN AND SERVING NO FOREIGN LORD GOOD OR EVIL WE WELCOMED GUESTS KINDLY IN THE BETTER DAYS BUT IN THESE TIMES THE UNBIDDEN STRANGER FINDS US SWIFT AND HARD COME WHO ARE YOU WHOM DO YOU SERVE AT WHOSE COMMAND DO YOU HUNT ORCS IN OUR LAND
I SERVE NO MAN SAID ARAGORN BUT THE SERVANTS OF SAURON I PURSUE INTO WHATEVER LAND THEY MAY GO THERE ARE FEW AMONG MORTAL MEN WHO KNOW MORE OF ORCS AND I DO NOT HUNT THEM IN THIS FASHION OUT OF CHOICE THE ORCS WHOM WE PURSUED TOOK CAPTIVE TWO OF MY FRIENDS IN SUCH NEED A MAN THAT HAS NO HORSE WILL GO ON FOOT AND HE WILL NOT ASK FOR LEAVE TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL NOR WILL HE COUNT THE HEADS OF THE ENEMY SAVE WITH A SWORD I AM NOT WEAPONLESS
ARAGORN THREW BACK HIS CLOAK THE ELVENSHEATH GLITTERED AS HE GRASPED IT AND THE BRIGHT BLADE OF ANDURIL SHONE LIKE A SUDDEN FLAME AS HE SWEPT IT OUT ELENDIL HE CRIED I AM ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN AND AM CALLED ELESSAR THE ELFSTONE DUNADAN THE HEIR OF ISILDUR ELENDILS SON OF GONDOR HERE IS THE SWORD THAT WAS BROKEN AND IS FORGED AGAIN WILL YOU AID ME OR THWART ME CHOOSE SWIFTLY
GIMLI AND LEGOLAS LOOKED AT THEIR COMPANION IN AMAZEMENT FOR THEY HAD NOT SEEN HIM IN THIS MOOD BEFORE HE SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN IN STATURE WHILE EOMER HAD SHRUNK AND IN HIS LIVING FACE THEY CAUGHT A BRIEF VISION OF THE POWER AND MAJESTY OF THE KINGS OF STONE FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED TO THE EYES OF LEGOLAS THAT A WHITE FLAME FLICKERED ON THE BROWS OF ARAGORN LIKE A SHINING CROWN
EOMER STEPPED BACK AND A LOOK OF AWE WAS IN HIS FACE HE CAST DOWN HIS PROUD EYES THESE ARE INDEED STRANGE DAYS HE MUTTERED DREAMS AND LEGENDS SPRING TO LIFE OUT OF THE GRASS
TELL ME LORD HE SAID WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE AND WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THE DARK WORDS LONG HAS BOROMIR SON OF DENETHOR BEEN GONE SEEKING AN ANSWER AND THE HORSE THAT WE LENT HIM CAME BACK RIDERLESS WHAT DOOM DO YOU BRING OUT OF THE NORTH
THE DOOM OF CHOICE SAID ARAGORN YOU MAY SAY THIS TO THEODEN SON OF THENGEL OPEN WAR LIES BEFORE HIM WITH SAURON OR AGAINST HIM NONE MAY LIVE NOW AS THEY HAVE LIVED AND FEW SHALL KEEP WHAT THEY CALL THEIR OWN BUT OF THESE GREAT MATTERS WE WILL SPEAK LATER IF CHANCE ALLOWS I WILL COME MYSELF TO THE KING NOW I AM IN GREAT NEED AND I ASK FOR HELP OR AT LEAST FOR TIDINGS YOU HEARD THAT WE ARE PURSUING AN ORCHOST THAT CARRIED OFF OUR FRIENDS WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
THAT YOU NEED NOT PURSUE THEM FURTHER SAID EOMER THE ORCS ARE DESTROYED
AND OUR FRIENDS
WE FOUND NONE BUT ORCS
BUT THAT IS STRANGE INDEED SAID ARAGORN DID YOU SEARCH THE SLAIN WERE THERE NO BODIES OTHER THAN THOSE OF ORCKIND THEY WOULD BE SMALL ONLY CHILDREN TO YOUR EYES UNSHOD BUT CLAD IN GREY
THERE WERE NO DWARVES NOR CHILDREN SAID EOMER WE COUNTED ALL THE SLAIN AND DESPOILED THEM AND THEN WE PILED THE CARCASES AND BURNED THEM AS IS OUR CUSTOM THE ASHES ARE SMOKING STILL
WE DO NOT SPEAK OF DWARVES OR CHILDREN SAID GIMLI OUR FRIENDS WERE HOBBITS
HOBBITS SAID EOMER AND WHAT MAY THEY BE IT IS A STRANGE NAME
A STRANGE NAME FOR A STRANGE FOLK SAID GIMLI BUT THESE WERE VERY DEAR TO US IT SEEMS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD IN ROHAN OF THE WORDS THAT TROUBLED MINAS TIRITH THEY SPOKE OF THE HALFLING THESE HOBBITS ARE HALFLINGS
HALFLINGS LAUGHED THE RIDER THAT STOOD BESIDE EOMER HALFLINGS BUT THEY ARE ONLY A LITTLE PEOPLE IN OLD SONGS AND CHILDRENS TALES OUT OF THE NORTH DO WE WALK IN LEGENDS OR ON THE GREEN EARTH IN THE DAYLIGHT
A MAN MAY DO BOTH SAID ARAGORN FOR NOT WE BUT THOSE WHO COME AFTER WILL MAKE THE LEGENDS OF OUR TIME THE GREEN EARTH SAY YOU THAT IS A MIGHTY MATTER OF LEGEND THOUGH YOU TREAD IT UNDER THE LIGHT OF DAY
TIME IS PRESSING SAID THE RIDER NOT HEEDING ARAGORN WE MUST HASTEN SOUTH LORD LET US LEAVE THESE WILD FOLK TO THEIR FANCIES OR LET US BIND THEM AND TAKE THEM TO THE KING
PEACE EOTHAIN SAID EOMER IN HIS OWN TONGUE LEAVE ME A WHILE TELL THE EORED TO ASSEMBLE ON THE PATH AND MAKE READY TO RIDE TO THE ENTWADE
MUTTERING EOTHAIN RETIRED AND SPOKE TO THE OTHERS SOON THEY DREW OFF AND LEFT EOMER ALONE WITH THE THREE COMPANIONS
ALL THAT YOU SAY IS STRANGE ARAGORN HE SAID YET YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH THAT IS PLAIN THE MEN OF THE MARK DO NOT LIE AND THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT EASILY DECEIVED BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ALL WILL YOU NOT NOW SPEAK MORE FULLY OF YOUR ERRAND SO THAT I MAY JUDGE WHAT TO DO
I SET OUT FROM IMLADRIS AS IT IS NAMED IN THE RHYME MANY WEEKS AGO ANSWERED ARAGORN WITH ME WENT BOROMIR OF MINAS TIRITH MY ERRAND WAS TO GO TO THAT CITY WITH THE SON OF DENETHOR TO AID HIS FOLK IN THEIR WAR AGAINST SAURON BUT THE COMPANY THAT I JOURNEYED WITH HAD OTHER BUSINESS OF THAT I CANNOT SPEAK NOW GANDALF THE GREY WAS OUR LEADER
GANDALF EOMER EXCLAIMED GANDALF GREYHAME IS KNOWN IN THE MARK BUT HIS NAME I WARN YOU IS NO LONGER A PASSWORD TO THE KINGS FAVOUR HE HAS BEEN A GUEST IN THE LAND MANY TIMES IN THE MEMORY OF MEN COMING AS HE WILL AFTER A SEASON OR AFTER MANY YEARS HE IS EVER THE HERALD OF STRANGE EVENTS A BRINGER OF EVIL SOME NOW SAY
INDEED SINCE HIS LAST COMING IN THE SUMMER ALL THINGS HAVE GONE AMISS AT THAT TIME OUR TROUBLE WITH SARUMAN BEGAN UNTIL THEN WE COUNTED SARUMAN OUR FRIEND BUT GANDALF CAME THEN AND WARNED US THAT SUDDEN WAR WAS PREPARING IN ISENGARD HE SAID THAT HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN ORTHANC AND HAD HARDLY ESCAPED AND HE BEGGED FOR HELP BUT THEODEN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND HE WENT AWAY SPEAK NOT THE NAME OF GANDALF LOUDLY IN THEODENS EARS HE IS WROTH FOR GANDALF TOOK THE HORSE THAT IS CALLED SHADOWFAX THE MOST PRECIOUS OF ALL THE KINGS STEEDS CHIEF OF THE MEARAS WHICH ONLY THE LORD OF THE MARK MAY RIDE FOR THE SIRE OF THEIR RACE WAS THE GREAT HORSE OF EORL THAT KNEW THE SPEECH OF MEN SEVEN NIGHTS AGO SHADOWFAX RETURNED BUT THE KINGS ANGER IS NOT LESS FOR NOW THE HORSE IS WILD AND WILL LET NO MAN HANDLE HIM
THEN SHADOWFAX HAS FOUND HIS WAY ALONE FROM THE FAR NORTH SAID ARAGORN FOR IT WAS THERE THAT HE AND GANDALF PARTED BUT ALAS GANDALF WILL RIDE NO LONGER HE FELL INTO DARKNESS IN THE MINES OF MORIA AND COMES NOT AGAIN
THAT IS HEAVY TIDINGS SAID EOMER AT LEAST TO ME AND TO MANY THOUGH NOT TO ALL AS YOU MAY FIND IF YOU COME TO THE KING
IT IS TIDINGS MORE GRIEVOUS THAN ANY IN THIS LAND CAN UNDERSTAND THOUGH IT MAY TOUCH THEM SORELY ERE THE YEAR IS MUCH OLDER SAID ARAGORN BUT WHEN THE GREAT FALL THE LESS MUST LEAD MY PART IT HAS BEEN TO GUIDE OUR COMPANY ON THE LONG ROAD FROM MORIA THROUGH LORIEN WE CAME  OF WHICH IT WERE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD LEARN THE TRUTH ERE YOU SPEAK OF IT AGAIN  AND THENCE DOWN THE LEAGUES OF THE GREAT RIVER TO THE FALLS OF RAUROS THERE BOROMIR WAS SLAIN BY THE SAME ORCS WHOM YOU DESTROYED
YOUR NEWS IS ALL OF WOE CRIED EOMER IN DISMAY GREAT HARM IS THIS DEATH TO MINAS TIRITH AND TO US ALL THAT WAS A WORTHY MAN ALL SPOKE HIS PRAISE HE CAME SELDOM TO THE MARK FOR HE WAS EVER IN THE WARS ON THE EASTBORDERS BUT I HAVE SEEN HIM MORE LIKE TO THE SWIFT SONS OF EORL THAN TO THE GRAVE MEN OF GONDOR HE SEEMED TO ME AND LIKELY TO PROVE A GREAT CAPTAIN OF HIS PEOPLE WHEN HIS TIME CAME BUT WE HAVE HAD NO WORD OF THIS GRIEF OUT OF GONDOR WHEN DID HE FALL
IT IS NOW THE FOURTH DAY SINCE HE WAS SLAIN ANSWERED ARAGORN AND SINCE THE EVENING OF THAT DAY WE HAVE JOURNEYED FROM THE SHADOW OF TOL BRANDIR
ON FOOT CRIED EOMER
YES EVEN AS YOU SEE US
WIDE WONDER CAME INTO EOMERS EYES STRIDER IS TOO POOR A NAME SON OF ARATHORN HE SAID WINGFOOT I NAME YOU THIS DEED OF THE THREE FRIENDS SHOULD BE SUNG IN MANY A HALL FORTY LEAGUES AND FIVE YOU HAVE MEASURED ERE THE FOURTH DAY IS ENDED HARDY IS THE RACE OF ELENDIL
BUT NOW LORD WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO I MUST RETURN IN HASTE TO THEODEN I SPOKE WARILY BEFORE MY MEN IT IS TRUE THAT WE ARE NOT YET AT OPEN WAR WITH THE BLACK LAND AND THERE ARE SOME CLOSE TO THE KINGS EAR THAT SPEAK CRAVEN COUNSELS BUT WAR IS COMING WE SHALL NOT FORSAKE OUR OLD ALLIANCE WITH GONDOR AND WHILE THEY FIGHT WE SHALL AID THEM SO SAY I AND ALL WHO HOLD WITH ME THE EASTMARK IS MY CHARGE THE WARD OF THE THIRD MARSHAL AND I HAVE REMOVED ALL OUR HERDS AND HERDFOLK WITHDRAWING THEM BEYOND ENTWASH AND LEAVING NONE HERE BUT GUARDS AND SWIFT SCOUTS
THEN YOU DO NOT PAY TRIBUTE TO SAURON SAID GIMLI
WE DO NOT AND WE NEVER HAVE SAID EOMER WITH A FLASH OF HIS EYES THOUGH IT COMES TO MY EARS THAT THAT LIE HAS BEEN TOLD SOME YEARS AGO THE LORD OF THE BLACK LAND WISHED TO PURCHASE HORSES OF US AT GREAT PRICE BUT WE REFUSED HIM FOR HE PUTS BEASTS TO EVIL USE THEN HE SENT PLUNDERING ORCS AND THEY CARRY OFF WHAT THEY CAN CHOOSING ALWAYS THE BLACK HORSES FEW OF THESE ARE NOW LEFT FOR THAT REASON OUR FEUD WITH THE ORCS IS BITTER
BUT AT THIS TIME OUR CHIEF CONCERN IS WITH SARUMAN HE HAS CLAIMED LORDSHIP OVER ALL THIS LAND AND THERE HAS BEEN WAR BETWEEN US FOR MANY MONTHS HE HAS TAKEN ORCS INTO HIS SERVICE AND WOLFRIDERS AND EVIL MEN AND HE HAS CLOSED THE GAP AGAINST US SO THAT WE ARE LIKELY TO BE BESET BOTH EAST AND WEST
IT IS ILL DEALING WITH SUCH A FOE HE IS A WIZARD BOTH CUNNING AND DWIMMERCRAFTY HAVING MANY GUISES HE WALKS HERE AND THERE THEY SAY AS AN OLD MAN HOODED AND CLOAKED VERY LIKE TO GANDALF AS MANY NOW RECALL HIS SPIES SLIP THROUGH EVERY NET AND HIS BIRDS OF ILL OMEN ARE ABROAD IN THE SKY I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT WILL ALL END AND MY HEART MISGIVES ME FOR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HIS FRIENDS DO NOT ALL DWELL IN ISENGARD BUT IF YOU COME TO THE KINGS HOUSE YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF WILL YOU NOT COME DO I HOPE IN VAIN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SENT TO ME FOR A HELP IN DOUBT AND NEED
I WILL COME WHEN I MAY SAID ARAGORN
COME NOW SAID EOMER THE HEIR OF ELENDIL WOULD BE A STRENGTH INDEED TO THE SONS OF EORL IN THIS EVIL TIDE THERE IS BATTLE EVEN NOW UPON THE WESTEMNET AND I FEAR THAT IT MAY GO ILL FOR US
INDEED IN THIS RIDING NORTH I WENT WITHOUT THE KINGS LEAVE FOR IN MY ABSENCE HIS HOUSE IS LEFT WITH LITTLE GUARD BUT SCOUTS WARNED ME OF THE ORCHOST COMING DOWN OUT OF THE EAST WALL THREE NIGHTS AGO AND AMONG THEM THEY REPORTED THAT SOME BORE THE WHITE BADGES OF SARUMAN SO SUSPECTING WHAT I MOST FEAR A LEAGUE BETWEEN ORTHANC AND THE DARK TOWER I LED FORTH MY EORED MEN OF MY OWN HOUSEHOLD AND WE OVERTOOK THE ORCS AT NIGHTFALL TWO DAYS AGO NEAR TO THE BORDERS OF THE ENTWOOD THERE WE SURROUNDED THEM AND GAVE BATTLE YESTERDAY AT DAWN FIFTEEN OF MY MEN I LOST AND TWELVE HORSES ALAS FOR THE ORCS WERE GREATER IN NUMBER THAN WE COUNTED ON OTHERS JOINED THEM COMING OUT OF THE EAST ACROSS THE GREAT RIVER THEIR TRAIL IS PLAIN TO SEE A LITTLE NORTH OF THIS SPOT AND OTHERS TOO CAME OUT OF THE FOREST GREAT ORCS WHO ALSO BORE THE WHITE HAND OF ISENGARD THAT KIND IS STRONGER AND MORE FELL THAN ALL OTHERS
NONETHELESS WE PUT AN END TO THEM BUT WE HAVE BEEN TOO LONG AWAY WE ARE NEEDED SOUTH AND WEST WILL YOU NOT COME THERE ARE SPARE HORSES AS YOU SEE THERE IS WORK FOR THE SWORD TO DO YES AND WE COULD FIND A USE FOR GIMLIS AXE AND THE BOW OF LEGOLAS IF THEY WILL PARDON MY RASH WORDS CONCERNING THE LADY OF THE WOOD I SPOKE ONLY AS DO ALL MEN IN MY LAND AND I WOULD GLADLY LEARN BETTER
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR FAIR WORDS SAID ARAGORN AND MY HEART DESIRES TO COME WITH YOU BUT I CANNOT DESERT MY FRIENDS WHILE HOPE REMAINS
HOPE DOES NOT REMAIN SAID EOMER YOU WILL NOT FIND YOUR FRIENDS ON THE NORTHBORDERS
YET MY FRIENDS ARE NOT BEHIND WE FOUND A CLEAR TOKEN NOT FAR FROM THE EAST WALL THAT ONE AT LEAST OF THEM WAS STILL ALIVE THERE BUT BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE DOWNS WE HAVE FOUND NO OTHER TRACE OF THEM AND NO TRAIL HAS TURNED ASIDE THIS WAY OR THAT UNLESS MY SKILL HAS WHOLLY LEFT ME
THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS BECOME OF THEM
I DO NOT KNOW THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SLAIN AND BURNED AMONG THE ORCS BUT THAT YOU WILL SAY CANNOT BE AND I DO NOT FEAR IT I CAN ONLY THINK THAT THEY WERE CARRIED OFF INTO THE FOREST BEFORE THE BATTLE EVEN BEFORE YOU ENCIRCLED YOUR FOES MAYBE CAN YOU SWEAR THAT NONE ESCAPED YOUR NET IN SUCH A WAY
I WOULD SWEAR THAT NO ORC ESCAPED AFTER WE SIGHTED THEM SAID EOMER WE REACHED THE FORESTEAVES BEFORE THEM AND IF AFTER THAT ANY LIVING THING BROKE THROUGH OUR RING THEN IT WAS NO ORC AND HAD SOME ELVISH POWER
OUR FRIENDS WERE ATTIRED EVEN AS WE ARE SAID ARAGORN AND YOU PASSED US BY UNDER THE FULL LIGHT OF DAY
I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID EOMER IT IS HARD TO BE SURE OF ANYTHING AMONG SO MANY MARVELS THE WORLD IS ALL GROWN STRANGE ELF AND DWARF IN COMPANY WALK IN OUR DAILY FIELDS AND FOLK SPEAK WITH THE LADY OF THE WOOD AND YET LIVE AND THE SWORD COMES BACK TO WAR THAT WAS BROKEN IN THE LONG AGES ERE THE FATHERS OF OUR FATHERS RODE INTO THE MARK HOW SHALL A MAN JUDGE WHAT TO DO IN SUCH TIMES
AS HE EVER HAS JUDGED SAID ARAGORN GOOD AND ILL HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE YESTERYEAR NOR ARE THEY ONE THING AMONG ELVES AND DWARVES AND ANOTHER AMONG MEN IT IS A MANS PART TO DISCERN THEM AS MUCH IN THE GOLDEN WOOD AS IN HIS OWN HOUSE
TRUE INDEED SAID EOMER BUT I DO NOT DOUBT YOU NOR THE DEED WHICH MY HEART WOULD DO YET I AM NOT FREE TO DO ALL AS I WOULD IT IS AGAINST OUR LAW TO LET STRANGERS WANDER AT WILL IN OUR LAND UNTIL THE KING HIMSELF SHALL GIVE THEM LEAVE AND MORE STRICT IS THE COMMAND IN THESE DAYS OF PERIL I HAVE BEGGED YOU TO COME BACK WILLINGLY WITH ME AND YOU WILL NOT LOTH AM I TO BEGIN A BATTLE OF ONE HUNDRED AGAINST THREE
I DO NOT THINK YOUR LAW WAS MADE FOR SUCH A CHANCE SAID ARAGORN NOR INDEED AM I A STRANGER FOR I HAVE BEEN IN THIS LAND BEFORE MORE THAN ONCE AND RIDDEN WITH THE HOST OF THE ROHIRRIM THOUGH UNDER OTHER NAME AND IN OTHER GUISE YOU I HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE FOR YOU ARE YOUNG BUT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH EOMUND YOUR FATHER AND WITH THEODEN SON OF THENGEL NEVER IN FORMER DAYS WOULD ANY HIGH LORD OF THIS LAND HAVE CONSTRAINED A MAN TO ABANDON SUCH A QUEST AS MINE MY DUTY AT LEAST IS CLEAR TO GO ON COME NOW SON OF EOMUND THE CHOICE MUST BE MADE AT LAST AID US OR AT THE WORST LET US GO FREE OR SEEK TO CARRY OUT YOUR LAW IF YOU DO SO THERE WILL BE FEWER TO RETURN TO YOUR WAR OR TO YOUR KING
EOMER WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT THEN HE SPOKE WE BOTH HAVE NEED OF HASTE HE SAID MY COMPANY CHAFES TO BE AWAY AND EVERY HOUR LESSENS YOUR HOPE THIS IS MY CHOICE YOU MAY GO AND WHAT IS MORE I WILL LEND YOU HORSES THIS ONLY I ASK WHEN YOUR QUEST IS ACHIEVED OR IS PROVED VAIN RETURN WITH THE HORSES OVER THE ENTWADE TO MEDUSELD THE HIGH HOUSE IN EDORAS WHERE THEODEN NOW SITS THUS YOU SHALL PROVE TO HIM THAT I HAVE NOT MISJUDGED IN THIS I PLACE MYSELF AND MAYBE MY VERY LIFE IN THE KEEPING OF YOUR GOOD FAITH DO NOT FAIL
I WILL NOT SAID ARAGORN
THERE WAS GREAT WONDER AND MANY DARK AND DOUBTFUL GLANCES AMONG HIS MEN WHEN EOMER GAVE ORDERS THAT THE SPARE HORSES WERE TO BE LENT TO THE STRANGERS BUT ONLY EOTHAIN DARED TO SPEAK OPENLY
IT MAY BE WELL ENOUGH FOR THIS LORD OF THE RACE OF GONDOR AS HE CLAIMS HE SAID BUT WHO HAS HEARD OF A HORSE OF THE MARK BEING GIVEN TO A DWARF
NO ONE SAID GIMLI AND DO NOT TROUBLE NO ONE WILL EVER HEAR OF IT I WOULD SOONER WALK THAN SIT ON THE BACK OF ANY BEAST SO GREAT FREE OR BEGRUDGED
BUT YOU MUST RIDE NOW OR YOU WILL HINDER US SAID ARAGORN
COME YOU SHALL SIT BEHIND ME FRIEND GIMLI SAID LEGOLAS THEN ALL WILL BE WELL AND YOU NEED NEITHER BORROW A HORSE NOR BE TROUBLED BY ONE
A GREAT DARKGREY HORSE WAS BROUGHT TO ARAGORN AND HE MOUNTED IT HASUFEL IS HIS NAME SAID EOMER MAY HE BEAR YOU WELL AND TO BETTER FORTUNE THAN GARULF HIS LATE MASTER
A SMALLER AND LIGHTER HORSE BUT RESTIVE AND FIERY WAS BROUGHT TO LEGOLAS AROD WAS HIS NAME BUT LEGOLAS ASKED THEM TO TAKE OFF SADDLE AND REIN I NEED THEM NOT HE SAID AND LEAPED LIGHTLY UP AND TO THEIR WONDER AROD WAS TAME AND WILLING BENEATH HIM MOVING HERE AND THERE WITH BUT A SPOKEN WORD SUCH WAS THE ELVISH WAY WITH ALL GOOD BEASTS GIMLI WAS LIFTED UP BEHIND HIS FRIEND AND HE CLUNG TO HIM NOT MUCH MORE AT EASE THAN SAM GAMGEE IN A BOAT
FAREWELL AND MAY YOU FIND WHAT YOU SEEK CRIED EOMER RETURN WITH WHAT SPEED YOU MAY AND LET OUR SWORDS HEREAFTER SHINE TOGETHER
I WILL COME SAID ARAGORN
AND I WILL COME TOO SAID GIMLI THE MATTER OF THE LADY GALADRIEL LIES STILL BETWEEN US I HAVE YET TO TEACH YOU GENTLE SPEECH 
WE SHALL SEE SAID EOMER SO MANY STRANGE THINGS HAVE CHANCED THAT TO LEARN THE PRAISE OF A FAIR LADY UNDER THE LOVING STROKES OF A DWARFS AXE WILL SEEM NO GREAT WONDER FAREWELL
WITH THAT THEY PARTED VERY SWIFT WERE THE HORSES OF ROHAN WHEN AFTER A LITTLE GIMLI LOOKED BACK THE COMPANY OF EOMER WERE ALREADY SMALL AND FAR AWAY ARAGORN DID NOT LOOK BACK HE WAS WATCHING THE TRAIL AS THEY SPED ON THEIR WAY BENDING LOW WITH HIS HEAD BESIDE THE NECK OF HASUFEL BEFORE LONG THEY CAME TO THE BORDERS OF THE ENTWASH AND THERE THEY MET THE OTHER TRAIL OF WHICH EOMER HAD SPOKEN COMING DOWN FROM THE EAST OUT OF THE WOLD
ARAGORN DISMOUNTED AND SURVEYED THE GROUND THEN LEAPING BACK INTO THE SADDLE HE RODE AWAY FOR SOME DISTANCE EASTWARD KEEPING TO ONE SIDE AND TAKING CARE NOT TO OVERRIDE THE FOOTPRINTS THEN HE AGAIN DISMOUNTED AND EXAMINED THE GROUND GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON FOOT
THERE IS LITTLE TO DISCOVER HE SAID WHEN HE RETURNED THE MAIN TRAIL IS ALL CONFUSED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE HORSEMEN AS THEY CAME BACK THEIR OUTWARD COURSE MUST HAVE LAIN NEARER THE RIVER BUT THIS EASTWARD TRAIL IS FRESH AND CLEAR THERE IS NO SIGN THERE OF ANY FEET GOING THE OTHER WAY BACK TOWARDS ANDUIN NOW WE MUST RIDE SLOWER AND MAKE SURE THAT NO TRACE OR FOOTSTEP BRANCHES OFF ON EITHER SIDE THE ORCS MUST HAVE BEEN AWARE FROM THIS POINT THAT THEY WERE PURSUED THEY MAY HAVE MADE SOME ATTEMPT TO GET THEIR CAPTIVES AWAY BEFORE THEY WERE OVERTAKEN
AS THEY RODE FORWARD THE DAY WAS OVERCAST LOW GREY CLOUDS CAME OVER THE WOLD A MIST SHROUDED THE SUN EVER NEARER THE TREECLAD SLOPES OF FANGORN LOOMED SLOWLY DARKLING AS THE SUN WENT WEST THEY SAW NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIL TO RIGHT OR LEFT BUT HERE AND THERE THEY PASSED SINGLE ORCS FALLEN IN THEIR TRACKS AS THEY RAN WITH GREYFEATHERED ARROWS STICKING IN BACK OR THROAT
AT LAST AS THE AFTERNOON WAS WANING THEY CAME TO THE EAVES OF THE FOREST AND IN AN OPEN GLADE AMONG THE FIRST TREES THEY FOUND THE PLACE OF THE GREAT BURNING THE ASHES WERE STILL HOT AND SMOKING BESIDE IT WAS A GREAT PILE OF HELMS AND MAIL CLOVEN SHIELDS AND BROKEN SWORDS BOWS AND DARTS AND OTHER GEAR OF WAR UPON A STAKE IN THE MIDDLE WAS SET A GREAT GOBLIN HEAD UPON ITS SHATTERED HELM THE WHITE BADGE COULD STILL BE SEEN FURTHER AWAY NOT FAR FROM THE RIVER WHERE IT CAME STREAMING OUT FROM THE EDGE OF THE WOOD THERE WAS A MOUND IT WAS NEWLY RAISED THE RAW EARTH WAS COVERED WITH FRESHCUT TURVES ABOUT IT WERE PLANTED FIFTEEN SPEARS
ARAGORN AND HIS COMPANIONS SEARCHED FAR AND WIDE ABOUT THE FIELD OF BATTLE BUT THE LIGHT FADED AND EVENING SOON DREW DOWN DIM AND MISTY BY NIGHTFALL THEY HAD DISCOVERED NO TRACE OF MERRY AND PIPPIN
WE CAN DO NO MORE SAID GIMLI SADLY WE HAVE BEEN SET MANY RIDDLES SINCE WE CAME TO TOL BRANDIR BUT THIS IS THE HARDEST TO UNRAVEL I WOULD GUESS THAT THE BURNED BONES OF THE HOBBITS ARE NOW MINGLED WITH THE ORCS IT WILL BE HARD NEWS FOR FRODO IF HE LIVES TO HEAR IT AND HARD TOO FOR THE OLD HOBBIT WHO WAITS IN RIVENDELL ELROND WAS AGAINST THEIR COMING
BUT GANDALF WAS NOT SAID LEGOLAS
BUT GANDALF CHOSE TO COME HIMSELF AND HE WAS THE FIRST TO BE LOST ANSWERED GIMLI HIS FORESIGHT FAILED HIM
THE COUNSEL OF GANDALF WAS NOT FOUNDED ON FOREKNOWLEDGE OF SAFETY FOR HIMSELF OR FOR OTHERS SAID ARAGORN THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT IT IS BETTER TO BEGIN THAN TO REFUSE EVEN THOUGH THE END MAY BE DARK BUT I SHALL NOT DEPART FROM THIS PLACE YET IN ANY CASE WE MUST HERE AWAIT THE MORNINGLIGHT
A LITTLE WAY BEYOND THE BATTLEFIELD THEY MADE THEIR CAMP UNDER A SPREADING TREE IT LOOKED LIKE A CHESTNUT AND YET IT STILL BORE MANY BROAD BROWN LEAVES OF A FORMER YEAR LIKE DRY HANDS WITH LONG SPLAYED FINGERS THEY RATTLED MOURNFULLY IN THE NIGHTBREEZE
GIMLI SHIVERED THEY HAD BROUGHT ONLY ONE BLANKET APIECE LET US LIGHT A FIRE HE SAID I CARE NO LONGER FOR THE DANGER LET THE ORCS COME AS THICK AS SUMMERMOTHS ROUND A CANDLE
IF THOSE UNHAPPY HOBBITS ARE ASTRAY IN THE WOODS IT MIGHT DRAW THEM HITHER SAID LEGOLAS
AND IT MIGHT DRAW OTHER THINGS NEITHER ORC NOR HOBBIT SAID ARAGORN WE ARE NEAR TO THE MOUNTAINMARCHES OF THE TRAITOR SARUMAN ALSO WE ARE ON THE VERY EDGE OF FANGORN AND IT IS PERILOUS TO TOUCH THE TREES OF THAT WOOD IT IS SAID
BUT THE ROHIRRIM MADE A GREAT BURNING HERE YESTERDAY SAID GIMLI AND THEY FELLED TREES FOR THE FIRE AS CAN BE SEEN YET THEY PASSED THE NIGHT AFTER SAFELY HERE WHEN THEIR LABOUR WAS ENDED
THEY WERE MANY SAID ARAGORN AND THEY DO NOT HEED THE WRATH OF FANGORN FOR THEY COME HERE SELDOM AND THEY DO NOT GO UNDER THE TREES BUT OUR PATHS ARE LIKELY TO LEAD US INTO THE VERY FOREST ITSELF SO HAVE A CARE CUT NO LIVING WOOD
THERE IS NO NEED SAID GIMLI THE RIDERS HAVE LEFT CHIP AND BOUGH ENOUGH AND THERE IS DEAD WOOD LYING IN PLENTY HE WENT OFF TO GATHER FUEL AND BUSIED HIMSELF WITH BUILDING AND KINDLING A FIRE BUT ARAGORN SAT SILENT WITH HIS BACK TO THE GREAT TREE DEEP IN THOUGHT AND LEGOLAS STOOD ALONE IN THE OPEN LOOKING TOWARDS THE PROFOUND SHADOW OF THE WOOD LEANING FORWARD AS ONE WHO LISTENS TO VOICES CALLING FROM A DISTANCE
WHEN THE DWARF HAD A SMALL BRIGHT BLAZE GOING THE THREE COMPANIONS DREW CLOSE TO IT AND SAT TOGETHER SHROUDING THE LIGHT WITH THEIR HOODED FORMS LEGOLAS LOOKED UP AT THE BOUGHS OF THE TREE REACHING OUT ABOVE THEM
LOOK HE SAID THE TREE IS GLAD OF THE FIRE
IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THE DANCING SHADOWS TRICKED THEIR EYES BUT CERTAINLY TO EACH OF THE COMPANIONS THE BOUGHS APPEARED TO BE BENDING THIS WAY AND THAT SO AS TO COME ABOVE THE FLAMES WHILE THE UPPER BRANCHES WERE STOOPING DOWN THE BROWN LEAVES NOW STOOD OUT STIFF AND RUBBED TOGETHER LIKE MANY COLD CRACKED HANDS TAKING COMFORT IN THE WARMTH
THERE WAS A SILENCE FOR SUDDENLY THE DARK AND UNKNOWN FOREST SO NEAR AT HAND MADE ITSELF FELT AS A GREAT BROODING PRESENCE FULL OF SECRET PURPOSE AFTER A WHILE LEGOLAS SPOKE AGAIN
CELEBORN WARNED US NOT TO GO FAR INTO FANGORN HE SAID DO YOU KNOW WHY ARAGORN WHAT ARE THE FABLES OF THE FOREST THAT BOROMIR HAD HEARD
I HAVE HEARD MANY TALES IN GONDOR AND ELSEWHERE SAID ARAGORN BUT IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE WORDS OF CELEBORN I SHOULD DEEM THEM ONLY FABLES THAT MEN HAVE MADE AS TRUE KNOWLEDGE FADES I HAD THOUGHT OF ASKING YOU WHAT WAS THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AND IF AN ELF OF THE WOOD DOES NOT KNOW HOW SHALL A MAN ANSWER
YOU HAVE JOURNEYED FURTHER THAN I SAID LEGOLAS I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF THIS IN MY OWN LAND SAVE ONLY SONGS THAT TELL HOW THE ONODRIM THAT MEN CALL ENTS DWELT THERE LONG AGO FOR FANGORN IS OLD OLD EVEN AS THE ELVES WOULD RECKON IT
YES IT IS OLD SAID ARAGORN AS OLD AS THE FOREST BY THE BARROWDOWNS AND IT IS FAR GREATER ELROND SAYS THAT THE TWO ARE AKIN THE LAST STRONGHOLDS OF THE MIGHTY WOODS OF THE ELDER DAYS IN WHICH THE FIRSTBORN ROAMED WHILE MEN STILL SLEPT YET FANGORN HOLDS SOME SECRET OF ITS OWN WHAT IT IS I DO NOT KNOW
AND I DO NOT WISH TO KNOW SAID GIMLI LET NOTHING THAT DWELLS IN FANGORN BE TROUBLED ON MY ACCOUNT
THEY NOW DREW LOTS FOR THE WATCHES AND THE LOT FOR THE FIRST WATCH FELL TO GIMLI THE OTHERS LAY DOWN ALMOST AT ONCE SLEEP LAID HOLD ON THEM GIMLI SAID ARAGORN DROWSILY REMEMBER IT IS PERILOUS TO CUT BOUGH OR TWIG FROM A LIVING TREE IN FANGORN BUT DO NOT STRAY FAR IN SEARCH OF DEAD WOOD LET THE FIRE DIE RATHER CALL ME AT NEED
WITH THAT HE FELL ASLEEP LEGOLAS ALREADY LAY MOTIONLESS HIS FAIR HANDS FOLDED UPON HIS BREAST HIS EYES UNCLOSED BLENDING LIVING NIGHT AND DEEP DREAM AS IS THE WAY WITH ELVES GIMLI SAT HUNCHED BY THE FIRE RUNNING HIS THUMB THOUGHTFULLY ALONG THE EDGE OF HIS AXE THE TREE RUSTLED THERE WAS NO OTHER SOUND
SUDDENLY GIMLI LOOKED UP AND THERE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE FIRELIGHT STOOD AN OLD BENT MAN LEANING ON A STAFF AND WRAPPED IN A GREAT CLOAK HIS WIDEBRIMMED HAT WAS PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EYES GIMLI SPRANG UP TOO AMAZED FOR THE MOMENT TO CRY OUT THOUGH AT ONCE THE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO HIS MIND THAT SARUMAN HAD CAUGHT THEM BOTH ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS ROUSED BY HIS SUDDEN MOVEMENT SAT UP AND STARED THE OLD MAN DID NOT SPEAK OR MAKE SIGN
WELL FATHER WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU SAID ARAGORN LEAPING TO HIS FEET COME AND BE WARM IF YOU ARE COLD HE STRODE FORWARD BUT THE OLD MAN WAS GONE THERE WAS NO TRACE OF HIM TO BE FOUND NEAR AT HAND AND THEY DID NOT DARE TO WANDER FAR THE MOON HAD SET AND THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK
SUDDENLY LEGOLAS GAVE A CRY THE HORSES THE HORSES
THE HORSES WERE GONE THEY HAD DRAGGED THEIR PICKETS AND DISAPPEARED FOR ME TIME THE THREE COMPANIONS STOOD STILL AND SILENT TROUBLED BY THIS NEW STROKE OF ILL FORTUNE THEY WERE UNDER THE EAVES OF FANGORN AND ENDLESS LEAGUES LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE MEN OF ROHAN THEIR ONLY FRIENDS IN THIS WIDE AND DANGEROUS LAND AS THEY STOOD IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEY HEARD FAR OFF IN THE NIGHT THE SOUND OF HORSES WHINNYING AND NEIGHING THEN ALL WAS QUIET AGAIN EXCEPT FOR THE COLD RUSTLE OF THE WIND
WELL THEY ARE GONE SAID ARAGORN AT LAST WE CANNOT FIND THEM OR CATCH THEM SO THAT IF THEY DO NOT RETURN OF THEIR OWN WILL WE MUST DO WITHOUT WE STARTED ON OUR FEET AND WE HAVE THOSE STILL
FEET SAID GIMLI BUT WE CANNOT EAT THEM AS WELL AS WALK ON THEM HE THREW SOME FUEL ON THE FIRE AND SLUMPED DOWN BESIDE IT
ONLY A FEW HOURS AGO YOU WERE UNWILLING TO SIT ON A HORSE OF ROHAN LAUGHED LEGOLAS YOU WILL MAKE A RIDER YET
IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT I SHALL HAVE THE CHANCE SAID GIMLI
IF YOU WISH TO KNOW WHAT I THINK HE BEGAN AGAIN AFTER A WHILE I THINK IT WAS SARUMAN WHO ELSE REMEMBER THE WORDS OF EOMER HE WALKS ABOUT LIKE AN OLD MAN HOODED AND CLOAKED THOSE WERE THE WORDS HE HAS GONE OFF WITH OUR HORSES OR SCARED THEM AWAY AND HERE WE ARE THERE IS MORE TROUBLE COMING TO US MARK MY WORDS
I MARK THEM SAID ARAGORN BUT I MARKED ALSO THAT THIS OLD MAN HAD A HAT NOT A HOOD STILL I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU GUESS RIGHT AND THAT WE ARE IN PERIL HERE BY NIGHT OR DAY YET IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO BUT REST WHILE WE MAY I WILL WATCH FOR A WHILE NOW GIMLI I HAVE MORE NEED OF THOUGHT THAN OF SLEEP
THE NIGHT PASSED SLOWLY LEGOLAS FOLLOWED ARAGORN AND GIMLI FOLLOWED LEGOLAS AND THEIR WATCHES WORE AWAY BUT NOTHING HAPPENED THE OLD MAN DID NOT APPEAR AGAIN AND THE HORSES DID NOT RETURN



CHAPTER 3
THE URUKHAI

PIPPIN LAY IN A DARK AND TROUBLED DREAM IT SEEMED THAT HE COULD HEAR HIS OWN SMALL VOICE ECHOING IN BLACK TUNNELS CALLING FRODO FRODO BUT INSTEAD OF FRODO HUNDREDS OF HIDEOUS ORCFACES GRINNED AT HIM OUT OF THE SHADOWS HUNDREDS OF HIDEOUS ARMS GRASPED AT HIM FROM EVERY SIDE WHERE WAS MERRY
HE WOKE COLD AIR BLEW ON HIS FACE HE WAS LYING ON HIS BACK EVENING WAS COMING AND THE SKY ABOVE WAS GROWING DIM HE TURNED AND FOUND THAT THE DREAM WAS LITTLE WORSE THAN THE WAKING HIS WRISTS LEGS AND ANKLES WERE TIED WITH CORDS BESIDE HIM MERRY LAY WHITEFACED WITH A DIRTY RAG BOUND ACROSS HIS BROWS ALL ABOUT THEM SAT OR STOOD A GREAT COMPANY OF ORCS
SLOWLY IN PIPPINS ACHING HEAD MEMORY PIECED ITSELF TOGETHER AND BECAME SEPARATED FROM DREAMSHADOWS OF COURSE HE AND MERRY HAD RUN OFF INTO THE WOODS WHAT HAD COME OVER THEM WHY HAD THEY DASHED OFF LIKE THAT TAKING NO NOTICE OF OLD STRIDER THEY HAD RUN A LONG WAY SHOUTING  HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HOW FAR OR HOW LONG AND THEN SUDDENLY THEY HAD CRASHED RIGHT INTO A GROUP OF ORCS THEY WERE STANDING LISTENING AND THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO SEE MERRY AND PIPPIN UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST IN THEIR ARMS THEN THEY YELLED AND DOZENS OF OTHER GOBLINS HAD SPRUNG OUT OF THE TREES MERRY AND HE HAD DRAWN THEIR SWORDS BUT THE ORCS DID NOT WISH TO FIGHT AND HAD TRIED ONLY TO LAY HOLD OF THEM EVEN WHEN MERRY HAD CUT OFF SEVERAL OF THEIR ARMS AND HANDS GOOD OLD MERRY
THEN BOROMIR HAD COME LEAPING THROUGH THE TREES HE HAD MADE THEM FIGHT HE SLEW MANY OF THEM AND THE REST FLED BUT THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR ON THE WAY BACK WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED AGAIN BY A HUNDRED ORCS AT LEAST SOME OF THEM VERY LARGE AND THEY SHOT A RAIN OF ARROWS ALWAYS AT BOROMIR BOROMIR HAD BLOWN HIS GREAT HORN TILL THE WOODS RANG AND AT FIRST THE ORCS HAD BEEN DISMAYED AND HAD DRAWN BACK BUT WHEN NO ANSWER BUT THE ECHOES CAME THEY HAD ATTACKED MORE FIERCE THAN EVER PIPPIN DID NOT REMEMBER MUCH MORE HIS LAST MEMO WAS OF BOROMIR LEANING AGAINST A TREE PLUCKING OUT AN ARROW THEN DARKNESS FELL SUDDENLY
I SUPPOSE I WAS KNOCKED ON THE HEAD HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WONDER IF POOR MERRY IS MUCH HURT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO BOROMIR WHY DIDNT THE ORCS KILL US WHERE ARE WE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING
HE COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS HE FELT COLD AND SICK I WISH GANDALF HAD NEVER PERSUADED ELROND TO LET US COME HE THOUGHT WHAT GOOD HAVE I BEEN JUST A NUISANCE A PASSENGER A PIECE OF LUGGAGE AND NOW I HAVE BEEN STOLEN AND I AM JUST A PIECE OF LUGGAGE FOR THE ORCS I HOPE STRIDER OR SOMEONE WILL COME AND CLAIM US BUT OUGHT I TO HOPE FOR IT WONT THAT THROW OUT ALL THE PLANS I WISH I COULD GET FREE
HE STRUGGLED A LITTLE QUITE USELESSLY ONE OF THE ORCS SITTING NEAR LAUGHED AND SAID SOMETHING TO A COMPANION IN THEIR ABOMINABLE TONGUE REST WHILE YOU CAN LITTLE FOOL HE SAID THEN TO PIPPIN IN THE COMMON SPEECH WHICH HE MADE ALMOST AS HIDEOUS AS HIS OWN LANGUAGE REST WHILE YOU CAN WELL FIND A USE FOR YOUR LEGS BEFORE LONG YOULL WISH YOU HAD GOT NONE BEFORE WE GET HOME
IF I HAD MY WAY YOUD WISH YOU WERE DEAD NOW SAID THE OTHER ID MAKE YOU SQUEAK YOU MISERABLE RAT HE STOOPED OVER PIPPIN BRINGING HIS YELLOW FANGS CLOSE TO HIS FACE HE HAD A BLACK KNIFE WITH A LONG JAGGED BLADE IN HIS HAND LIE QUIET OR ILL TICKLE YOU WITH THIS HE HISSED DONT DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF OR I MAY FORGET MY ORDERS CURSE THE ISENGARDERS UGLUK U BAGRONK SHA PUSHDUG SARUMANGLOB BUBHOSH SKAI HE PASSED INTO A LONG ANGRY SPEECH IN HIS OWN TONGUE THAT SLOWLY DIED AWAY INTO MUTTERING AND SNARLING
TERRIFIED PIPPIN LAY STILL THOUGH THE PAIN AT HIS WRISTS AND ANKLES WAS GROWING AND THE STONES BENEATH HIM WERE BORING INTO HIS BACK TO TAKE HIS MIND OFF HIMSELF HE LISTENED INTENTLY TO ALL THAT HE COULD HEAR THERE WERE MANY VOICES ROUND ABOUT AND THOUGH ORCSPEECH SOUNDED AT ALL TIMES FULL OF HATE AND ANGER IT SEEMED PLAIN THAT SOMETHING LIKE A QUARREL HAD BEGUN AND WAS GETTING HOTTER
TO PIPPINS SURPRISE HE FOUND THAT MUCH OF THE TALK WAS INTELLIGIBLE MANY OF THE ORCS WERE USING ORDINARY LANGUAGE APPARENTLY THE MEMBERS OF TWO OR THREE QUITE DIFFERENT TRIBES WERE PRESENT AND THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHERS ORCSPEECH THERE WAS AN ANGRY DEBATE CONCERNING WHAT THEY WERE TO DO NOW WHICH WAY THEY WERE TO TAKE AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE PRISONERS
THERES NO TIME TO KILL THEM PROPERLY SAID ONE NO TIME FOR PLAY ON THIS TRIP
THAT CANT BE HELPED SAID ANOTHER BUT WHY NOT KILL THEM QUICK KILL THEM NOW THEYRE A CURSED NUISANCE AND WERE IN A HURRY EVENINGS COMING ON AND WE OUGHT TO GET A MOVE ON

WHAT ARE THEY WANTED FOR ASKED SEVERAL VOICES WHY ALIVE DO THEY GIVE GOOD SPORT
NO I HEARD THAT ONE OF THEM HAS GOT SOMETHING SOMETHING THATS WANTED FOR THE WAR SOME ELVISH PLOT OR OTHER ANYWAY THEYLL BOTH BE QUESTIONED
IS THAT ALL YOU KNOW WHY DONT WE SEARCH THEM AND FIND OUT WE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING THAT WE COULD USE OURSELVES
THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING REMARK SNEERED A VOICE SOFTER THAN THE OTHERS BUT MORE EVIL I MAY HAVE TO REPORT THAT THE PRISONERS ARE NOT TO BE SEARCHED OR PLUNDERED THOSE ARE MY ORDERS
AND MINE TOO SAID THE DEEP VOICE ALIVE AND AS CAPTURED NO SPOILING THATS MY ORDERS
NOT OUR ORDERS SAID ONE OF THE EARLIER VOICES WE HAVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE MINES TO KILL AND AVENGE OUR FOLK I WISH TO KILL AND THEN GO BACK NORTH
THEN YOU CAN WISH AGAIN SAID THE GROWLING VOICE I AM UGLUK I COMMAND I RETURN TO ISENGARD BY THE SHORTEST ROAD
IS SARUMAN THE MASTER OR THE GREAT EYE SAID THE EVIL VOICE WE SHOULD GO BACK AT ONCE TO LUGBURZ
IF WE COULD CROSS THE GREAT RIVER WE MIGHT SAID ANOTHER VOICE BUT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH OF US TO VENTURE DOWN TO THE BRIDGES
I CAME ACROSS SAID THE EVIL VOICE A WINGED NAZGUL AWAITS US NORTHWARD ON THE EASTBANK
MAYBE MAYBE THEN YOULL FLY OFF WITH OUR PRISONERS AND GET ALL THE PAY AND PRAISE IN LUGBURZ AND LEAVE US TO FOOT IT AS BEST WE CAN THROUGH THE HORSECOUNTRY NO WE MUST STICK TOGETHER THESE LANDS ARE DANGEROUS FULL OF FOUL REBELS AND BRIGANDS

SWINE IS IT HOW DO YOU FOLK LIKE BEING CALLED SWINE BY THE MUCKRAKERS OF A DIRTY LITTLE WIZARD ITS ORCFLESH THEY EAT ILL WARRANT
MANY LOUD YELLS IN ORCSPEECH ANSWERED HIM AND THE RINGING CLASH OF WEAPONS BEING DRAWN CAUTIOUSLY PIPPIN ROLLED OVER HOPING TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HIS GUARDS HAD GONE TO JOIN IN THE FRAY IN THE TWILIGHT HE SAW A LARGE BLACK ORC PROBABLY UGLUK STANDING FACING GRISHNAKH A SHORT CROOKLEGGED CREATURE VERY BROAD AND WITH LONG ARMS THAT HUNG ALMOST TO THE GROUND ROUND THEM WERE MANY SMALLER GOBLINS PIPPIN SUPPOSED THAT THESE WERE THE ONES FROM THE NORTH THEY HAD DRAWN THEIR KNIVES AND SWORDS BUT HESITATED TO ATTACK UGLUK
UGLUK SHOUTED AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ORCS OF NEARLY HIS OWN SIZE RAN UP THEN SUDDENLY WITHOUT WARNING UGLUK SPRANG FORWARDS AND WITH TWO SWIFT STROKES SWEPT THE HEADS OFF TWO OF HIS OPPONENTS GRISHNAKH STEPPED ASIDE AND VANISHED INTO THE SHADOWS THE OTHERS GAVE WAY AND ONE STEPPED BACKWARDS AND FELL OVER MERRYS PROSTRATE FORM WITH A CURSE YET THAT PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE FOR UGLUKS FOLLOWERS LEAPED OVER HIM AND CUT DOWN ANOTHER WITH THEIR BROADBLADED SWORDS IT WAS THE YELLOWFANGED GUARD HIS BODY FELL RIGHT ON TOP OF PIPPIN STILL CLUTCHING ITS LONG SAWEDGED KNIFE
PUT UP YOUR WEAPONS SHOUTED UGLUK AND LETS HAVE NO MORE NONSENSE WE GO STRAIGHT WEST FROM HERE AND DOWN THE STAIR FROM THERE STRAIGHT TO THE DOWNS THEN ALONG THE RIVER TO THE FOREST AND WE MARCH DAY AND NIGHT THAT CLEAR
NOW THOUGHT PIPPIN IF ONLY IT TAKES THAT UGLY FELLOW A LITTLE WHILE TO GET HIS TROOP UNDER CONTROL IVE GOT A CHANCE A GLEAM OF HOPE HAD COME TO HIM THE EDGE OF THE BLACK KNIFE HAD SNICKED HIS ARM AND THEN SLID DOWN TO HIS WRIST HE FELT THE BLOOD TRICKLING ON TO HIS HAND BUT HE ALSO FELT THE COLD TOUCH OF STEEL AGAINST HIS SKIN
THE ORCS WERE GETTING READY TO MARCH AGAIN BUT SOME OF THE NORTHERNERS WERE STILL UNWILLING AND THE ISENGARDERS SLEW TWO MORE BEFORE THE REST WERE COWED THERE WAS MUCH CURSING AND CONFUSION FOR THE MOMENT PIPPIN WAS UNWATCHED HIS LEGS WERE SECURELY BOUND BUT HIS ARMS WERE ONLY TIED ABOUT THE WRISTS AND HIS HANDS WERE IN FRONT OF HIM HE COULD MOVE THEM BOTH TOGETHER THOUGH THE BONDS WERE CRUELLY TIGHT HE PUSHED THE DEAD ORC TO ONE SIDE THEN HARDLY DARING TO BREATHE HE DREW THE KNOT OF THE WRISTCORD UP AND DOWN AGAINST THE BLADE OF THE KNIFE IT WAS SHARP AND THE DEAD HAND HELD IT FAST THE CORD WAS CUT QUICKLY PIPPIN TOOK IT IN HIS FINGERS AND KNOTTED IT AGAIN INTO A LOOSE BRACELET OF TWO LOOPS AND SLIPPED IT OVER HIS HANDS THEN HE LAY VERY STILL
PICK UP THOSE PRISONERS SHOUTED UGLUK DONT PLAY ANY TRICKS WITH THEM IF THEY ARE NOT ALIVE WHEN WE GET BACK SOMEONE ELSE WILL DIE TOO
AN ORC SEIZED PIPPIN LIKE A SACK PUT ITS HEAD BETWEEN HIS TIED HANDS GRABBED HIS ARMS AND DRAGGED THEM DOWN UNTIL PIPPINS FACE WAS CRUSHED AGAINST ITS NECK THEN IT JOLTED OFF WITH HIM ANOTHER TREATED MERRY IN THE SAME WAY THE ORCS CLAWLIKE HAND GRIPPED PIPPINS ARMS LIKE IRON THE NAILS BIT INTO HIM HE SHUT HIS EYES AND SLIPPED BACK INTO EVIL DREAMS
SUDDENLY HE WAS THROWN ON TO THE STONY FLOOR AGAIN IT WAS EARLY NIGHT BUT THE SLIM MOON WAS ALREADY FALLING WESTWARD THEY WERE ON THE EDGE OF A CLIFF THAT SEEMED TO LOOK OUT OVER A SEA OF PALE MIST THERE WAS A SOUND OF WATER FALLING NEARBY
THE SCOUTS HAVE COME BACK AT LAST SAID AN ORC CLOSE AT HAND
WELL WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER GROWLED THE VOICE OF UGLUK
ONLY A SINGLE HORSEMAN AND HE MADE OFF WESTWARDS ALLS CLEAR NOW
NOW I DARESAY BUT HOW LONG YOU FOOLS YOU SHOULD HAVE SHOT HIM HELL RAISE THE ALARM THE CURSED HORSEBREEDERS WILL HEAR OF US BY MORNING NOW WELL HAVE TO LEG IT DOUBLE QUICK
A SHADOW BENT OVER PIPPIN IT WAS UGLUK SIT UP SAID THE ORC MY LADS ARE TIRED OF LUGGING YOU ABOUT WE HAVE GOT TO CLIMB DOWN AND YOU MUST USE YOUR LEGS BE HELPFUL NOW NO CRYING OUT NO TRYING TO ESCAPE WE HAVE WAYS OF PAYING FOR TRICKS THAT YOU WONT LIKE THOUGH THEY WONT SPOIL YOUR USEFULNESS FOR THE MASTER
HE CUT THE THONGS ROUND PIPPINS LEGS AND ANKLES PICKED HIM UP BY HIS HAIR AND STOOD HIM ON HIS FEET PIPPIN FELL DOWN AND UGLUK DRAGGED HIM UP BY HIS HAIR AGAIN SEVERAL ORCS LAUGHED UGLUK THRUST A FLASK BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND POURED SOME BURNING LIQUID DOWN HIS THROAT HE FELT A HOT FIERCE GLOW FLOW THROUGH HIM THE PAIN IN HIS LEGS AND ANKLES VANISHED HE COULD STAND
NOW FOR THE OTHER SAID UGLUK PIPPIN SAW HIM GO TO MERRY WHO WAS LYING CLOSE BY AND KICK HIM MERRY GROANED SEIZING HIM ROUGHLY UGLUK PULLED HIM INTO A SITTING POSITION AND TORE THE BANDAGE OFF HIS HEAD THEN HE SMEARED THE WOUND WITH SOME DARK STUFF OUT OF A SMALL WOODEN BOX MERRY CRIED OUT AND STRUGGLED WILDLY
THE ORCS CLAPPED AND HOOTED CANT TAKE HIS MEDICINE THEY JEERED DOESNT KNOW WHATS GOOD FOR HIM AI WE SHALL HAVE SOME FUN LATER
BUT AT THE MOMENT UGLUK WAS NOT ENGAGED IN SPORT HE NEEDED SPEED AND HAD TO HUMOUR UNWILLING FOLLOWERS HE WAS HEALING MERRY IN ORCFASHION AND HIS TREATMENT WORKED SWIFTLY WHEN HE HAD FORCED A DRINK FROM HIS FLASK DOWN THE HOBBITS THROAT CUT HIS LEGBONDS AND DRAGGED HIM TO HIS FEET MERRY STOOD UP LOOKING PALE BUT GRIM AND DEFIANT AND VERY MUCH ALIVE THE GASH IN HIS FOREHEAD GAVE HIM NO MORE TROUBLE BUT HE BORE A BROWN SCAR TO THE END OF HIS DAYS
HULLO PIPPIN HE SAID SO YOUVE COME ON THIS LITTLE EXPEDITION TOO WHERE DO WE GET BED AND BREAKFAST
NOW THEN SAID UGLUK NONE OF THAT HOLD YOUR TONGUES NO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER ANY TROUBLE WILL BE REPORTED AT THE OTHER END AND HELL KNOW HOW TO PAY YOU YOULL GET BED AND BREAKFAST ALL RIGHT MORE THAN YOU CAN STOMACH
THE ORCBAND BEGAN TO DESCEND A NARROW RAVINE LEADING DOWN INTO THE MISTY PLAIN BELOW MERRY AND PIPPIN SEPARATED BY A DOZEN ORCS OR MORE CLIMBED DOWN WITH THEM AT THE BOTTOM THEY STEPPED ON TO GRASS AND THE HEARTS OF THE HOBBITS ROSE
NOW STRAIGHT ON SHOUTED UGLUK WEST AND A LITTLE NORTH FOLLOW LUGDUSH
BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO AT SUNRISE SAID SOME OF THE NORTHERNERS
GO ON RUNNING SAID UGLUK WHAT DO YOU THINK SIT ON THE GRASS AND WAIT FOR THE WHITESKINS TO JOIN THE PICNIC
BUT WE CANT RUN IN THE SUNLIGHT
YOULL RUN WITH ME BEHIND YOU SAID UGLUK RUN OR YOULL NEVER SEE YOUR BELOVED HOLES AGAIN BY THE WHITE HAND WHATS THE USE OF SENDING OUT MOUNTAINMAGGOTS ON A TRIP ONLY HALF TRAINED RUN CURSE YOU RUN WHILE NIGHT LASTS
THEN THE WHOLE COMPANY BEGAN TO RUN WITH THE LONG LOPING STRIDES OF ORCS THEY KEPT NO ORDER THRUSTING JOSTLING AND CURSING YET THEIR SPEED WAS VERY GREAT EACH HOBBIT HAD A GUARD OF THREE PIPPIN WAS FAR BACK IN THE LINE HE WONDERED HOW LONG HE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO ON AT THIS PACE HE HAD HAD NO FOOD SINCE THE MORNING ONE OF HIS GUARDS HAD A WHIP BUT AT PRESENT THE ORCLIQUOR WAS STILL HOT IN HIM HIS WITS TOO WERE WIDE AWAKE
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN THERE CAME INTO HIS MIND UNBIDDEN A VISION OF THE KEEN FACE OF STRIDER BENDING OVER A DARK TRAIL AND RUNNING RUNNING BEHIND BUT WHAT COULD EVEN A RANGER SEE EXCEPT A CONFUSED TRAIL OF ORCFEET HIS OWN LITTLE PRINTS AND MERRYS WERE OVERWHELMED BY THE TRAMPLING OF THE IRONSHOD SHOES BEFORE THEM AND BEHIND THEM AND ABOUT THEM
THEY HAD GONE ONLY A MILE OR SO FROM THE CLIFF WHEN THE LAND SLOPED DOWN INTO A WIDE SHALLOW DEPRESSION WHERE THE GROUND WAS SOFT AND WET MIST LAY THERE PALEGLIMMERING IN THE LAST RAYS OF THE SICKLE MOON THE DARK SHAPES OF THE ORCS IN FRONT GREW DIM AND THEN WERE SWALLOWED UP
AI STEADY NOW SHOUTED UGLUK FROM THE REAR
A SUDDEN THOUGHT LEAPED INTO PIPPINS MIND AND HE ACTED ON IT AT ONCE HE SWERVED ASIDE TO THE RIGHT AND DIVED OUT OF THE REACH OF HIS CLUTCHING GUARD HEADFIRST INTO THE MIST HE LANDED SPRAWLING ON THE GRASS
HALT YELLED UGLUK
THERE WAS FOR A MOMENT TURMOIL AND CONFUSION PIPPIN SPRANG UP AND RAN BUT THE ORCS WERE AFTER HIM SOME SUDDENLY LOOMED UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM
NO HOPE OF ESCAPE THOUGHT PIPPIN BUT THERE IS A HOPE THAT I HAVE LEFT SOME OF MY OWN MARKS UNSPOILT ON THE WET GROUND HE GROPED WITH HIS TWO TIED HANDS AT HIS THROAT AND UNCLASPED THE BROOCH OF HIS CLOAK JUST AS LONG ARMS AND HARD CLAWS SEIZED HIM HE LET IT FALL THERE I SUPPOSE IT WILL LIE UNTIL THE END OF TIME HE THOUGHT I DONT KNOW WHY I DID IT IF THE OTHERS HAVE ESCAPED THEYVE PROBABLY ALL GONE WITH FRODO
A WHIPTHONG CURLED ROUND HIS LEGS AND HE STIFLED A CRY
ENOUGH SHOUTED UGLUK RUNNING UP HES STILL GOT TO RUN A LONG WAY YET MAKE EM BOTH RUN JUST USE THE WHIP AS A REMINDER
BUT THATS NOT ALL HE SNARLED TURNING TO PIPPIN I SHANT FORGET PAYMENT IS ONLY PUT OFF LEG IT
NEITHER PIPPIN NOR MERRY REMEMBERED MUCH OF THE LATER PART OF THE JOURNEY EVIL DREAMS AND EVIL WAKING WERE BLENDED INTO A LONG TUNNEL OF MISERY WITH HOPE GROWING EVER FAINTER BEHIND THEY RAN AND THEY RAN STRIVING TO KEEP UP THE PACE SET BY THE ORCS LICKED EVERY NOW AND AGAIN WITH A CRUEL THONG CUNNINGLY HANDLED IF THEY HALTED OR STUMBLED THEY WERE SEIZED AND DRAGGED FOR SOME DISTANCE
THE WARMTH OF THE ORCDRAUGHT HAD GONE PIPPIN FELT COLD AND SICK AGAIN SUDDENLY HE FELL FACE DOWNWARD ON THE TURF HARD HANDS WITH RENDING NAILS GRIPPED AND LIFTED HIM HE WAS CARRIED LIKE A SACK ONCE MORE AND DARKNESS GREW ABOUT HIM WHETHER THE DARKNESS OF ANOTHER NIGHT OR A BLINDNESS OF HIS EYES HE COULD NOT TELL
DIMLY HE BECAME AWARE OF VOICES CLAMOURING IT SEEMED THAT MANY OF THE ORCS WERE DEMANDING A HALT UGLUK WAS SHOUTING HE FELT HIMSELF FLUNG TO THE GROUND AND HE LAY AS HE FELL TILL BLACK DREAMS TOOK HIM BUT HE DID NOT LONG ESCAPE FROM PAIN SOON THE IRON GRIP OF MERCILESS HANDS WAS ON HIM AGAIN FOR A LONG TIME HE WAS TOSSED AND SHAKEN AND THEN SLOWLY THE DARKNESS GAVE WAY AND HE CAME BACK TO THE WAKING WORLD AND FOUND THAT IT WAS MORNING ORDERS WERE SHOUTED AND HE WAS THROWN ROUGHLY ON THE GRASS
THERE HE LAY FOR A WHILE FIGHTING WITH DESPAIR HIS HEAD SWAM BUT FROM THE HEAT IN HIS BODY HE GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN GIVEN ANOTHER DRAUGHT AN ORC STOOPED OVER HIM AND FLUNG HIM SOME BREAD AND A STRIP OF RAW DRIED FLESH HE ATE THE STALE GREY BREAD HUNGRILY BUT NOT THE MEAT HE WAS FAMISHED BUT NOT YET SO FAMISHED AS TO EAT FLESH FLUNG TO HIM BY AN ORC THE FLESH OF HE DARED NOT GUESS WHAT CREATURE
HE SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT MERRY WAS NOT FAR AWAY THEY WERE BY THE BANKS OF A SWIFT NARROW RIVER AHEAD MOUNTAINS LOOMED A TALL PEAK WAS CATCHING THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN A DARK SMUDGE OF FOREST LAY ON THE LOWER SLOPES BEFORE THEM
THERE WAS MUCH SHOUTING AND DEBATING AMONG THE ORCS A QUARREL SEEMED ON THE POINT OF BREAKING OUT AGAIN BETWEEN THE NORTHERNERS AND THE ISENGARDERS SOME WERE POINTING BACK AWAY SOUTH AND SOME WERE POINTING EASTWARD
VERY WELL SAID UGLUK LEAVE THEM TO ME THEN NO KILLING AS IVE TOLD YOU BEFORE BUT IF YOU WANT TO THROW AWAY WHAT WEVE COME ALL THE WAY TO GET THROW IT AWAY ILL LOOK AFTER IT LET THE FIGHTING URUKHAI DO THE WORK AS USUAL IF YOURE AFRAID OF THE WHITESKINS RUN RUN THERES THE FOREST HE SHOUTED POINTING AHEAD GET TO IT ITS YOUR BEST HOPE OFF YOU GO AND QUICK BEFORE I KNOCK A FEW MORE HEADS OFF TO PUT SOME SENSE INTO THE OTHERS
THERE WAS SOME CURSING AND SCUFFLING AND THEN MOST OF THE NORTHERNERS BROKE AWAY AND DASHED OFF OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM RUNNING WILDLY ALONG THE RIVER TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS THE HOBBITS WERE LEFT WITH THE ISENGARDERS A GRIM DARK BAND FOUR SCORE AT LEAST OF LARGE SWART SLANTEYED ORCS WITH GREAT BOWS AND SHORT BROADBLADED SWORDS A FEW OF THE LARGER AND BOLDER NORTHERNERS REMAINED WITH THEM
NOW WELL DEAL WITH GRISHNAKH SAID UGLUK BUT SOME EVEN OF HIS OWN FOLLOWERS WERE LOOKING UNEASILY SOUTHWARDS
I KNOW GROWLED UGLUK THE CURSED HORSEBOYS HAVE GOT WIND OF US BUT THATS ALL YOUR FAULT SNAGA YOU AND THE OTHER SCOUTS OUGHT TO HAVE YOUR EARS CUT OFF BUT WE ARE THE FIGHTERS WELL FEAST ON HORSEFLESH YET OR SOMETHING BETTER
AT THAT MOMENT PIPPIN SAW WHY SOME OF THE TROOP HAD BEEN POINTING EASTWARD FROM THAT DIRECTION THERE NOW CAME HOARSE CRIES AND THERE WAS GRISHNAKH AGAIN AND AT HIS BACK A COUPLE OF SCORE OF OTHERS LIKE HIM LONGARMED CROOKLEGGED ORCS THEY HAD A RED EYE PAINTED ON THEIR SHIELDS UGLUK STEPPED FORWARD TO MEET THEM SO YOUVE COME BACK HE SAID THOUGHT BETTER OF IT EH
IVE RETURNED TO SEE THAT ORDERS ARE CARRIED OUT AND THE PRISONERS SAFE ANSWERED GRISHNAKH
INDEED SAID UGLUK WASTE OF EFFORT ILL SEE THAT ORDERS ARE CARRIED OUT IN MY COMMAND AND WHAT ELSE DID YOU COME BACK FOR YOU WENT IN A HURRY DID YOU LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND
I LEFT A FOOL SNARLED GRISHNAKH BUT THERE WERE SOME STOUT FELLOWS WITH HIM THAT ARE TOO GOOD TO LOSE I KNEW YOUD LEAD THEM INTO A MESS IVE COME TO HELP THEM
SPLENDID LAUGHED UGLUK BUT UNLESS YOUVE GOT SOME GUTS FOR FIGHTING YOUVE TAKEN THE WRONG WAY LUGBURZ WAS YOUR ROAD THE WHITESKINS ARE COMING WHATS HAPPENED TO YOUR PRECIOUS NAZGUL HAS HE HAD ANOTHER MOUNT SHOT UNDER HIM NOW IF YOUD BROUGHT HIM ALONG THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN USEFUL  IF THESE NAZGUL ARE ALL THEY MAKE OUT
NAZGUL NAZGUL SAID GRISHNAKH SHIVERING AND LICKING HIS LIPS AS IF THE WORD HAD A FOUL TASTE THAT HE SAVOURED PAINFULLY YOU SPEAK OF WHAT IS DEEP BEYOND THE REACH OF YOUR MUDDY DREAMS UGLUK HE SAID NAZGUL AH ALL THAT THEY MAKE OUT ONE DAY YOULL WISH THAT YOU HAD NOT SAID THAT APE HE SNARLED FIERCELY YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEYRE THE APPLE OF THE GREAT EYE BUT THE WINGED NAZGUL NOT YET NOT YET HE WONT LET THEM SHOW THEMSELVES ACROSS THE GREAT RIVER YET NOT TOO SOON THEYRE FOR THE WAR  AND OTHER PURPOSES
YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT SAID UGLUK MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR YOU I GUESS PERHAPS THOSE IN LUGBURZ MIGHT WONDER HOW AND WHY BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE URUKHAI OF ISENGARD CAN DO THE DIRTY WORK AS USUAL DONT STAND SLAVERING THERE GET YOUR RABBLE TOGETHER THE OTHER SWINE ARE LEGGING IT TO THE FOREST YOUD BETTER FOLLOW YOU WOULDNT GET BACK TO THE GREAT RIVER ALIVE RIGHT OFF THE MARK NOW ILL BE ON YOUR HEELS
THE ISENGARDERS SEIZED MERRY AND PIPPIN AGAIN AND SLUNG THEM ON THEIR BACKS THEN THE TROOP STARTED OFF HOUR AFTER HOUR THEY RAN PAUSING NOW AND AGAIN ONLY TO SLING THE HOBBITS TO FRESH CARRIERS EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE QUICKER AND HARDIER OR BECAUSE OF SOME PLAN OF GRISHNAKHS THE ISENGARDERS GRADUALLY PASSED THROUGH THE ORCS OF MORDOR AND GRISHNAKHS FOLK CLOSED IN BEHIND SOON THEY WERE GAINING ALSO ON THE NORTHERNERS AHEAD THE FOREST BEGAN TO DRAW NEARER
PIPPIN WAS BRUISED AND TORN HIS ACHING HEAD WAS GRATED BY THE FILTHY JOWL AND HAIRY EAR OF THE ORC THAT HELD HIM IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT WERE BOWED BACKS AND TOUGH THICK LEGS GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN UNRESTING AS IF THEY WERE MADE OF WIRE AND HORN BEATING OUT THE NIGHTMARE SECONDS OF AN ENDLESS TIME
IN THE AFTERNOON UGLUKS TROOP OVERTOOK THE NORTHERNERS THEY WERE FLAGGING IN THE RAYS OF THE BRIGHT SUN WINTER SUN SHINING IN A PALE COOL SKY THOUGH IT WAS THEIR HEADS WERE DOWN AND THEIR TONGUES LOLLING OUT
MAGGOTS JEERED THE ISENGARDERS YOURE COOKED THE WHITESKINS WILL CATCH YOU AND EAT YOU THEYRE COMING
A CRY FROM GRISHNAKH SHOWED THAT THIS WAS NOT MERE JEST HORSEMEN RIDING VERY SWIFTLY HAD INDEED BEEN SIGHTED STILL FAR BEHIND BUT GAINING ON THE ORCS GAINING ON THEM LIKE A TIDE OVER THE FLATS ON FOLK STRAYING IN A QUICKSAND
THE ISENGARDERS BEGAN TO RUN WITH A REDOUBLED PACE THAT ASTONISHED PIPPIN A TERRIFIC SPURT IT SEEMED FOR THE END OF A RACE THEN HE SAW THAT THE SUN WAS SINKING FALLING BEHIND THE MISTY MOUNTAINS SHADOWS REACHED OVER THE LAND THE SOLDIERS OF MORDOR LIFTED THEIR HEADS AND ALSO BEGAN TO PUT ON SPEED THE FOREST WAS DARK AND CLOSE ALREADY THEY HAD PASSED A FEW OUTLYING TREES THE LAND WAS BEGINNING TO SLOPE UPWARDS EVER MORE STEEPLY BUT THE ORCS DID NOT HALT BOTH UGLUK AND GRISHNAKH SHOUTED SPURRING THEM ON TO A LAST EFFORT
THEY WILL MAKE IT YET THEY WILL ESCAPE THOUGHT PIPPIN AND THEN HE MANAGED TO TWIST HIS NECK SO AS TO GLANCE BACK WITH ONE EYE OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW THAT RIDERS AWAY EASTWARD WERE ALREADY LEVEL WITH THE ORCS GALLOPING OVER THE PLAIN THE SUNSET GILDED THEIR SPEARS AND HELMETS AND GLINTED IN THEIR PALE FLOWING HAIR THEY WERE HEMMING THE ORCS IN PREVENTING THEM FROM SCATTERING AND DRIVING THEM ALONG THE LINE OF THE RIVER
HE WONDERED VERY MUCH WHAT KIND OF FOLK THEY WERE HE WISHED NOW THAT HE HAD LEARNED MORE IN RIVENDELL AND LOOKED MORE AT MAPS AND THINGS BUT IN THOSE DAYS THE PLANS FOR THE JOURNEY SEEMED TO BE IN MORE COMPETENT HANDS AND HE HAD NEVER RECKONED WITH BEING CUT OFF FROM GANDALF OR FROM STRIDER AND EVEN FROM FRODO ALL THAT HE COULD REMEMBER ABOUT ROHAN WAS THAT GANDALFS HORSE SHADOWFAX HAD COME FROM THAT LAND THAT SOUNDED HOPEFUL AS FAR AS IT WENT
BUT HOW WILL THEY KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT ORCS HE THOUGHT I DONT SUPPOSE THEYVE EVER HEARD OF HOBBITS DOWN HERE I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GLAD THAT THE BEASTLY ORCS LOOK LIKE BEING DESTROYED BUT I WOULD RATHER BE SAVED MYSELF THE CHANCES WERE THAT HE AND MERRY WOULD BE KILLED TOGETHER WITH THEIR CAPTORS BEFORE EVER THE MEN OF ROHAN WERE AWARE OF THEM
A FEW OF THE RIDERS APPEARED TO BE BOWMEN SKILLED AT SHOOTING FROM A RUNNING HORSE RIDING SWIFTLY INTO RANGE THEY SHOT ARROWS AT THE ORCS THAT STRAGGLED BEHIND AND SEVERAL OF THEM FELL THEN THE RIDERS WHEELED AWAY OUT OF THE RANGE OF THE ANSWERING BOWS OF THEIR ENEMIES WHO SHOT WILDLY NOT DARING TO HALT THIS HAPPENED MANY TIMES AND ON ONE OCCASION ARROWS FELL AMONG THE ISENGARDERS ONE OF THEM JUST IN FRONT OF PIPPIN STUMBLED AND DID NOT GET UP AGAIN
NIGHT CAME DOWN WITHOUT THE RIDERS CLOSING IN FOR BATTLE MANY ORCS HAD FALLEN BUT FULLY TWO HUNDRED REMAINED IN THE EARLY DARKNESS THE ORCS CAME TO A HILLOCK THE EAVES OF THE FOREST WERE VERY NEAR PROBABLY NO MORE THAN THREE FURLONGS AWAY BUT THEY COULD GO NO FURTHER THE HORSEMEN HAD ENCIRCLED THEM A SMALL BAND DISOBEYED UGLUKS COMMAND AND RAN ON TOWARDS THE FOREST ONLY THREE RETURNED
WELL HERE WE ARE SNEERED GRISHNAKH FINE LEADERSHIP I HOPE THE GREAT UGLUK WILL LEAD US OUT AGAIN
PUT THOSE HALFLINGS DOWN ORDERED UGLUK TAKING NO NOTICE OF GRISHNAKH YOU LUGDUSH GET TWO OTHERS AND STAND GUARD OVER THEM THEYRE NOT TO BE KILLED UNLESS THE FILTHY WHITESKINS BREAK THROUGH UNDERSTAND AS LONG AS IM ALIVE I WANT EM BUT THEYRE NOT TO CRY OUT AND THEYRE NOT TO BE RESCUED BIND THEIR LEGS
THE LAST PART OF THE ORDER WAS CARRIED OUT MERCILESSLY BUT PIPPIN FOUND THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WAS CLOSE TO MERRY THE ORCS WERE MAKING A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE SHOUTING AND CLASHING THEIR WEAPONS AND THE HOBBITS MANAGED TO WHISPER TOGETHER FOR A WHILE
I DONT THINK MUCH OF THIS SAID MERRY I FEEL NEARLY DONE IN DONT THINK I COULD CRAWL AWAY FAR EVEN IF I WAS FREE
LEMBAS WHISPERED PIPPIN LEMBAS IVE GOT SOME HAVE YOU I DONT THINK THEYVE TAKEN ANYTHING BUT OUR SWORDS
YES I HAD A PACKET IN MY POCKET ANSWERED MERRY BUT IT MUST BE BATTERED TO CRUMBS ANYWAY I CANT PUT MY MOUTH IN MY POCKET
YOU WONT HAVE TO IVE BUT JUST THEN A SAVAGE KICK WARNED PIPPIN THAT THE NOISE HAD DIED DOWN AND THE GUARDS WERE WATCHFUL
THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND STILL ALL ROUND THE KNOLL ON WHICH THE ORCS WERE GATHERED LITTLE WATCHFIRES SPRANG UP GOLDENRED IN THE DARKNESS A COMPLETE RING OF THEM THEY WERE WITHIN A LONG BOWSHOT BUT THE RIDERS DID NOT SHOW THEMSELVES AGAINST THE LIGHT AND THE ORCS WASTED MANY ARROWS SHOOTING AT THE FIRES UNTIL UGLUK STOPPED THEM THE RIDERS MADE NO SOUND LATER IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE MOON CAME OUT OF THE MIST THEN OCCASIONALLY THEY COULD BE SEEN SHADOWY SHAPES THAT GLINTED NOW AND AGAIN IN THE WHITE LIGHT AS THEY MOVED IN CEASELESS PATROL
THEYLL WAIT FOR THE SUN CURSE THEM GROWLED ONE OF THE GUARDS WHY DONT WE GET TOGETHER AND CHARGE THROUGH WHATS OLD UGLUK THINK HES DOING I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
I DARESAY YOU WOULD SNARLED UGLUK STEPPING UP FROM BEHIND MEANING I DONT THINK AT ALL EH CURSE YOU YOURE AS BAD AS THE OTHER RABBLE THE MAGGOTS AND THE APES OF LUGBURZ NO GOOD TRYING TO CHARGE WITH THEM THEYD JUST SQUEAL AND BOLT AND THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THESE FILTHY HORSEBOYS TO MOP UP OUR LOT ON THE FLAT
THERES ONLY ONE THING THOSE MAGGOTS CAN DO THEY CAN SEE LIKE GIMLETS IN THE DARK BUT THESE WHITESKINS HAVE BETTER NIGHTEYES THAN MOST MEN FROM ALL IVE HEARD AND DONT FORGET THEIR HORSES THEY CAN SEE THE NIGHTBREEZE OR SO ITS SAID STILL THERES ONE THING THE FINE FELLOWS DONT KNOW MAUHUR AND HIS LADS ARE IN THE FOREST AND THEY SHOULD TURN UP ANY TIME NOW
UGLUKS WORDS WERE ENOUGH APPARENTLY TO SATISFY THE ISENGARDERS BUT THE OTHER ORCS WERE BOTH DISPIRITED AND REBELLIOUS THEY POSTED A FEW WATCHERS BUT MOST OF THEM LAY ON THE GROUND RESTING IN THE PLEASANT DARKNESS IT DID INDEED BECOME VERY DARK AGAIN FOR THE MOON PASSED WESTWARD INTO THICK CLOUD AND PIPPIN COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING A FEW FEET AWAY THE FIRES BROUGHT NO LIGHT TO THE HILLOCK THE RIDERS WERE NOT HOWEVER CONTENT MERELY TO WAIT FOR THE DAWN AND LET THEIR ENEMIES REST A SUDDEN OUTCRY ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE KNOLL SHOWED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG IT SEEMED THAT SOME OF THE MEN HAD RIDDEN IN CLOSE SLIPPED OFF THEIR HORSES CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE CAMP AND KILLED SEVERAL ORCS AND THEN HAD FADED AWAY AGAIN UGLUK DASHED OFF TO STOP A STAMPEDE
PIPPIN AND MERRY SAT UP THEIR GUARDS ISENGARDERS HAD GONE WITH UGLUK BUT IF THE HOBBITS HAD ANY THOUGHT OF ESCAPE IT WAS SOON DASHED A LONG HAIRY ARM TOOK EACH OF THEM BY THE NECK AND DREW THEM CLOSE TOGETHER DIMLY THEY WERE AWARE OF GRISHNAKHS GREAT HEAD AND HIDEOUS FACE BETWEEN THEM HIS FOUL BREATH WAS ON THEIR CHEEKS HE BEGAN TO PAW THEM AND FEEL THEM PIPPIN SHUDDERED AS HARD COLD FINGERS GROPED DOWN HIS BACK
WELL MY LITTLE ONES SAID GRISHNAKH IN A SOFT WHISPER ENJOYING YOUR NICE REST OR NOT A LITTLE AWKWARDLY PLACED PERHAPS SWORDS AND WHIPS ON ONE SIDE AND NASTY SPEARS ON THE OTHER LITTLE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT MEDDLE IN AFFAIRS THAT ARE TOO BIG FOR THEM HIS FINGERS CONTINUED TO GROPE THERE WAS A LIGHT LIKE A PALE BUT HOT FIRE BEHIND HIS EYES
THE THOUGHT CAME SUDDENLY INTO PIPPINS MIND AS IF CAUGHT DIRECT FROM THE URGENT THOUGHT OF HIS ENEMY GRISHNAKH KNOWS ABOUT THE RING HES LOOKING FOR IT WHILE UGLUK IS BUSY HE PROBABLY WANTS IT FOR HIMSELF COLD FEAR WAS IN PIPPINS HEART YET AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS WONDERING WHAT USE HE COULD MAKE OF GRISHNAKHS DESIRE
I DONT THINK YOU WILL FIND IT THAT WAY HE WHISPERED IT ISNT EASY TO FIND
FIND IT SAID GRISHNAKH HIS FINGERS STOPPED CRAWLING AND GRIPPED PIPPINS SHOULDER FIND WHAT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LITTLE ONE
FOR A MOMENT PIPPIN WAS SILENT THEN SUDDENLY IN THE DARKNESS HE MADE A NOISE IN HIS THROAT GOLLUM GOLLUM NOTHING MY PRECIOUS HE ADDED
THE HOBBITS FELT GRISHNAKHS FINGERS TWITCH O HO HISSED THE GOBLIN SOFTLY THATS WHAT HE MEANS IS IT O HO VERY VERY DANGEROUS MY LITTLE ONES
PERHAPS SAID MERRY NOW ALERT AND AWARE OF PIPPINS GUESS PERHAPS AND NOT ONLY FOR US STILL YOU KNOW YOUR OWN BUSINESS BEST DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT AND WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE FOR IT
DO I WANT IT DO I WANT IT SAID GRISHNAKH AS IF PUZZLED BUT HIS ARMS WERE TREMBLING WHAT WOULD I GIVE FOR IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE MEAN SAID PIPPIN CHOOSING HIS WORDS CAREFULLY THAT ITS NO GOOD GROPING IN THE DARK WE COULD SAVE YOU TIME AND TROUBLE BUT YOU MUST UNTIE OUR LEGS FIRST OR WELL DO NOTHING AND SAY NOTHING
MY DEAR TENDER LITTLE FOOLS HISSED GRISHNAKH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW WILL BE GOT OUT OF YOU IN DUE TIME EVERYTHING YOULL WISH THERE WAS MORE THAT YOU COULD TELL TO SATISFY THE QUESTIONER INDEED YOU WILL QUITE SOON WE SHANT HURRY THE ENQUIRY OH DEAR NO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUVE BEEN KEPT ALIVE FOR MY DEAR LITTLE FELLOWS PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT IT WAS NOT OUT OF KINDNESS THATS NOT EVEN ONE OF UGLUKS FAULTS
I FIND IT QUITE EASY TO BELIEVE SAID MERRY BUT YOU HAVENT GOT YOUR PREY HOME YET AND IT DOESNT SEEM TO BE GOING YOUR WAY WHATEVER HAPPENS IF WE COME TO ISENGARD IT WONT BE THE GREAT GRISHNAKH THAT BENEFITS SARUMAN WILL TAKE ALL THAT HE CAN FIND IF YOU WANT ANYTHING FOR YOURSELF NOWS THE TIME TO DO A DEAL
GRISHNAKH BEGAN TO LOSE HIS TEMPER THE NAME OF SARUMAN SEEMED SPECIALLY TO ENRAGE HIM TIME WAS PASSING AND THE DISTURBANCE WAS DYING DOWN UGLUK OR THE ISENGARDERS MIGHT RETURN AT ANY MINUTE
HAVE YOU GOT IT  EITHER OF YOU HE SNARLED
GOLLUM GOLLUM SAID PIPPIN
UNTIE OUR LEGS SAID MERRY
THEY FELT THE ORCS ARMS TREMBLING VIOLENTLY CURSE YOU YOU FILTHY LITTLE VERMIN HE HISSED UNTIE YOUR LEGS ILL UNTIE EVERY STRING IN YOUR BODIES DO YOU THINK I CANT SEARCH YOU TO THE BONES SEARCH YOU ILL CUT YOU BOTH TO QUIVERING SHREDS I DONT NEED THE HELP OF YOUR LEGS TO GET YOU AWAY  AND HAVE YOU ALL TO MYSELF
SUDDENLY HE SEIZED THEM THE STRENGTH IN HIS LONG ARMS AND SHOULDERS WAS TERRIFYING HE TUCKED THEM ONE UNDER EACH ARMPIT AND CRUSHED THEM FIERCELY TO HIS SIDES A GREAT STIFLING HAND WAS CLAPPED OVER EACH OF THEIR MOUTHS THEN HE SPRANG FORWARD STOOPING LOW QUICKLY AND SILENTLY HE WENT UNTIL HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE KNOLL THERE CHOOSING A GAP BETWEEN THE WATCHERS HE PASSED LIKE AN EVIL SHADOW OUT INTO THE NIGHT DOWN THE SLOPE AND AWAY WESTWARD TOWARDS THE RIVER THAT FLOWED OUT OF THE FOREST IN THAT DIRECTION THERE WAS A WIDE OPEN SPACE WITH ONLY ONE FIRE
AFTER GOING A DOZEN YARDS HE HALTED PEERING AND LISTENING NOTHING COULD BE SEEN OR HEARD HE CREPT SLOWLY ON BENT ALMOST DOUBLE THEN HE SQUATTED AND LISTENED AGAIN THEN HE STOOD UP AS IF TO RISK A SUDDEN DASH AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE DARK FORM OF A RIDER LOOMED UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM A HORSE SNORTED AND REARED A MAN CALLED OUT
GRISHNAKH FLUNG HIMSELF ON THE GROUND FLAT DRAGGING THE HOBBITS UNDER HIM THEN HE DREW HIS SWORD NO DOUBT HE MEANT TO KILL HIS CAPTIVES RATHER THAN ALLOW THEM TO ESCAPE OR TO BE RESCUED BUT IT WAS HIS UNDOING THE SWORD RANG FAINTLY AND GLINTED A LITTLE IN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE AWAY TO HIS LEFT AN ARROW CAME WHISTLING OUT OF THE GLOOM IT WAS AIMED WITH SKILL OR GUIDED BY FATE AND IT PIERCED HIS RIGHT HAND HE DROPPED THE SWORD AND SHRIEKED THERE WAS A QUICK BEAT OF HOOFS AND EVEN AS GRISHNAKH LEAPED UP AND RAN HE WAS RIDDEN DOWN AND A SPEAR PASSED THROUGH HIM HE GAVE A HIDEOUS SHIVERING CRY AND LAY STILL
THE HOBBITS REMAINED FLAT ON THE GROUND AS GRISHNAKH HAD LEFT THEM ANOTHER HORSEMAN CAME RIDING SWIFTLY TO HIS COMRADES AID WHETHER BECAUSE OF SOME SPECIAL KEENNESS OF SIGHT OR BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER SENSE THE HORSE LIFTED AND SPRANG LIGHTLY OVER THEM BUT ITS RIDER DID NOT SEE THEM LYING COVERED IN THEIR ELVENCLOAKS TOO CRUSHED FOR THE MOMENT AND TOO AFRAID TO MOVE
AT LAST MERRY STIRRED AND WHISPERED SOFTLY SO FAR SO GOOD BUT HOW ARE WE TO AVOID BEING SPITTED
THE ANSWER CAME ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE CRIES OF GRISHNAKH HAD ROUSED THE ORCS FROM THE YELLS AND SCREECHES THAT CAME FROM THE KNOLL THE HOBBITS GUESSED THAT THEIR DISAPPEARANCE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED UGLUK WAS PROBABLY KNOCKING OFF A FEW MORE HEADS THEN SUDDENLY THE ANSWERING CRIES OF ORCVOICES CAME FROM THE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE OF WATCHFIRES FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FOREST AND THE MOUNTAINS MAUHUR HAD APPARENTLY ARRIVED AND WAS ATTACKING THE BESIEGERS THERE WAS THE SOUND OF GALLOPING HORSES THE RIDERS WERE DRAWING IN THEIR RING CLOSE ROUND THE KNOLL RISKING THE ORCARROWS SO AS TO PREVENT ANY SORTIE WHILE A COMPANY RODE OFF TO DEAL WITH THE NEWCOMERS SUDDENLY MERRY AND PIPPIN REALIZED THAT WITHOUT MOVING THEY WERE NOW OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN THEM AND ESCAPE
NOW SAID MERRY IF ONLY WE HAD OUR LEGS AND HANDS FREE WE MIGHT GET AWAY BUT I CANT TOUCH THE KNOTS AND I CANT BITE THEM
NO NEED TO TRY SAID PIPPIN I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU IVE MANAGED TO FREE MY HANDS THESE LOOPS ARE ONLY LEFT FOR SHOW YOUD BETTER HAVE A BIT OF LEMBAS FIRST
HE SLIPPED THE CORDS OFF HIS WRISTS AND FISHED OUT A PACKET THE CAKES WERE BROKEN BUT GOOD STILL IN THEIR LEAFWRAPPINGS THE HOBBITS EACH ATE TWO OR THREE PIECES THE TASTE BROUGHT BACK TO THEM THE MEMORY OF FAIR FACES AND LAUGHTER AND WHOLESOME FOOD IN QUIET DAYS NOW FAR AWAY FOR A WHILE THEY ATE THOUGHTFULLY SITTING IN THE DARK HEEDLESS OF THE CRIES AND SOUNDS OF BATTLE NEARBY PIPPIN WAS THE FIRST TO COME BACK TO THE PRESENT
WE MUST BE OFF HE SAID HALF A MOMENT GRISHNAKHS SWORD WAS LYING CLOSE AT HAND BUT IT WAS TOO HEAVY AND CLUMSY FOR HIM TO USE SO HE CRAWLED FORWARD AND FINDING THE BODY OF THE GOBLIN HE DREW FROM ITS SHEATH A LONG SHARP KNIFE WITH THIS HE QUICKLY CUT THEIR BONDS
NOW FOR IT HE SAID WHEN WEVE WARMED UP A BIT PERHAPS WE SHALL BE ABLE TO STAND AGAIN AND WALK BUT IN ANY CASE WE HAD BETTER START BY CRAWLING
THEY CRAWLED THE TURF WAS DEEP AND YIELDING AND THAT HELPED THEM BUT IT SEEMED A LONG SLOW BUSINESS THEY GAVE THE WATCHFIRE A WIDE BERTH AND WORMED THEIR WAY FORWARD BIT BY BIT UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE RIVER GURGLING AWAY IN THE BLACK SHADOWS UNDER ITS DEEP BANKS THEN THEY LOOKED BACK
THE SOUNDS HAD DIED AWAY EVIDENTLY MAUHUR AND HIS LADS HAD BEEN KILLED OR DRIVEN OFF THE RIDERS HAD RETURNED TO THEIR SILENT OMINOUS VIGIL IT WOULD NOT LAST VERY MUCH LONGER ALREADY THE NIGHT WAS OLD IN THE EAST WHICH HAD REMAINED UNCLOUDED THE SKY WAS BEGINNING TO GROW PALE
WE MUST GET UNDER COVER SAID PIPPIN OR WE SHALL BE SEEN IT WILL NOT BE ANY COMFORT TO US IF THESE RIDERS DISCOVER THAT WE ARE NOT ORCS AFTER WE ARE DEAD HE GOT UP AND STAMPED HIS FEET THOSE CORDS HAVE CUT ME LIKE WIRES BUT MY FEET ARE GETTING WARM AGAIN I COULD STAGGER ON NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU MERRY
MERRY GOT UP YES HE SAID I CAN MANAGE IT LEMBAS DOES PUT HEART INTO YOU A MORE WHOLESOME SORT OF FEELING TOO THAN THE HEAT OF THAT ORCDRAUGHT I WONDER WHAT IT WAS MADE OF BETTER NOT TO KNOW I EXPECT LETS GET A DRINK OF WATER TO WASH AWAY THE THOUGHT OF IT
NOT HERE THE BANKS ARE TOO STEEP SAID PIPPIN FORWARD NOW
THEY TURNED AND WALKED SIDE BY SIDE SLOWLY ALONG THE LINE OF THE RIVER BEHIND THEM THE LIGHT GREW IN THE EAST AS THEY WALKED THEY COMPARED NOTES TALKING LIGHTLY IN HOBBITFASHION OF THE THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE THEIR CAPTURE NO LISTENER WOULD HAVE GUESSED FROM THEIR WORDS THAT THEY HAD SUFFERED CRUELLY AND BEEN IN DIRE PERIL GOING WITHOUT HOPE TOWARDS TORMENT AND DEATH OR THAT EVEN NOW AS THEY KNEW WELL THEY HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF EVER FINDING FRIEND OR SAFETY AGAIN
YOU SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DOING WELL MASTER TOOK SAID MERRY YOU WILL GET ALMOST A CHAPTER IN OLD BILBOS BOOK IF EVER I GET A CHANCE TO REPORT TO HIM GOOD WORK ESPECIALLY GUESSING THAT HAIRY VILLAINS LITTLE GAME AND PLAYING UP TO HIM BUT I WONDER IF ANYONE WILL EVER PICK UP YOUR TRAIL AND FIND THAT BROOCH I SHOULD HATE TO LOSE MINE BUT I AM AFRAID YOURS IS GONE FOR GOOD
I SHALL HAVE TO BRUSH UP MY TOES IF I AM TO GET LEVEL WITH YOU INDEED COUSIN BRANDYBUCK IS GOING IN FRONT NOW THIS IS WHERE HE COMES IN I DONT SUPPOSE YOU HAVE MUCH NOTION WHERE WE ARE BUT I SPENT MY TIME AT RIVENDELL RATHER BETTER WE ARE WALKING WEST ALONG THE ENTWASH THE BUTTEND OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS IS IN FRONT AND FANGORN FOREST
EVEN AS HE SPOKE THE DARK EDGE OF THE FOREST LOOMED UP STRAIGHT BEFORE THEM NIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN REFUGE UNDER ITS GREAT TREES CREEPING AWAY FROM THE COMING DAWN
LEAD ON MASTER BRANDYBUCK SAID PIPPIN OR LEAD BACK WE HAVE BEEN WARNED AGAINST FANGORN BUT ONE SO KNOWING WILL NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT
I HAVE NOT ANSWERED MERRY BUT THE FOREST SEEMS BETTER TO ME ALL THE SAME THAN TURNING BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE
HE LED THE WAY IN UNDER THE HUGE BRANCHES OF THE TREES OLD BEYOND GUESSING THEY SEEMED GREAT TRAILING BEARDS OF LICHEN HUNG FROM THEM BLOWING AND SWAYING IN THE BREEZE OUT OF THE SHADOWS THE HOBBITS PEEPED GAZING BACK DOWN THE SLOPE LITTLE FURTIVE FIGURES THAT IN THE DIM LIGHT LOOKED LIKE ELFCHILDREN IN THE DEEPS OF TIME PEERING OUT OF THE WILD WOOD IN WONDER AT THEIR FIRST DAWN
FAR OVER THE GREAT RIVER AND THE BROWN LANDS LEAGUES UPON GREY LEAGUES AWAY THE DAWN CAME RED AS FLAME LOUD RANG THE HUNTINGHORNS TO GREET IT THE RIDERS OF ROHAN SPRANG SUDDENLY TO LIFE HORN ANSWERED HORN AGAIN
MERRY AND PIPPIN HEARD CLEAR IN THE COLD AIR THE NEIGHING OF WARHORSES AND THE SUDDEN SINGING OF MANY MEN THE SUNS LIMB WAS LIFTED AN ARC OF FIRE ABOVE THE MARGIN OF THE WORLD THEN WITH A GREAT CRY THE RIDERS CHARGED FROM THE EAST THE RED LIGHT GLEAMED ON MAIL AND SPEAR THE ORCS YELLED AND SHOT ALL THE ARROWS THAT REMAINED TO THEM THE HOBBITS SAW SEVERAL HORSEMEN FALL BUT THEIR LINE HELD ON UP THE HILL AND OVER IT AND WHEELED ROUND AND CHARGED AGAIN MOST OF THE RAIDERS THAT WERE LEFT ALIVE THEN BROKE AND FLED THIS WAY AND THAT PURSUED ONE BY ONE TO THE DEATH BUT ONE BAND HOLDING TOGETHER IN A BLACK WEDGE DROVE FORWARD RESOLUTELY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FOREST STRAIGHT UP THE SLOPE THEY CHARGED TOWARDS THE WATCHERS NOW THEY WERE DRAWING NEAR AND IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD ESCAPE THEY HAD ALREADY HEWN DOWN THREE RIDERS THAT BARRED THEIR WAY
WE HAVE WATCHED TOO LONG SAID MERRY THERES UGLUK I DONT WANT TO MEET HIM AGAIN THE HOBBITS TURNED AND FLED DEEP INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE WOOD
SO IT WAS THAT THEY DID NOT SEE THE LAST STAND WHEN UGLUK WAS OVERTAKEN AND BROUGHT TO BAY AT THE VERY EDGE OF FANGORN THERE HE WAS SLAIN AT LAST BY EOMER THE THIRD MARSHAL OF THE MARK WHO DISMOUNTED AND FOUGHT HIM SWORD TO SWORD AND OVER THE WIDE FIELDS THE KEENEYED RIDERS HUNTED DOWN THE FEW ORCS THAT HAD ESCAPED AND STILL HAD STRENGTH TO FLY
THEN WHEN THEY HAD LAID THEIR FALLEN COMRADES IN A MOUND AND HAD SUNG THEIR PRAISES THE RIDERS MADE A GREAT FIRE AND SCATTERED THE ASHES OF THEIR ENEMIES SO ENDED THE RAID AND NO NEWS OF IT CAME EVER BACK EITHER TO MORDOR OR TO ISENGARD BUT THE SMOKE OF THE BURNING ROSE HIGH TO HEAVEN AND WAS SEEN BY MANY WATCHFUL EYES



CHAPTER 4
TREEBEARD

MEANWHILE THE HOBBITS WENT WITH AS MUCH SPEED AS THE DARK AND TANGLED FOREST ALLOWED FOLLOWING THE LINE OF THE RUNNING STREAM WESTWARD AND UP TOWARDS THE SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO FANGORN SLOWLY THEIR FEAR OF THE ORCS DIED AWAY AND THEIR PACE SLACKENED A QUEER STIFLING FEELING CAME OVER THEM AS IF THE AIR WERE TOO THIN OR TOO SCANTY FOR BREATHING
AT LAST MERRY HALTED WE CANT GO ON LIKE THIS HE PANTED I WANT SOME AIR
LETS HAVE A DRINK AT ANY RATE SAID PIPPIN IM PARCHED HE CLAMBERED ON TO A GREAT TREEROOT THAT WOUND DOWN INTO THE STREAM AND STOOPING DREW UP SOME WATER IN HIS CUPPED HANDS IT WAS CLEAR AND COLD AND HE TOOK MANY DRAUGHTS MERRY FOLLOWED HIM THE WATER REFRESHED THEM AND SEEMED TO CHEER THEIR HEARTS FOR A WHILE THEY SAT TOGETHER ON THE BRINK OF THE STREAM DABBLING THEIR SORE FEET AND LEGS AND PEERING ROUND AT THE TREES THAT STOOD SILENTLY ABOUT THEM RANK UPON RANK UNTIL THEY FADED AWAY INTO GREY TWILIGHT IN EVERY DIRECTION
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVENT LOST US ALREADY SAID PIPPIN LEANING BACK AGAINST A GREAT TREETRUNK WE CAN AT LEAST FOLLOW THE COURSE OF THIS STREAM THE ENTWASH OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT AND GET OUT AGAIN THE WAY WE CAME
WE COULD IF OUR LEGS WOULD DO IT SAID MERRY AND IF WE COULD BREATHE PROPERLY
YES IT IS ALL VERY DIM AND STUFFY IN HERE SAID PIPPIN IT REMINDS ME SOMEHOW OF THE OLD ROOM IN THE GREAT PLACE OF THE TOOKS AWAY BACK IN THE SMIALS AT TUCKBOROUGH A HUGE PLACE WHERE THE FURNITURE HAS NEVER BEEN MOVED OR CHANGED FOR GENERATIONS THEY SAY THE OLD TOOK LIVED IN IT YEAR AFTER YEAR WHILE HE AND THE ROOM GOT OLDER AND SHABBIER TOGETHER  AND IT HAS NEVER CHANGED SINCE HE DIED A CENTURY AGO AND OLD GERONTIUS WAS MY GREATGREATGRANDFATHER THAT PUTS IT BACK A BIT BUT THAT IS NOTHING TO THE OLD FEELING OF THIS WOOD LOOK AT ALL THOSE WEEPING TRAILING BEARDS AND WHISKERS OF LICHEN AND MOST OF THE TREES SEEM TO BE HALF COVERED WITH RAGGED DRY LEAVES THAT HAVE NEVER FALLEN UNTIDY I CANT IMAGINE WHAT SPRING WOULD LOOK LIKE HERE IF IT EVER COMES STILL LESS A SPRINGCLEANING
BUT THE SUN AT ANY RATE MUST PEEP IN SOMETIMES SAID MERRY IT DOES NOT LOOK OR FEEL AT ALL LIKE BILBOS DESCRIPTION OF MIRKWOOD THAT WAS ALL DARK AND BLACK AND THE HOME OF DARK BLACK THINGS THIS IS JUST DIM AND FRIGHTFULLY TREEISH YOU CANT IMAGINE ANIMALS LIVING HERE AT ALL OR STAYING FOR LONG
NO NOR HOBBITS SAID PIPPIN AND I DONT LIKE THE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO GET THROUGH IT EITHER NOTHING TO EAT FOR A HUNDRED MILES I SHOULD GUESS HOW ARE OUR SUPPLIES
LOW SAID MERRY WE RAN OFF WITH NOTHING BUT A COUPLE OF SPARE PACKETS OF LEMBAS AND LEFT EVERYTHING ELSE BEHIND THEY LOOKED AT WHAT REMAINED OF THE ELVENCAKES BROKEN FRAGMENTS FOR ABOUT FIVE MEAGRE DAYS THAT WAS ALL AND NOT A WRAP OR A BLANKET SAID MERRY WE SHALL BE COLD TONIGHT WHICHEVER WAY WE GO
WELL WED BETTER DECIDE ON THE WAY NOW SAID PIPPIN THE MORNING MUST BE GETTING ON
JUST THEN THEY BECAME AWARE OF A YELLOW LIGHT THAT HAD APPEARED SOME WAY FURTHER ON INTO THE WOOD SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE PIERCED THE FORESTROOF
HULLO SAID MERRY THE SUN MUST HAVE RUN INTO A CLOUD WHILE WEVE BEEN UNDER THESE TREES AND NOW SHE HAS RUN OUT AGAIN OR ELSE SHE HAS CLIMBED HIGH ENOUGH TO LOOK DOWN THROUGH SOME OPENING IT ISNT FAR  LETS GO AND INVESTIGATE
THEY FOUND IT WAS FURTHER THAN THEY THOUGHT THE GROUND WAS RISING STEEPLY STILL AND IT WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY STONY THE LIGHT GREW BROADER AS THEY WENT ON AND SOON THEY SAW THAT THERE WAS A ROCKWALL BEFORE THEM THE SIDE OF A HILL OR THE ABRUPT END OF SOME LONG ROOT THRUST OUT BY THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS NO TREES GREW ON IT AND THE SUN WAS FALLING FULL ON ITS STONY FACE THE TWIGS OF THE TREES AT ITS FOOT WERE STRETCHED OUT STIFF AND STILL AS IF REACHING OUT TO THE WARMTH WHERE ALL HAD LOOKED SO SHABBY AND GREY BEFORE THE WOOD NOW GLEAMED WITH RICH BROWNS AND WITH THE SMOOTH BLACKGREYS OF BARK LIKE POLISHED LEATHER THE BOLES OF THE TREES GLOWED WITH A SOFT GREEN LIKE YOUNG GRASS EARLY SPRING OR A FLEETING VISION OF IT WAS ABOUT THEM
IN THE FACE OF THE STONY WALL THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A STAIR NATURAL PERHAPS AND MADE BY THE WEATHERING AND SPLITTING OF THE ROCK FOR IT WAS ROUGH AND UNEVEN HIGH UP ALMOST LEVEL WITH THE TOPS OF FORESTTREES THERE WAS A SHELF UNDER A CLIFF NOTHING GREW THERE BUT A FEW GRASSES AND WEEDS AT ITS EDGE AND ONE OLD STUMP OF A TREE WITH ONLY TWO BENT BRANCHES LEFT IT LOOKED ALMOST LIKE THE FIGURE OF SOME GNARLED OLD MAN STANDING THERE BLINKING IN THE MORNINGLIGHT
UP WE GO SAID MERRY JOYFULLY NOW FOR A BREATH OF AIR AND A SIGHT OF THE LAND
THEY CLIMBED AND SCRAMBLED UP THE ROCK IF THE STAIR HAD BEEN MADE IT WAS FOR BIGGER FEET AND LONGER LEGS THAN THEIRS THEY WERE TOO EAGER TO BE SURPRISED AT THE REMARKABLE WAY IN WHICH THE CUTS AND SORES OF THEIR CAPTIVITY HAD HEALED AND THEIR VIGOUR HAD RETURNED THEY CAME AT LENGTH TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF ALMOST AT THE FEET OF THE OLD STUMP THEN THEY SPRANG UP AND TURNED ROUND WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE HILL BREATHING DEEP AND LOOKING OUT EASTWARD THEY SAW THAT THEY HAD ONLY COME SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES INTO THE FOREST THE HEADS OF THE TREES MARCHED DOWN THE SLOPES TOWARDS THE PLAIN THERE NEAR THE FRINGE OF THE FOREST TALL SPIRES OF CURLING BLACK SMOKE WENT UP WAVERING AND FLOATING TOWARDS THEM
THE WINDS CHANGING SAID MERRY ITS TURNED EAST AGAIN IT FEELS COOL UP HERE
YES SAID PIPPIN IM AFRAID THIS IS ONLY A PASSING GLEAM AND IT WILL ALL GO GREY AGAIN WHAT A PITY THIS SHAGGY OLD FOREST LOOKED SO DIFFERENT IN THE SUNLIGHT I ALMOST FELT I LIKED THE PLACE
ALMOST FELT YOU LIKED THE FOREST THATS GOOD THATS UNCOMMONLY KIND OF YOU SAID A STRANGE VOICE TURN ROUND AND LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR FACES I ALMOST FEEL THAT I DISLIKE YOU BOTH BUT DO NOT LET US BE HASTY TURN ROUND A LARGE KNOBKNUCKLED HAND WAS LAID ON EACH OF THEIR SHOULDERS AND THEY WERE TWISTED ROUND GENTLY BUT IRRESISTIBLY THEN TWO GREAT ARMS LIFTED THEM UP
THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT A MOST EXTRAORDINARY FACE IT BELONGED TO A LARGE MANLIKE ALMOST TROLLLIKE FIGURE AT LEAST FOURTEEN FOOT HIGH VERY STURDY WITH A TALL HEAD AND HARDLY ANY NECK WHETHER IT WAS CLAD IN STUFF LIKE GREEN AND GREY BARK OR WHETHER THAT WAS ITS HIDE WAS DIFFICULT TO SAY AT ANY RATE THE ARMS AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE TRUNK WERE NOT WRINKLED BUT COVERED WITH A BROWN SMOOTH SKIN THE LARGE FEET HAD SEVEN TOES EACH THE LOWER PART OF THE LONG FACE WAS COVERED WITH A SWEEPING GREY BEARD BUSHY ALMOST TWIGGY AT THE ROOTS THIN AND MOSSY AT THE ENDS BUT AT THE MOMENT THE HOBBITS NOTED LITTLE BUT THE EYES THESE DEEP EYES WERE NOW SURVEYING THEM SLOW AND SOLEMN BUT VERY PENETRATING THEY WERE BROWN SHOT WITH A GREEN LIGHT OFTEN AFTERWARDS PIPPIN TRIED TO DESCRIBE HIS FIRST IMPRESSION OF THEM
ONE FELT AS IF THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS WELL BEHIND THEM FILLED UP WITH AGES OF MEMORY AND LONG SLOW STEADY THINKING BUT THEIR SURFACE WAS SPARKLING WITH THE PRESENT LIKE SUN SHIMMERING ON THE OUTER LEAVES OF A VAST TREE OR ON THE RIPPLES OF A VERY DEEP LAKE I DONT KNOW BUT IT FELT AS IF SOMETHING THAT GREW IN THE GROUND  ASLEEP YOU MIGHT SAY OR JUST FEELING ITSELF AS SOMETHING BETWEEN ROOFTIP AND LEAFTIP BETWEEN DEEP EARTH AND SKY HAD SUDDENLY WAKED UP AND WAS CONSIDERING YOU WITH THE SAME SLOW CARE THAT IT HAD GIVEN TO ITS OWN INSIDE AFFAIRS FOR ENDLESS YEARS
HRUM HOOM MURMURED THE VOICE A DEEP VOICE LIKE A VERY DEEP WOODWIND INSTRUMENT VERY ODD INDEED DO NOT BE HASTY THAT IS MY MOTTO BUT IF I HAD SEEN YOU BEFORE I HEARD YOUR VOICES  I LIKED THEM NICE LITTLE VOICES THEY REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING I CANNOT REMEMBER  IF I HAD SEEN YOU BEFORE I HEARD YOU I SHOULD HAVE JUST TRODDEN ON YOU TAKING YOU FOR LITTLE ORCS AND FOUND OUT MY MISTAKE AFTERWARDS VERY ODD YOU ARE INDEED ROOT AND TWIG VERY ODD
PIPPIN THOUGH STILL AMAZED NO LONGER FELT AFRAID UNDER THOSE EYES HE FELT A CURIOUS SUSPENSE BUT NOT FEAR PLEASE HE SAID WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU
A QUEER LOOK CAME INTO THE OLD EYES A KIND OF WARINESS THE DEEP WELLS WERE COVERED OVER HRUM NOW ANSWERED THE VOICE WELL I AM AN ENT OR THATS WHAT THEY CALL ME YES ENT IS THE WORD THE ENT I AM YOU MIGHT SAY IN YOUR MANNER OF SPEAKING FANGORN IS MY NAME ACCORDING TO SOME TREEBEARD OTHERS MAKE IT TREEBEARD WILL DO

HOLDING THE HOBBITS GENTLY BUT FIRMLY ONE IN THE CROOK OF EACH ARM TREEBEARD LIFTED UP FIRST ONE LARGE FOOT AND THEN THE OTHER AND MOVED THEM TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF THE ROOTLIKE TOES GRASPED THE ROCKS THEN CAREFULLY AND SOLEMNLY HE STALKED DOWN FROM STEP TO STEP AND REACHED THE FLOOR OF THE FOREST
AT ONCE HE SET OFF WITH LONG DELIBERATE STRIDES THROUGH THE TREES DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD NEVER FAR FROM THE STREAM CLIMBING STEADILY UP TOWARDS THE SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS MANY OF THE TREES SEEMED ASLEEP OR AS UNAWARE OF HIM AS OF ANY OTHER CREATURE THAT MERELY PASSED BY BUT SOME QUIVERED AND SOME RAISED UP THEIR BRANCHES ABOVE HIS HEAD AS HE APPROACHED ALL THE WHILE AS HE WALKED HE TALKED TO HIMSELF IN A LONG RUNNING STREAM OF MUSICAL SOUNDS
THE HOBBITS WERE SILENT FOR SOME TIME THEY FELT ODDLY ENOUGH SAFE AND COMFORTABLE AND THEY HAD A GREAT DEAL TO THINK AND WONDER ABOUT AT LAST PIPPIN VENTURED TO SPEAK AGAIN
PLEASE TREEBEARD HE SAID COULD I ASK YOU SOMETHING WHY DID CELEBORN WARN US AGAINST YOUR FOREST HE TOLD US NOT TO RISK GETTING ENTANGLED IN IT
HMM DID HE NOW RUMBLED TREEBEARD AND I MIGHT HAVE SAID MUCH THE SAME IF YOU HAD BEEN GOING THE OTHER WAY DO NOT RISK GETTING ENTANGLED IN THE WOODS OF LAURELINDORENAN THAT IS WHAT THE ELVES USED TO CALL IT BUT NOW THEY MAKE THE NAME SHORTER LOTHLORIEN THEY CALL IT PERHAPS THEY ARE RIGHT MAYBE IT IS FADING NOT GROWING LAND OF THE VALLEY OF SINGING GOLD THAT WAS IT ONCE UPON A TIME NOW IT IS THE DREAMFLOWER AH WELL BUT IT IS A QUEER PLACE AND NOT FOR JUST ANY ONE TO VENTURE IN I AM SURPRISED THAT YOU EVER GOT OUT BUT MUCH MORE SURPRISED THAT YOU EVER GOT IN THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED TO STRANGERS FOR MANY A YEAR IT IS A QUEER LAND

TAURELILOMEATUMBALEMORNA TUMBALETAUREA LOMEANOR 1

THAT IS WHAT THEY USED TO SAY THINGS HAVE CHANGED BUT IT IS STILL TRUE IN PLACES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID PIPPIN WHAT IS TRUE
THE TREES AND THE ENTS SAID TREEBEARD I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THAT GOES ON MYSELF SO I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT TO YOU SOME OF US ARE STILL TRUE ENTS AND LIVELY ENOUGH IN OUR FASHION BUT MANY ARE GROWING SLEEPY GOING TREEISH AS YOU MIGHT SAY MOST OF THE TREES ARE JUST TREES OF COURSE BUT MANY ARE HALF AWAKE SOME ARE QUITE WIDE AWAKE AND A FEW ARE WELL AH WELL GETTING ENTISH THAT IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME
WHEN THAT HAPPENS TO A TREE YOU FIND THAT SOME HAVE BAD HEARTS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR WOOD I DO NOT MEAN THAT WHY I KNEW SOME GOOD OLD WILLOWS DOWN THE ENTWASH GONE LONG AGO ALAS THEY WERE QUITE HOLLOW INDEED THEY WERE FALLING ALL TO PIECES BUT AS QUIET AND SWEETSPOKEN AS A YOUNG LEAF AND THEN THERE ARE SOME TREES IN THE VALLEYS UNDER THE MOUNTAINS SOUND AS A BELL AND BAD RIGHT THROUGH THAT SORT OF THING SEEMS TO SPREAD THERE USED TO BE SOME VERY DANGEROUS PARTS IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE STILL SOME VERY BLACK PATCHES
LIKE THE OLD FOREST AWAY TO THE NORTH DO YOU MEAN ASKED MERRY
AYE AYE SOMETHING LIKE BUT MUCH WORSE I DO NOT DOUBT THERE IS SOME SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARKNESS LYING THERE STILL AWAY NORTH AND BAD MEMORIES ARE HANDED DOWN BUT THERE ARE HOLLOW DALES IN THIS LAND WHERE THE DARKNESS HAS NEVER BEEN LIFTED AND THE TREES ARE OLDER THAN I AM STILL WE DO WHAT WE CAN WE KEEP OFF STRANGERS AND THE FOOLHARDY AND WE TRAIN AND WE TEACH WE WALK AND WE WEED
WE ARE TREEHERDS WE OLD ENTS FEW ENOUGH OF US ARE LEFT NOW SHEEP GET LIKE SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDS LIKE SHEEP IT IS SAID BUT SLOWLY AND NEITHER HAVE LONG IN THE WORLD IT IS QUICKER AND CLOSER WITH TREES AND ENTS AND THEY WALK DOWN THE AGES TOGETHER FOR ENTS ARE MORE LIKE ELVES LESS INTERESTED IN THEMSELVES THAN MEN ARE AND BETTER AT GETTING INSIDE OTHER THINGS AND YET AGAIN ENTS ARE MORE LIKE MEN MORE CHANGEABLE THAN ELVES ARE AND QUICKER AT TAKING THE COLOUR OF THE OUTSIDE YOU MIGHT SAY OR BETTER THAN BOTH FOR THEY ARE STEADIER AND KEEP THEIR MINDS ON THINGS LONGER SOME OF MY KIN LOOK JUST LIKE TREES NOW AND NEED SOMETHING GREAT TO ROUSE THEM AND THEY SPEAK ONLY IN WHISPERS BUT SOME OF MY TREES ARE LIMBLITHE AND MANY CAN TALK TO ME ELVES BEGAN IT OF COURSE WAKING TREES UP AND TEACHING THEM TO SPEAK AND LEARNING THEIR TREETALK THEY ALWAYS WISHED TO TALK TO EVERYTHING THE OLD ELVES DID BUT THEN THE GREAT DARKNESS CAME AND THEY PASSED AWAY OVER THE SEA OR FLED INTO FAR VALLEYS AND HID THEMSELVES AND MADE SONGS ABOUT DAYS THAT WOULD NEVER COME AGAIN NEVER AGAIN AYE AYE THERE WAS ALL ONE WOOD ONCE UPON A TIME FROM HERE TO THE MOUNTAINS OF LUNE AND THIS WAS JUST THE EAST END
THOSE WERE THE BROAD DAYS TIME WAS WHEN I COULD WALK AND SING ALL DAY AND HEAR NO MORE THAN THE ECHO OF MY OWN VOICE IN THE HOLLOW HILLS THE WOODS WERE LIKE THE WOODS OF LOTHLORIEN ONLY THICKER STRONGER YOUNGER AND THE SMELL OF THE AIR I USED TO SPEND A WEEK JUST BREATHING
TREEBEARD FELL SILENT STRIDING ALONG AND YET MAKING HARDLY A SOUND WITH HIS GREAT FEET THEN HE BEGAN TO HUM AGAIN AND PASSED INTO A MURMURING CHANT GRADUALLY THE HOBBITS BECAME AWARE THAT HE WAS CHANTING TO THEM
IN THE WILLOWMEADS OF TASARINAN I WALKED IN THE SPRING
AH THE SIGHT AND THE SMELL OF THE SPRING IN NANTASARION
AND I SAID THAT WAS GOOD
I WANDERED IN SUMMER IN THE ELMWOODS OF OSSIRIAND
AH THE LIGHT AND THE MUSIC IN THE SUMMER BY THE SEVEN RIVERS OF OSSIR
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS BEST
TO THE BEECHES OF NELDORETH I CAME IN THE AUTUMN
AH THE GOLD AND THE RED AND THE SIGHING OF LEAVES IN THE AUTUMN IN TAURNANELDOR
IT WAS MORE THAN MY DESIRE
TO THE PINETREES UPON THE HIGHLAND OF DORTHONION I CLIMBED IN THE WINTER
AH THE WIND AND THE WHITENESS AND THE BLACK BRANCHES OF WINTER UPON ORODNATHON
MY VOICE WENT UP AND SANG IN THE SKY
AND NOW ALL THOSE LANDS LIE UNDER THE WAVE
AND I WALK IN AMBARONA IN TAUREMORNA IN ALDALOME
IN MY OWN LAND IN THE COUNTRY OF FANGORN
WHERE THE ROOTS ARE LONG
AND THE YEARS LIE THICKER THAN THE LEAVES
IN TAUREMORNALOME

HE ENDED AND STRODE ON SILENTLY AND IN ALL THE WOOD AS FAR AS EAR COULD REACH THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
THE DAY WANED AND DUSK WAS TWINED ABOUT THE BOLES OF THE TREES AT LAST THE HOBBITS SAW RISING DIMLY BEFORE THEM A STEEP DARK LAND THEY HAD COME TO THE FEET OF THE MOUNTAINS AND TO THE GREEN ROOTS OF TALL METHEDRAS DOWN THE HILLSIDE THE YOUNG ENTWASH LEAPING FROM ITS SPRINGS HIGH ABOVE RAN NOISILY FROM STEP TO STEP TO MEET THEM ON THE RIGHT OF THE STREAM THERE WAS A LONG SLOPE CLAD WITH GRASS NOW GREY IN THE TWILIGHT NO TREES GREW THERE AND IT WAS OPEN TO THE SKY STARS WERE SHINING ALREADY IN LAKES BETWEEN SHORES OF CLOUD
TREEBEARD STRODE UP THE SLOPE HARDLY SLACKENING HIS PACE SUDDENLY BEFORE THEM THE HOBBITS SAW A WIDE OPENING TWO GREAT TREES STOOD THERE ONE ON EITHER SIDE LIKE LIVING GATEPOSTS BUT THERE WAS NO GATE SAVE THEIR CROSSING AND INTERWOVEN BOUGHS AS THE OLD ENT APPROACHED THE TREES LIFTED UP THEIR BRANCHES AND ALL THEIR LEAVES QUIVERED AND RUSTLED FOR THEY WERE EVERGREEN TREES AND THEIR LEAVES WERE DARK AND POLISHED AND GLEAMED IN THE TWILIGHT BEYOND THEM WAS A WIDE LEVEL SPACE AS THOUGH THE FLOOR OF A GREAT HALL HAD BEEN CUT IN THE SIDE OF THE HILL ON EITHER HAND THE WALLS SLOPED UPWARDS UNTIL THEY WERE FIFTY FEET HIGH OR MORE AND ALONG EACH WALL STOOD AN AISLE OF TREES THAT ALSO INCREASED IN HEIGHT AS THEY MARCHED INWARDS
AT THE FAR END THE ROCKWALL WAS SHEER BUT AT THE BOTTOM IT HAD BEEN HOLLOWED BACK INTO A SHALLOW BAY WITH AN ARCHED ROOF THE ONLY ROOF OF THE HALL SAVE THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES WHICH AT THE INNER END OVERSHADOWED ALL THE GROUND LEAVING ONLY A BROAD OPEN PATH IN THE MIDDLE A LITTLE STREAM ESCAPED FROM THE SPRINGS ABOVE AND LEAVING THE MAIN WATER FELL TINKLING DOWN THE SHEER FACE OF THE WALL POURING IN SILVER DROPS LIKE A FINE CURTAIN IN FRONT OF THE ARCHED BAY THE WATER WAS GATHERED AGAIN INTO A STONE BASIN IN THE FLOOR BETWEEN THE TREES AND THENCE IT SPILLED AND FLOWED AWAY BESIDE THE OPEN PATH OUT TO REJOIN THE ENTWASH IN ITS JOURNEY THROUGH THE FOREST
HM HERE WE ARE SAID TREEBEARD BREAKING HIS LONG SILENCE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND ENTSTRIDES BUT WHAT THAT COMES TO IN THE MEASUREMENT OF YOUR LAND I DO NOT KNOW ANYHOW WE ARE NEAR THE ROOTS OF THE LAST MOUNTAIN PART OF THE NAME OF THIS PLACE MIGHT BE WELLINGHALL IF IT WERE TURNED INTO YOUR LANGUAGE I LIKE IT WE WILL STAY HERE TONIGHT HE SET THEM DOWN ON THE GRASS BETWEEN THE AISLES OF THE TREES AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM TOWARDS THE GREAT ARCH THE HOBBITS NOW NOTICED THAT AS HE WALKED HIS KNEES HARDLY BENT BUT HIS LEGS OPENED IN A GREAT STRIDE HE PLANTED HIS BIG TOES AND THEY WERE INDEED BIG AND VERY BROAD ON THE GROUND FIRST BEFORE ANY OTHER PART OF HIS FEET
FOR A MOMENT TREEBEARD STOOD UNDER THE RAIN OF THE FALLING SPRING AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH THEN HE LAUGHED AND PASSED INSIDE A GREAT STONE TABLE STOOD THERE BUT NO CHAIRS AT THE BACK OF THE BAY IT WAS ALREADY QUITE DARK TREEBEARD LIFTED TWO GREAT VESSELS AND STOOD THEM ON THE TABLE THEY SEEMED TO BE FILLED WITH WATER BUT HE HELD HIS HANDS OVER THEM AND IMMEDIATELY THEY BEGAN TO GLOW ONE WITH A GOLDEN AND THE OTHER WITH A RICH GREEN LIGHT AND THE BLENDING OF THE TWO LIGHTS LIT THE BAY AS IF THE SUN OF SUMMER WAS SHINING THROUGH A ROOF OF YOUNG LEAVES LOOKING BACK THE HOBBITS SAW THAT THE TREES IN THE COURT HAD ALSO BEGUN TO GLOW FAINTLY AT FIRST BUT STEADILY QUICKENING UNTIL EVERY LEAF WAS EDGED WITH LIGHT SOME GREEN SOME GOLD SOME RED AS COPPER WHILE THE TREETRUNKS LOOKED LIKE PILLARS MOULDED OUT OF LUMINOUS STONE
WELL WELL NOW WE CAN TALK AGAIN SAID TREEBEARD YOU ARE THIRSTY I EXPECT PERHAPS YOU ARE ALSO TIRED DRINK THIS HE WENT TO THE BACK OF THE BAY AND THEN THEY SAW THAT SEVERAL TALL STONE JARS STOOD THERE WITH HEAVY LIDS HE REMOVED ONE OF THE LIDS AND DIPPED IN A GREAT LADLE AND WITH IT FILLED THREE BOWLS ONE VERY LARGE BOWL AND TWO SMALLER ONES
THIS IS AN ENTHOUSE HE SAID AND THERE ARE NO SEATS I FEAR BUT YOU MAY SIT ON THE TABLE PICKING UP THE HOBBITS HE SET THEM ON THE GREAT STONE SLAB SIX FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND THERE THEY SAT DANGLING THEIR LEGS AND DRINKING IN SIPS
THE DRINK WAS LIKE WATER INDEED VERY LIKE THE TASTE OF THE DRAUGHTS THEY HAD DRUNK FROM THE ENTWASH NEAR THE BORDERS OF THE FOREST AND YET THERE WAS SOME SCENT OR SAVOUR IN IT WHICH THEY COULD NOT DESCRIBE IT WAS FAINT BUT IT REMINDED THEM OF THE SMELL OF A DISTANT WOOD BORNE FROM AFAR BY A COOL BREEZE AT NIGHT THE EFFECT OF THE DRAUGHT BEGAN AT THE TOES AND ROSE STEADILY THROUGH EVERY LIMB BRINGING REFRESHMENT AND VIGOUR AS IT COURSED UPWARDS RIGHT TO THE TIPS OF THE HAIR INDEED THE HOBBITS FELT THAT THE HAIR ON THEIR HEADS WAS ACTUALLY STANDING UP WAVING AND CURLING AND GROWING AS FOR TREEBEARD HE FIRST LAVED HIS FEET IN THE BASIN BEYOND THE ARCH AND THEN HE DRAINED HIS BOWL AT ONE DRAUGHT ONE LONG SLOW DRAUGHT THE HOBBITS THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER STOP
AT LAST HE SET THE BOWL DOWN AGAIN AH  AH HE SIGHED HM HOOM NOW WE CAN TALK EASIER YOU CAN SIT ON THE FLOOR AND I WILL LIE DOWN THAT WILL PREVENT THIS DRINK FROM RISING TO MY HEAD AND SENDING ME TO SLEEP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BAY THERE WAS A GREAT BED ON LOW LEGS NOT MORE THAN A COUPLE OF FEET HIGH COVERED DEEP IN DRIED GRASS AND BRACKEN TREEBEARD LOWERED HIMSELF SLOWLY ON TO THIS WITH ONLY THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF BENDING AT HIS MIDDLE UNTIL HE LAY AT FULL LENGTH WITH HIS ARMS BEHIND HIS HEAD LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING UPON WHICH LIGHTS WERE FLICKERING LIKE THE PLAY OF LEAVES IN THE SUNSHINE MERRY AND PIPPIN SAT BESIDE HIM ON PILLOWS OF GRASS
NOW TELL ME YOUR TALE AND DO NOT HURRY SAID TREEBEARD
THE HOBBITS BEGAN TO TELL HIM THE STORY OF THEIR ADVENTURES EVER SINCE THEY LEFT HOBBITON THEY FOLLOWED NO VERY CLEAR ORDER FOR THEY INTERRUPTED ONE ANOTHER CONTINUALLY AND TREEBEARD OFTEN STOPPED THE SPEAKER AND WENT BACK TO SOME EARLIER POINT OR JUMPED FORWARD ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT LATER EVENTS THEY SAID NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT THE RING AND DID NOT TELL HIM WHY THEY SET OUT OR WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO AND HE DID NOT ASK FOR ANY REASONS
HE WAS IMMENSELY INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING IN THE BLACK RIDERS IN ELROND AND RIVENDELL IN THE OLD FOREST AND TOM BOMBADIL IN THE MINES OF MORIA AND IN LOTHLORIEN AND GALADRIEL HE MADE THEM DESCRIBE THE SHIRE AND ITS COUNTRY OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE SAID AN ODD THING AT THIS POINT YOU NEVER SEE ANY HM ANY ENTS ROUND THERE DO YOU HE ASKED WELL NOT ENTS ENTWIVES I SHOULD REALLY SAY
ENTWIVES SAID PIPPIN ARE THEY LIKE YOU AT ALL
YES HM WELL NO I DO NOT REALLY KNOW NOW SAID TREEBEARD THOUGHTFULLY BUT THEY WOULD LIKE YOUR COUNTRY SO I JUST WONDERED
TREEBEARD WAS HOWEVER ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING THAT CONCERNED GANDALF AND MOST INTERESTED OF ALL IN SARUMANS DOINGS THE HOBBITS REGRETTED VERY MUCH THAT THEY KNEW SO LITTLE ABOUT THEM ONLY A RATHER VAGUE REPORT BY SAM OF WHAT GANDALF HAD TOLD THE COUNCIL BUT THEY WERE CLEAR AT ANY RATE THAT UGLUK AND HIS TROOP CAME FROM ISENGARD AND SPOKE OF SARUMAN AS THEIR MASTER
HM HOOM SAID TREEBEARD WHEN AT LAST THEIR STORY HAD WOUND AND WANDERED DOWN TO THE BATTLE OF THE ORCS AND THE RIDERS OF ROHAN WELL WELL THAT IS A BUNDLE OF NEWS AND NO MISTAKE YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME ALL NO INDEED NOT BY A LONG WAY BUT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU ARE DOING AS GANDALF WOULD WISH THERE IS SOMETHING VERY BIG GOING ON THAT I CAN SEE AND WHAT IT IS MAYBE I SHALL LEARN IN GOOD TIME OR IN BAD TIME BY ROOT AND TWIG BUT IT IS A STRANGE BUSINESS UP SPROUT A LITTLE FOLK THAT ARE NOT IN THE OLD LISTS AND BEHOLD THE NINE FORGOTTEN RIDERS REAPPEAR TO HUNT THEM AND GANDALF TAKES THEM ON A GREAT JOURNEY AND GALADRIEL HARBOURS THEM IN CARAS GALADHON AND ORCS PURSUE THEM DOWN ALL THE LEAGUES OF WILDERLAND INDEED THEY SEEM TO BE CAUGHT UP IN A GREAT STORM I HOPE THEY WEATHER IT
AND WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF ASKED MERRY
HOOM HM I HAVE NOT TROUBLED ABOUT THE GREAT WARS SAID TREEBEARD THEY MOSTLY CONCERN ELVES AND MEN THAT IS THE BUSINESS OF WIZARDS WIZARDS ARE ALWAYS TROUBLED ABOUT THE FUTURE I DO NOT LIKE WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE I AM NOT ALTOGETHER ON ANYBODYS SIDE BECAUSE NOBODY IS ALTOGETHER ON MY SIDE IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME NOBODY CARES FOR THE WOODS AS I CARE FOR THEM NOT EVEN ELVES NOWADAYS STILL I TAKE MORE KINDLY TO ELVES THAN TO OTHERS IT WAS THE ELVES THAT CURED US OF DUMBNESS LONG AGO AND THAT WAS A GREAT GIFT THAT CANNOT BE FORGOTTEN THOUGH OUR WAYS HAVE PARTED SINCE AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS OF COURSE WHOSE SIDE I AM ALTOGETHER NOT ON I AM AGAINST THEM ALTOGETHER THESE  BURARUM HE AGAIN MADE A DEEP RUMBLE OF DISGUST  THESE ORCS AND THEIR MASTERS
I USED TO BE ANXIOUS WHEN THE SHADOW LAY ON MIRKWOOD BUT WHEN IT REMOVED TO MORDOR I DID NOT TROUBLE FOR A WHILE MORDOR IS A LONG WAY AWAY BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE WIND IS SETTING EAST AND THE WITHERING OF ALL WOODS MAY BE DRAWING NEAR THERE IS NAUGHT THAT AN OLD ENT CAN DO TO HOLD BACK THAT STORM HE MUST WEATHER IT OR CRACK
BUT SARUMAN NOW SARUMAN IS A NEIGHBOUR I CANNOT OVERLOOK HIM I MUST DO SOMETHING I SUPPOSE I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED LATELY WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT SARUMAN
WHO IS SARUMAN ASKED PIPPIN DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS HISTORY
SARUMAN IS A WIZARD ANSWERED TREEBEARD MORE THAN THAT I CANNOT SAY I DO NOT KNOW THE HISTORY OF WIZARDS THEY APPEARED FIRST AFTER THE GREAT SHIPS CAME OVER THE SEA BUT IF THEY CAME WITH THE SHIPS I NEVER CAN TELL SARUMAN WAS RECKONED GREAT AMONG THEM I BELIEVE HE GAVE UP WANDERING ABOUT AND MINDING THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND ELVES SOME TIME AGO  YOU WOULD CALL IT A VERY LONG TIME AGO AND HE SETTLED DOWN AT ANGRENOST OR ISENGARD AS THE MEN OF ROHAN CALL IT HE WAS VERY QUIET TO BEGIN WITH BUT HIS FAME BEGAN TO GROW HE WAS CHOSEN TO BE HEAD OF THE WHITE COUNCIL THEY SAY BUT THAT DID NOT TURN OUT TOO WELL I WONDER NOW IF EVEN THEN SARUMAN WAS NOT TURNING TO EVIL WAYS BUT AT ANY RATE HE USED TO GIVE NO TROUBLE TO HIS NEIGHBOURS I USED TO TALK TO HIM THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HE WAS ALWAYS WALKING ABOUT MY WOODS HE WAS POLITE IN THOSE DAYS ALWAYS ASKING MY LEAVE AT LEAST WHEN HE MET ME AND ALWAYS EAGER TO LISTEN I TOLD HIM MANY THINGS THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND OUT BY HIMSELF BUT HE NEVER REPAID ME IN LIKE KIND I CANNOT REMEMBER THAT HE EVER TOLD ME ANYTHING AND HE GOT MORE AND MORE LIKE THAT HIS FACE AS I REMEMBER IT  I HAVE NOT SEEN IT FOR MANY A DAY  BECAME LIKE WINDOWS IN A STONE WALL WINDOWS WITH SHUTTERS INSIDE
I THINK THAT I NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS UP TO HE IS PLOTTING TO BECOME A POWER HE HAS A MIND OF METAL AND WHEELS AND HE DOES NOT CARE FOR GROWING THINGS EXCEPT AS FAR AS THEY SERVE HIM FOR THE MOMENT AND NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT HE IS A BLACK TRAITOR HE HAS TAKEN UP WITH FOUL FOLK WITH THE ORCS BRM HOOM WORSE THAN THAT HE HAS BEEN DOING SOMETHING TO THEM SOMETHING DANGEROUS FOR THESE ISENGARDERS ARE MORE LIKE WICKED MEN IT IS A MARK OF EVIL THINGS THAT CAME IN THE GREAT DARKNESS THAT THEY CANNOT ABIDE THE SUN BUT SARUMANS ORCS CAN ENDURE IT EVEN IF THEY HATE IT I WONDER WHAT HE HAS DONE ARE THEY MEN HE HAS RUINED OR HAS HE BLENDED THE RACES OF ORCS AND MEN THAT WOULD BE A BLACK EVIL
TREEBEARD RUMBLED FOR A MOMENT AS IF HE WERE PRONOUNCING SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN ENTISH MALEDICTION SOME TIME AGO I BEGAN TO WONDER HOW ORCS DARED TO PASS THROUGH MY WOODS SO FREELY HE WENT ON ONLY LATELY DID I GUESS THAT SARUMAN WAS TO BLAME AND THAT LONG AGO HE HAD BEEN SPYING OUT ALL THE WAYS AND DISCOVERING MY SECRETS HE AND HIS FOUL FOLK ARE MAKING HAVOC NOW DOWN ON THE BORDERS THEY ARE FELLING TREES  GOOD TREES SOME OF THE TREES THEY JUST CUT DOWN AND LEAVE TO ROT  ORCMISCHIEF THAT BUT MOST ARE HEWN UP AND CARRIED OFF TO FEED THE FIRES OF ORTHANC THERE IS ALWAYS A SMOKE RISING FROM ISENGARD THESE DAYS
CURSE HIM ROOT AND BRANCH MANY OF THOSE TREES WERE MY FRIENDS CREATURES I HAD KNOWN FROM NUT AND ACORN MANY HAD VOICES OF THEIR OWN THAT ARE LOST FOR EVER NOW AND THERE ARE WASTES OF STUMP AND BRAMBLE WHERE ONCE THERE WERE SINGING GROVES I HAVE BEEN IDLE I HAVE LET THINGS SLIP IT MUST STOP
TREEBEARD RAISED HIMSELF FROM HIS BED WITH A JERK STOOD UP AND THUMPED HIS HAND ON THE TABLE THE VESSELS OF LIGHT TREMBLED AND SENT UP TWO JETS OF FLAME THERE WAS A FLICKER LIKE GREEN FIRE IN HIS EYES AND HIS BEARD STOOD OUT STIFF AS A GREAT BESOM
I WILL STOP IT HE BOOMED AND YOU SHALL COME WITH ME YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ME YOU WILL BE HELPING YOUR OWN FRIENDS THAT WAY TOO FOR IF SARUMAN IS NOT CHECKED ROHAN AND GONDOR WILL HAVE AN ENEMY BEHIND AS WELL AS IN FRONT OUR ROADS GO TOGETHER  TO ISENGARD
WE WILL COME WITH YOU SAID MERRY WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN
YES SAID PIPPIN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE WHITE HAND OVERTHROWN I SHOULD LIKE TO BE THERE EVEN IF I COULD NOT BE OF MUCH USE I SHALL NEVER FORGET UGLUK AND THE CROSSING OF ROHAN
GOOD GOOD SAID TREEBEARD BUT I SPOKE HASTILY WE MUST NOT BE HASTY I HAVE BECOME TOO HOT I MUST COOL MYSELF AND THINK FUR IT IS EASIER TO SHOUT STOP THAN TO DO IT
HE STRODE TO THE ARCHWAY AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME UNDER THE FALLING RAIN OF THE SPRING THEN HE LAUGHED AND SHOOK HIMSELF AND WHEREVER THE DROPS OF WATER FELL GLITTERING FROM HIM TO THE GROUND THEY GLINTED LIKE RED AND GREEN SPARKS HE CAME BACK AND LAID HIMSELF ON THE BED AGAIN AND WAS SILENT
AFTER SOME TIME THE HOBBITS HEARD HIM MURMURING AGAIN HE SEEMED TO BE COUNTING ON HIS FINGERS FANGORN FINGLAS FLADRIF AYE AYE HE SIGHED THE TROUBLE IS THAT THERE ARE SO FEW OF US LEFT HE SAID TURNING TOWARDS THE HOBBITS ONLY THREE REMAIN OF THE FIRST ENTS THAT WALKED IN THE WOODS BEFORE THE DARKNESS ONLY MYSELF FANGORN AND FINGLAS AND FLADRIF  TO GIVE THEM THEIR ELVISH NAMES YOU MAY CALL THEM LEAFLOCK AND SKINBARK IF YOU LIKE THAT BETTER AND OF US THREE LEAFLOCK AND SKINBARK ARE NOT MUCH USE FOR THIS BUSINESS LEAFLOCK HAS GROWN SLEEPY ALMOST TREEISH YOU MIGHT SAY HE HAS TAKEN TO STANDING BY HIMSELF HALFASLEEP ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER WITH THE DEEP GRASS OF THE MEADOWS ROUND HIS KNEES COVERED WITH LEAFY HAIR HE IS HE USED TO ROUSE UP IN WINTER BUT OF LATE HE HAS BEEN TOO DROWSY TO WALK FAR EVEN THEN SKINBARK LIVED ON THE MOUNTAINSLOPES WEST OF ISENGARD THAT IS WHERE THE WORST TROUBLE HAS BEEN HE WAS WOUNDED BY THE ORCS AND MANY OF HIS FOLK AND HIS TREEHERDS HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND DESTROYED HE HAS GONE UP INTO THE HIGH PLACES AMONG THE BIRCHES THAT HE LOVES BEST AND HE WILL NOT COME DOWN STILL I DARESAY I COULD GET TOGETHER A FAIR COMPANY OF OUR YOUNGER FOLKS  IF I COULD MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THE NEED IF I COULD ROUSE THEM WE ARE NOT A HASTY FOLK WHAT A PITY THERE ARE SO FEW OF US
WHY ARE THERE SO FEW WHEN YOU HAVE LIVED IN THIS COUNTRY SO LONG ASKED PIPPIN HAVE A GREAT MANY DIED
OH NO SAID TREEBEARD NONE HAVE DIED FROM INSIDE AS YOU MIGHT SAY SOME HAVE FALLEN IN THE EVIL CHANCES OF THE LONG YEARS OF COURSE AND MORE HAVE GROWN TREEISH BUT THERE WERE NEVER MANY OF US AND WE HAVE NOT INCREASED THERE HAVE BEEN NO ENTINGS  NO CHILDREN YOU WOULD SAY NOT FOR A TERRIBLE LONG COUNT OF YEARS YOU SEE WE LOST THE ENTWIVES
HOW VERY SAD SAID PIPPIN HOW WAS IT THAT THEY ALL DIED
THEY DID NOT DIE SAID TREEBEARD I NEVER SAID DIED WE LOST THEM I SAID WE LOST THEM AND WE CANNOT FIND THEM HE SIGHED I THOUGHT MOST FOLK KNEW THAT THERE WERE SONGS ABOUT THE HUNT OF THE ENTS FOR THE ENTWIVES SUNG AMONG ELVES AND MEN FROM MIRKWOOD TO GONDOR THEY CANNOT BE QUITE FORGOTTEN
WELL I AM AFRAID THE SONGS HAVE NOT COME WEST OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SHIRE SAID MERRY WONT YOU TELL US SOME MORE OR SING US ONE OF THE SONGS
YES I WILL INDEED SAID TREEBEARD SEEMING PLEASED WITH THE REQUEST BUT I CANNOT TELL IT PROPERLY ONLY IN SHORT AND THEN WE MUST END OUR TALK TOMORROW WE HAVE COUNCILS TO CALL AND WORK TO DO AND MAYBE A JOURNEY TO BEGIN
IT IS RATHER A STRANGE AND SAD STORY HE WENT ON AFTER A PAUSE WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG AND THE WOODS WERE WIDE AND WILD THE ENTS AND THE ENTWIVES  AND THERE WERE ENTMAIDENS THEN AH THE LOVELINESS OF FIMBRETHIL OF WANDLIMB THE LIGHTFOOTED IN THE DAYS OF OUR YOUTH  THEY WALKED TOGETHER AND THEY HOUSED TOGETHER BUT OUR HEARTS DID NOT GO ON GROWING IN THE SAME WAY THE ENTS GAVE THEIR LOVE TO THINGS THAT THEY MET IN THE WORLD AND THE ENTWIVES GAVE THEIR THOUGHT TO OTHER THINGS FOR THE ENTS LOVED THE GREAT TREES AND THE WILD WOODS AND THE SLOPES OF THE HIGH HILLS AND THEY DRANK OF THE MOUNTAINSTREAMS AND ATE ONLY SUCH FRUIT AS THE TREES LET FALL IN THEIR PATH AND THEY LEARNED OF THE ELVES AND SPOKE WITH THE TREES BUT THE ENTWIVES GAVE THEIR MINDS TO THE LESSER TREES AND TO THE MEADS IN THE SUNSHINE BEYOND THE FEET OF THE FORESTS AND THEY SAW THE SLOE IN THE THICKET AND THE WILD APPLE AND THE CHERRY BLOSSOMING IN SPRING AND THE GREEN HERBS IN THE WATERLANDS IN SUMMER AND THE SEEDING GRASSES IN THE AUTUMN FIELDS THEY DID NOT DESIRE TO SPEAK WITH THESE THINGS BUT THEY WISHED THEM TO HEAR AND OBEY WHAT WAS SAID TO THEM THE ENTWIVES ORDERED THEM TO GROW ACCORDING TO THEIR WISHES AND BEAR LEAF AND FRUIT TO THEIR LIKING FOR THE ENTWIVES DESIRED ORDER AND PLENTY AND PEACE BY WHICH THEY MEANT THAT THINGS SHOULD REMAIN WHERE THEY HAD SET THEM SO THE ENTWIVES MADE GARDENS TO LIVE IN BUT WE ENTS WENT ON WANDERING AND WE ONLY CAME TO THE GARDENS NOW AND AGAIN THEN WHEN THE DARKNESS CAME IN THE NORTH THE ENTWIVES CROSSED THE GREAT RIVER AND MADE NEW GARDENS AND TILLED NEW FIELDS AND WE SAW THEM MORE SELDOM AFTER THE DARKNESS WAS OVERTHROWN THE LAND OF THE ENTWIVES BLOSSOMED RICHLY AND THEIR FIELDS WERE FULL OF CORN MANY MEN LEARNED THE CRAFTS OF THE ENTWIVES AND HONOURED THEM GREATLY BUT WE WERE ONLY A LEGEND TO THEM A SECRET IN THE HEART OF THE FOREST YET HERE WE STILL ARE WHILE ALL THE GARDENS OF THE ENTWIVES ARE WASTED MEN CALL THEM THE BROWN LANDS NOW
I REMEMBER IT WAS LONG AGO  IN THE TIME OF THE WAR BETWEEN SAURON AND THE MEN OF THE SEA  DESIRE CAME OVER ME TO SEE FIMBRETHIL AGAIN VERY FAIR SHE WAS STILL IN MY EYES WHEN I HAD LAST SEEN HER THOUGH LITTLE LIKE THE ENTMAIDEN OF OLD FOR THE ENTWIVES WERE BENT AND BROWNED BY THEIR LABOUR THEIR HAIR PARCHED BY THE SUN TO THE HUE OF RIPE CORN AND THEIR CHEEKS LIKE RED APPLES YET THEIR EYES WERE STILL THE EYES OF OUR OWN PEOPLE WE CROSSED OVER ANDUIN AND CAME TO THEIR LAND BUT WE FOUND A DESERT IT WAS ALL BURNED AND UPROOTED FOR WAR HAD PASSED OVER IT BUT THE ENTWIVES WERE NOT THERE LONG WE CALLED AND LONG WE SEARCHED AND WE ASKED ALL FOLK THAT WE MET WHICH WAY THE ENTWIVES HAD GONE SOME SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THEM AND SOME SAID THAT THEY HAD SEEN THEM WALKING AWAY WEST AND SOME SAID EAST AND OTHERS SOUTH BUT NOWHERE THAT WE WENT COULD WE FIND THEM OUR SORROW WAS VERY GREAT YET THE WILD WOOD CALLED AND WE RETURNED TO IT FOR MANY YEARS WE USED TO GO OUT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN AND LOOK FOR THE ENTWIVES WALKING FAR AND WIDE AND CALLING THEM BY THEIR BEAUTIFUL NAMES BUT AS TIME PASSED WE WENT MORE SELDOM AND WANDERED LESS FAR AND NOW THE ENTWIVES ARE ONLY A MEMORY FOR US AND OUR BEARDS ARE LONG AND GREY THE ELVES MADE MANY SONGS CONCERNING THE SEARCH OF THE ENTS AND SOME OF THE SONGS PASSED INTO THE TONGUES OF MEN BUT WE MADE NO SONGS ABOUT IT BEING CONTENT TO CHANT THEIR BEAUTIFUL NAMES WHEN WE THOUGHT OF THE ENTWIVES WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY MEET AGAIN IN A TIME TO COME AND PERHAPS WE SHALL FIND SOMEWHERE A LAND WHERE WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER AND BOTH BE CONTENT BUT IT IS FOREBODED THAT THAT WILL ONLY BE WHEN WE HAVE BOTH LOST ALL THAT WE NOW HAVE AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT THAT TIME IS DRAWING NEAR AT LAST FOR IF SAURON OF OLD DESTROYED THE GARDENS THE ENEMY TODAY SEEMS LIKELY TO WITHER ALL THE WOODS
THERE WAS AN ELVISH SONG THAT SPOKE OF THIS OR AT LEAST SO I UNDERSTAND IT IT USED TO BE SUNG UP AND DOWN THE GREAT RIVER IT WAS NEVER AN ENTISH SONG MARK YOU IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY LONG SONG IN ENTISH BUT WE KNOW IT BY HEART AND HUM IT NOW AND AGAIN THIS IS HOW IT RUNS IN YOUR TONGUE

ENT
WHEN SPRING UNFOLDS THE BEECHEN LEAF AND SAP IS IN THE BOUGH
WHEN LIGHT IS ON THE WILDWOOD STREAM AND WIND IS ON THE BROW
WHEN STRIDE IS LONG AND BREATH IS DEEP AND KEEN THE MOUNTAINAIR
COME BACK TO ME COME BACK TO ME AND SAY MY LAND IS FAIR

ENTWIFE
WHEN SPRING IS COME TO GARTH AND FIELD AND CORN IS IN THE BLADE
WHEN BLOSSOM LIKE A SHINING SNOW IS ON THE ORCHARD LAID
WHEN SHOWER AND SUN UPON THE EARTH WITH FRAGRANCE FILL THE AIR
ILL LINGER HERE AND WILL NOT COME BECAUSE MY LAND IS FAIR

ENT
WHEN SUMMER LIES UPON THE WORLD AND IN A NOON OF GOLD
BENEATH THE ROOF OF SLEEPING LEAVES THE DREAMS OF TREES UNFOLD
WHEN WOODLAND HALLS ARE GREEN AND COOL AND WIND IS IN THE WEST
COME BACK TO ME COME BACK TO ME AND SAY MY LAND IS BEST

ENTWIFE
WHEN SUMMER WARMS THE HANGING FRUIT AND BURNS THE BERRY BROWN
WHEN STRAW IS GOLD AND EAR IS WHITE AND HARVEST COMES TO TOWN
WHEN HONEY SPILLS AND APPLE SWELLS THOUGH WIND BE IN THE WEST
ILL LINGER HERE BENEATH THE SUN BECAUSE MY LAND IS BEST

ENT
WHEN WINTER COMES THE WINTER WILD THAT HILL AND WOOD SHALL SLAY
WHEN TREES SHALL FALL AND STARLESS NIGHT DEVOUR THE SUNLESS DAY
WHEN WIND IS IN THE DEADLY EAST THEN IN THE BITTER RAIN
ILL LOOK FOR THEE AND CALL TO THEE ILL COME TO THEE AGAIN

ENTWIFE
WHEN WINTER COMES AND SINGING ENDS WHEN DARKNESS FALLS AT LAST
WHEN BROKEN IS THE BARREN BOUGH AND LIGHT AND LABOUR PAST
ILL LOOK FOR THEE AND WAIT FOR THEE UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN
TOGETHER WE WILL TAKE THE ROAD BENEATH THE BITTER RAIN

BOTH
TOGETHER WE WILL TAKE THE ROAD THAT LEADS INTO THE WEST
AND FAR AWAY WILL FIND A LAND WHERE BOTH OUR HEARTS MAY REST

TREEBEARD ENDED HIS SONG THAT IS HOW IT GOES HE SAID IT IS ELVISH OF COURSE LIGHTHEARTED QUICKWORDED AND SOON OVER I DARESAY IT IS FAIR ENOUGH BUT THE ENTS COULD SAY MORE ON THEIR SIDE IF THEY HAD TIME BUT NOW I AM GOING TO STAND UP AND TAKE A LITTLE SLEEP WHERE WILL YOU STAND
WE USUALLY LIE DOWN TO SLEEP SAID MERRY WE SHALL BE ALL RIGHT WHERE WE ARE
LIE DOWN TO SLEEP SAID TREEBEARD WHY OF COURSE YOU DO HM HOOM I WAS FORGETTING SINGING THAT SONG PUT ME IN MIND OF OLD TIMES ALMOST THOUGHT THAT I WAS TALKING TO YOUNG ENTINGS I DID WELL YOU CAN LIE ON THE BED I AM GOING TO STAND IN THE RAIN GOOD NIGHT
MERRY AND PIPPIN CLIMBED ON TO THE BED AND CURLED UP IN THE SOFT GRASS AND FERN IT WAS FRESH AND SWEETSCENTED AND WARM THE LIGHTS DIED DOWN AND THE GLOW OF THE TREES FADED BUT OUTSIDE UNDER THE ARCH THEY COULD SEE OLD TREEBEARD STANDING MOTIONLESS WITH HIS ARMS RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE BRIGHT STARS PEERED OUT OF THE SKY AND LIT THE FALLING WATER AS IT SPILLED ON TO HIS FINGERS AND HEAD AND DRIPPED DRIPPED IN HUNDREDS OF SILVER DROPS ON TO HIS FEET LISTENING TO THE TINKLING OF THE DROPS THE HOBBITS FELL ASLEEP
THEY WOKE TO FIND A COOL SUN SHINING INTO THE GREAT COURT AND ON TO THE FLOOR OF THE BAY SHREDS OF HIGH CLOUD WERE OVERHEAD RUNNING ON A STIFF EASTERLY WIND TREEBEARD WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT WHILE MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE BATHING IN THE BASIN BY THE ARCH THEY HEARD HIM HUMMING AND SINGING AS HE CAME UP THE PATH BETWEEN THE TREES
HOO HO GOOD MORNING MERRY AND PIPPIN HE BOOMED WHEN HE SAW THEM YOU SLEEP LONG I HAVE BEEN MANY A HUNDRED STRIDES ALREADY TODAY NOW WE WILL HAVE A DRINK AND GO TO ENTMOOT
HE POURED THEM OUT TWO FULL BOWLS FROM A STONE JAR BUT FROM A DIFFERENT JAR THE TASTE WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE IT WAS EARTHIER AND RICHER MORE SUSTAINING AND FOODLIKE SO TO SPEAK WHILE THE HOBBITS DRANK SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE BED AND NIBBLING SMALL PIECES OF ELFCAKE MORE BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT EATING WAS A NECESSARY PART OF BREAKFAST THAN BECAUSE THEY FELT HUNGRY TREEBEARD STOOD HUMMING IN ENTISH OR ELVISH OR SOME STRANGE TONGUE AND LOOKING UP AT THE SKY
WHERE IS ENTMOOT PIPPIN VENTURED TO ASK
HOO EH ENTMOOT SAID TREEBEARD TURNING ROUND IT IS NOT A PLACE IT IS A GATHERING OF ENTS  WHICH DOES NOT OFTEN HAPPEN NOWADAYS BUT I HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE A FAIR NUMBER PROMISE TO COME WE SHALL MEET IN THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE ALWAYS MET DERNDINGLE MEN CALL IT IT IS AWAY SOUTH FROM HERE WE MUST BE THERE BEFORE NOON
BEFORE LONG THEY SET OFF TREEBEARD CARRIED THE HOBBITS IN HIS ARMS AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE COURT HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT STEPPED OVER THE STREAM AND STRODE AWAY SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE FEET OF GREAT TUMBLED SLOPES WHERE TREES WERE SCANTY ABOVE THESE THE HOBBITS SAW THICKETS OF BIRCH AND ROWAN AND BEYOND THEM DARK CLIMBING PINEWOODS SOON TREEBEARD TURNED A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE HILLS AND PLUNGED INTO DEEP GROVES WHERE THE TREES WERE LARGER TALLER AND THICKER THAN ANY THAT THE HOBBITS HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE FOR A WHILE THEY FELT FAINTLY THE SENSE OF STIFLING WHICH THEY HAD NOTICED WHEN THEY FIRST VENTURED INTO FANGORN BUT IT SOON PASSED TREEBEARD DID NOT TALK TO THEM HE HUMMED TO HIMSELF DEEPLY AND THOUGHTFULLY BUT MERRY AND PIPPIN CAUGHT NO PROPER WORDS IT SOUNDED LIKE BOOM BOOM RUMBOOM BOORAR BOOM BOOM DAHRAR BOOM BOOM DAHRAR BOOM AND SO ON WITH A CONSTANT CHANGE OF NOTE AND RHYTHM NOW AND AGAIN THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD AN ANSWER A HUM OR A QUIVER OF SOUND THAT SEEMED TO COME OUT OF THE EARTH OR FROM BOUGHS ABOVE THEIR HEADS OR PERHAPS FROM THE BOLES OF THE TREES BUT TREEBEARD DID NOT STOP OR TURN HIS HEAD TO EITHER SIDE
THEY HAD BEEN GOING FOR A LONG WHILE  PIPPIN HAD TRIED TO KEEP COUNT OF THE ENTSTRIDES BUT HAD FAILED GETTING LOST AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND  WHEN TREEBEARD BEGAN TO SLACKEN HIS PACE SUDDENLY HE STOPPED PUT THE HOBBITS DOWN AND RAISED HIS CURLED HANDS TO HIS MOUTH SO THAT THEY MADE A HOLLOW TUBE THEN HE BLEW OR CALLED THROUGH THEM A GREAT HOOM HOM RANG OUT LIKE A DEEPTHROATED HORN IN THE WOODS AND SEEMED TO ECHO FROM THE TREES FAR OFF THERE CAME FROM SEVERAL DIRECTIONS A SIMILAR HOOM HOM HOOM THAT WAS NOT AN ECHO BUT AN ANSWER
TREEBEARD NOW PERCHED MERRY AND PIPPIN ON HIS SHOULDERS AND STRODE ON AGAIN EVERY NOW AND THEN SENDING OUT ANOTHER HORNCALL AND EACH TIME THE ANSWERS CAME LOUDER AND NEARER IN THIS WAY THEY CAME AT LAST TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN IMPENETRABLE WALL OF DARK EVERGREEN TREES TREES OF A KIND THAT THE HOBBITS HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE THEY BRANCHED OUT RIGHT FROM THE ROOTS AND WERE DENSELY CLAD IN DARK GLOSSY LEAVES LIKE THORNLESS HOLLY AND THEY BORE MANY STIFF UPRIGHT FLOWERSPIKES WITH LARGE SHINING OLIVECOLOURED BUDS
TURNING TO THE LEFT AND SKIRTING THIS HUGE HEDGE TREEBEARD CAME IN A FEW STRIDES TO A NARROW ENTRANCE THROUGH IT A WORN PATH PASSED AND DIVED SUDDENLY DOWN A LONG STEEP SLOPE THE HOBBITS SAW THAT THEY WERE DESCENDING INTO A GREAT DINGLE ALMOST AS ROUND AS A BOWL VERY WIDE AND DEEP CROWNED AT THE RIM WITH THE HIGH DARK EVERGREEN HEDGE IT WAS SMOOTH AND GRASSCLAD INSIDE AND THERE WERE NO TREES EXCEPT THREE VERY TALL AND BEAUTIFUL SILVERBIRCHES THAT STOOD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL TWO OTHER PATHS LED DOWN INTO THE DINGLE FROM THE WEST AND FROM THE EAST
SEVERAL ENTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED MORE WERE COMING IN DOWN THE OTHER PATHS AND SOME WERE NOW FOLLOWING TREEBEARD AS THEY DREW NEAR THE HOBBITS GAZED AT THEM THEY HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A NUMBER OF CREATURES AS MUCH LIKE TREEBEARD AS ONE HOBBIT IS LIKE ANOTHER AT ANY RATE TO A STRANGERS EYE AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE NOTHING OF THE KIND THE ENTS WERE AS DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER AS TREES FROM TREES SOME AS DIFFERENT AS ONE TREE IS FROM ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME BUT QUITE DIFFERENT GROWTH AND HISTORY AND SOME AS DIFFERENT AS ONE TREEKIND FROM ANOTHER AS BIRCH FROM BEECH OAK FROM FIR THERE WERE A FEW OLDER ENTS BEARDED AND GNARLED LIKE HALE BUT ANCIENT TREES THOUGH NONE LOOKED AS ANCIENT AS TREEBEARD AND THERE WERE TALL STRONG ENTS CLEANLIMBED AND SMOOTHSKINNED LIKE FORESTTREES IN THEIR PRIME BUT THERE WERE NO YOUNG ENTS NO SAPLINGS ALTOGETHER THERE WERE ABOUT TWO DOZEN STANDING ON THE WIDE GRASSY FLOOR OF THE DINGLE AND AS MANY MORE WERE MARCHING IN
AT FIRST MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE STRUCK CHIEFLY BY THE VARIETY THAT THEY SAW THE MANY SHAPES AND COLOURS THE DIFFERENCES IN GIRTH AND HEIGHT AND LENGTH OF LEG AND ARM AND IN THE NUMBER OF TOES AND FINGERS ANYTHING FROM THREE TO NINE A FEW SEEMED MORE OR LESS RELATED TO TREEBEARD AND REMINDED THEM OF BEECHTREES OR OAKS BUT THERE WERE OTHER KINDS SOME RECALLED THE CHESTNUT BROWNSKINNED ENTS WITH LARGE SPLAYFINGERED HANDS AND SHORT THICK LEGS SOME RECALLED THE ASH TALL STRAIGHT GREY ENTS WITH MANYFINGERED HANDS AND LONG LEGS SOME THE FIR THE TALLEST ENTS AND OTHERS THE BIRCH THE ROWAN AND THE LINDEN BUT WHEN THE ENTS ALL GATHERED ROUND TREEBEARD BOWING THEIR HEADS SLIGHTLY MURMURING IN THEIR SLOW MUSICAL VOICES AND LOOKING LONG AND INTENTLY AT THE STRANGERS THEN THE HOBBITS SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL OF THE SAME KINDRED AND ALL HAD THE SAME EYES NOT ALL SO OLD OR SO DEEP AS TREEBEARDS BUT ALL WITH THE SAME SLOW STEADY THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSION AND THE SAME GREEN FLICKER
AS SOON AS THE WHOLE COMPANY WAS ASSEMBLED STANDING IN A WIDE CIRCLE ROUND TREEBEARD A CURIOUS AND UNINTELLIGIBLE CONVERSATION BEGAN THE ENTS BEGAN TO MURMUR SLOWLY FIRST ONE JOINED AND THEN ANOTHER UNTIL THEY WERE ALL CHANTING TOGETHER IN A LONG RISING AND FALLING RHYTHM NOW LOUDER ON ONE SIDE OF THE RING NOW DYING AWAY THERE AND RISING TO A GREAT BOOM ON THE OTHER SIDE THOUGH HE COULD NOT CATCH OR UNDERSTAND ANY OF THE WORDS  HE SUPPOSED THE LANGUAGE WAS ENTISH  PIPPIN FOUND THE SOUND VERY PLEASANT TO LISTEN TO AT FIRST BUT GRADUALLY HIS ATTENTION WAVERED AFTER A LONG TIME AND THE CHANT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF SLACKENING HE FOUND HIMSELF WONDERING SINCE ENTISH WAS SUCH AN UNHASTY LANGUAGE WHETHER THEY HAD YET GOT FURTHER THAN GOOD MORNING AND IF TREEBEARD WAS TO CALL THE ROLL HOW MANY DAYS IT WOULD TAKE TO SING ALL THEIR NAMES I WONDER WHAT THE ENTISH IS FOR YES OR NO HE THOUGHT HE YAWNED
TREEBEARD WAS IMMEDIATELY AWARE OF HIM HM HA HEY MY PIPPIN HE SAID AND THE OTHER ENTS ALL STOPPED THEIR CHANT YOU ARE A HASTY FOLK I WAS FORGETTING AND ANYWAY IT IS WEARISOME LISTENING TO A SPEECH YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU MAY GET DOWN NOW I HAVE TOLD YOUR NAMES TO THE ENTMOOT AND THEY HAVE SEEN YOU AND THEY HAVE AGREED THAT YOU ARE NOT ORCS AND THAT A NEW LINE SHALL BE PUT IN THE OLD LISTS WE HAVE GOT NO FURTHER YET BUT THAT IS QUICK WORK FOR AN ENTMOOT YOU AND MERRY CAN STROLL ABOUT IN THE DINGLE IF YOU LIKE THERE IS A WELL OF GOOD WATER IF YOU NEED REFRESHING AWAY YONDER IN THE NORTH BANK THERE ARE STILL SOME WORDS TO SPEAK BEFORE THE MOOT REALLY BEGINS I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN AND TELL YOU HOW THINGS ARE GOING
HE PUT THE HOBBITS DOWN BEFORE THEY WALKED AWAY THEY BOWED LOW THIS FEAT SEEMED TO AMUSE THE ENTS VERY MUCH TO JUDGE BY THE TONE OF THEIR MURMURS AND THE FLICKER OF THEIR EYES BUT THEY SOON TURNED BACK TO THEIR OWN BUSINESS MERRY AND PIPPIN CLIMBED UP THE PATH THAT CAME IN FROM THE WEST AND LOOKED THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE GREAT HEDGE LONG TREECLAD SLOPES ROSE FROM THE LIP OF THE DINGLE AND AWAY BEYOND THEM ABOVE THE FIRTREES OF THE FURTHEST RIDGE THERE ROSE SHARP AND WHITE THE PEAK OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN SOUTHWARDS TO THEIR LEFT THEY COULD SEE THE FOREST FALLING AWAY DOWN INTO THE GREY DISTANCE THERE FAR AWAY THERE WAS A PALE GREEN GLIMMER THAT MERRY GUESSED TO BE A GLIMPSE OF THE PLAINS OF ROHAN
I WONDER WHERE ISENGARD IS SAID PIPPIN
I DONT KNOW QUITE WHERE WE ARE SAID MERRY BUT THAT PEAK IS PROBABLY METHEDRAS AND AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER THE RING OF ISENGARD LIES IN A FORK OR DEEP CLEFT AT THE END OF THE MOUNTAINS IT IS PROBABLY DOWN BEHIND THIS GREAT RIDGE THERE SEEMS TO BE A SMOKE OR HAZE OVER THERE LEFT OF THE PEAK DONT YOU THINK
WHAT IS ISENGARD LIKE SAID PIPPIN I WONDER WHAT ENTS CAN DO ABOUT IT ANYWAY
SO DO I SAID MERRY ISENGARD IS A SORT OF RING OF ROCKS OR HILLS I THINK WITH A FLAT SPACE INSIDE AND AN ISLAND OR PILLAR OF ROCK IN THE MIDDLE CALLED ORTHANC SARUMAN HAS A TOWER ON IT THERE IS A GATE PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE IN THE ENCIRCLING WALL AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A STREAM RUNNING THROUGH IT IT COMES OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND FLOWS ON ACROSS THE GAP OF ROHAN IT DOES NOT SEEM THE SORT OF PLACE FOR ENTS TO TACKLE BUT I HAVE AN ODD FEELING ABOUT THESE ENTS SOMEHOW I DONT THINK THEY ARE QUITE AS SAFE AND WELL FUNNY AS THEY SEEM THEY SEEM SLOW QUEER AND PATIENT ALMOST SAD AND YET I BELIEVE THEY COULD BE ROUSED IF THAT HAPPENED I WOULD RATHER NOT BE ON THE OTHER SIDE
YES SAID PIPPIN I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN THERE MIGHT BE ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN OLD COW SITTING AND THOUGHTFULLY CHEWING AND A BULL CHARGING AND THE CHANGE MIGHT COME SUDDENLY I WONDER IF TREEBEARD WILL ROUSE THEM I AM SURE HE MEANS TO TRY BUT THEY DONT LIKE BEING ROUSED TREEBEARD GOT ROUSED HIMSELF LAST NIGHT AND THEN BOTTLED IT UP AGAIN
THE HOBBITS TURNED BACK THE VOICES OF THE ENTS WERE STILL RISING AND FALLING IN THEIR CONCLAVE THE SUN HAD NOW RISEN HIGH ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER THE HIGH HEDGE IT GLEAMED ON THE TOPS OF THE BIRCHES AND LIT THE NORTHWARD SIDE OF THE DINGLE WITH A COOL YELLOW LIGHT THERE THEY SAW A LITTLE GLITTERING FOUNTAIN THEY WALKED ALONG THE RIM OF THE GREAT BOWL AT THE FEET OF THE EVERGREENS  IT WAS PLEASANT TO FEEL COOL GRASS ABOUT THEIR TOES AGAIN AND NOT TO BE IN A HURRY  AND THEN THEY CLIMBED DOWN TO THE GUSHING WATER THEY DRANK A LITTLE A CLEAN COLD SHARP DRAUGHT AND SAT DOWN ON A MOSSY STONE WATCHING THE PATCHES OF SUN ON THE GRASS AND THE SHADOWS OF THE SAILING CLOUDS PASSING OVER THE FLOOR OF THE DINGLE THE MURMUR OF THE ENTS WENT ON IT SEEMED A VERY STRANGE AND REMOTE PLACE OUTSIDE THEIR WORLD AND FAR FROM EVERYTHING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO THEM A GREAT LONGING CAME OVER THEM FOR THE FACES AND VOICES OF THEIR COMPANIONS ESPECIALLY FOR FRODO AND SAM AND FOR STRIDER
AT LAST THERE CAME A PAUSE IN THE ENTVOICES AND LOOKING UP THEY SAW TREEBEARD COMING TOWARDS THEM WITH ANOTHER ENT AT HIS SIDE
HM HOOM HERE I AM AGAIN SAID TREEBEARD ARE YOU GETTING WEARY OR FEELING IMPATIENT HMM EH WELL I AM AFRAID THAT YOU MUST NOT GET IMPATIENT YET WE HAVE FINISHED THE FIRST STAGE NOW BUT I HAVE STILL GOT TO EXPLAIN THINGS AGAIN TO THOSE THAT LIVE A LONG WAY OFF FAR FROM ISENGARD AND THOSE THAT I COULD NOT GET ROUND TO BEFORE THE MOOT AND AFTER THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO HOWEVER DECIDING WHAT TO DO DOES NOT TAKE ENTS SO LONG AS GOING OVER ALL THE FACTS AND EVENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS ABOUT STILL IT IS NO USE DENYING WE SHALL BE HERE A LONG TIME YET A COUPLE OF DAYS VERY LIKELY SO I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A COMPANION HE HAS AN ENTHOUSE NEARBY BREGALAD IS HIS ELVISH NAME HE SAYS HE HAS ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND AND DOES NOT NEED TO REMAIN AT THE MOOT HM HM HE IS THE NEAREST THING AMONG US TO A HASTY ENT YOU OUGHT TO GET ON TOGETHER GOODBYE TREEBEARD TURNED AND LEFT THEM
BREGALAD STOOD FOR SOME TIME SURVEYING THE HOBBITS SOLEMNLY AND THEY LOOKED AT HIM WONDERING WHEN HE WOULD SHOW ANY SIGNS OF HASTINESS HE WAS TALL AND SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THE YOUNGER ENTS HE HAD SMOOTH SHINING SKIN ON HIS ARMS AND LEGS HIS LIPS WERE RUDDY AND HIS HAIR WAS GREYGREEN HE COULD BEND AND SWAY LIKE A SLENDER TREE IN THE WIND AT LAST HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE THOUGH RESONANT WAS HIGHER AND CLEARER THAN TREEBEARDS
HA HMM MY FRIENDS LET US GO FOR A WALK HE SAID I AM BREGALAD THAT IS QUICKBEAM IN YOUR LANGUAGE BUT IT IS ONLY A NICKNAME OF COURSE THEY HAVE CALLED ME THAT EVER SINCE I SAID YES TO AN ELDER ENT BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED HIS QUESTION ALSO I DRINK QUICKLY AND GO OUT WHILE SOME ARE STILL WETTING THEIR BEARDS COME WITH ME
HE REACHED DOWN TWO SHAPELY ARMS AND GAVE A LONGFINGERED HAND TO EACH OF THE HOBBITS ALL THAT DAY THEY WALKED ABOUT IN THE WOODS WITH HIM SINGING AND LAUGHING FOR QUICKBEAM OFTEN LAUGHED HE LAUGHED IF THE SUN CAME OUT FROM BEHIND A CLOUD HE LAUGHED IF THEY CAME UPON A STREAM OR SPRING THEN HE STOOPED AND SPLASHED HIS FEET AND HEAD WITH WATER HE LAUGHED SOMETIMES AT SOME SOUND OR WHISPER IN THE TREES WHENEVER HE SAW A ROWANTREE HE HALTED A WHILE WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT AND SANG AND SWAYED AS HE SANG
AT NIGHTFALL HE BROUGHT THEM TO HIS ENTHOUSE NOTHING MORE THAN A MOSSY STONE SET UPON TURVES UNDER A GREEN BANK ROWANTREES GREW IN A CIRCLE ABOUT IT AND THERE WAS WATER AS IN ALL ENTHOUSES A SPRING BUBBLING OUT FROM THE BANK THEY TALKED FOR A WHILE AS DARKNESS FELL ON THE FOREST NOT FAR AWAY THE VOICES OF THE ENTMOOT COULD BE HEARD STILL GOING ON BUT NOW THEY SEEMED DEEPER AND LESS LEISURELY AND EVERY NOW AND AGAIN ONE GREAT VOICE WOULD RISE IN A HIGH AND QUICKENING MUSIC WHILE ALL THE OTHERS DIED AWAY BUT BESIDE THEM BREGALAD SPOKE GENTLY IN THEIR OWN TONGUE ALMOST WHISPERING AND THEY LEARNED THAT HE BELONGED TO SKINBARKS PEOPLE AND THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD LIVED HAD BEEN RAVAGED THAT SEEMED TO THE HOBBITS QUITE ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN HIS HASTINESS AT LEAST IN THE MATTER OF ORCS
THERE WERE ROWANTREES IN MY HOME SAID BREGALAD SOFTLY AND SADLY ROWANTREES THAT TOOK ROOT WHEN I WAS AN ENTING MANY MANY YEARS AGO IN THE QUIET OF THE WORLD THE OLDEST WERE PLANTED BY THE ENTS TO TRY AND PLEASE THE ENTWIVES BUT THEY LOOKED AT THEM AND SMILED AND SAID THAT THEY KNEW WHERE WHITER BLOSSOM AND RICHER FRUIT WERE GROWING YET THERE ARE NO TREES OF ALL THAT RACE THE PEOPLE OF THE ROSE THAT ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME AND THESE TREES GREW AND GREW TILL THE SHADOW OF EACH WAS LIKE A GREEN HALL AND THEIR RED BERRIES IN THE AUTUMN WERE A BURDEN AND A BEAUTY AND A WONDER BIRDS USED TO FLOCK THERE I LIKE BIRDS EVEN WHEN THEY CHATTER AND THE ROWAN HAS ENOUGH AND TO SPARE BUT THE BIRDS BECAME UNFRIENDLY AND GREEDY AND TORE AT THE TREES AND THREW THE FRUIT DOWN AND DID NOT EAT IT THEN ORCS CAME WITH AXES AND CUT DOWN MY TREES I CAME AND CALLED THEM BY THEIR LONG NAMES BUT THEY DID NOT QUIVER THEY DID NOT HEAR OR ANSWER THEY LAY DEAD

O OROFARNE LASSEMISTA CARNIMIRIE

THE HOBBITS FELL ASLEEP TO THE SOUND OF THE SOFT SINGING OF BREGALAD THAT SEEMED TO LAMENT IN MANY TONGUES THE FALL OF TREES THAT HE HAD LOVED
THE NEXT DAY THEY SPENT ALSO IN HIS COMPANY BUT THEY DID NOT GO FAR FROM HIS HOUSE MOST OF THE TIME THEY SAT SILENT UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE BANK FOR THE WIND WAS COLDER AND THE CLOUDS CLOSER AND GREYER THERE WAS LITTLE SUNSHINE AND IN THE DISTANCE THE VOICES OF THE ENTS AT THE MOOT STILL ROSE AND FELL SOMETIMES LOUD AND STRONG SOMETIMES LOW AND SAD SOMETIMES QUICKENING SOMETIMES SLOW AND SOLEMN AS A DIRGE A SECOND NIGHT CAME AND STILL THE ENTS HELD CONCLAVE UNDER HURRYING CLOUDS AND FITFUL STARS
THE THIRD DAY BROKE BLEAK AND WINDY AT SUNRISE THE ENTS VOICES ROSE TO A GREAT CLAMOUR AND THEN DIED DOWN AGAIN AS THE MORNING WORE ON THE WIND FELL AND THE AIR GREW HEAVY WITH EXPECTANCY THE HOBBITS COULD SEE THAT BREGALAD WAS NOW LISTENING INTENTLY ALTHOUGH TO THEM DOWN IN THE DELL OF HIS ENTHOUSE THE SOUND OF THE MOOT WAS FAINT
THE AFTERNOON CAME AND THE SUN GOING WEST TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS SENT OUT LONG YELLOW BEAMS BETWEEN THE CRACKS AND FISSURES OF THE CLOUDS SUDDENLY THEY WERE AWARE THAT EVERYTHING WAS VERY QUIET THE WHOLE FOREST STOOD IN LISTENING SILENCE OF COURSE THE ENTVOICES HAD STOPPED WHAT DID THAT MEAN BREGALAD WAS STANDING UP ERECT AND TENSE LOOKING BACK NORTHWARDS TOWARDS DERNDINGLE
THEN WITH A CRASH CAME A GREAT RINGING SHOUT RAHOOMRAH THE TREES QUIVERED AND BENT AS IF A GUST HAD STRUCK THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE AND THEN A MARCHING MUSIC BEGAN LIKE SOLEMN DRUMS AND ABOVE THE ROLLING BEATS AND BOOMS THERE WELLED VOICES SINGING HIGH AND STRONG
WE COME WE COME WITH ROLL OF DRUM TARUNDA RUNDA RUNDA ROM

THE ENTS WERE COMING EVER NEARER AND LOUDER ROSE THEIR SONG
WE COME WE COME WITH HORN AND DRUM TARUNA RUNA RUNA ROM

BREGALAD PICKED UP THE HOBBITS AND STRODE FROM HIS HOUSE
BEFORE LONG THEY SAW THE MARCHING LINE APPROACHING THE ENTS WERE SWINGING ALONG WITH GREAT STRIDES DOWN THE SLOPE TOWARDS THEM TREEBEARD WAS AT THEIR HEAD AND SOME FIFTY FOLLOWERS WERE BEHIND HIM TWO ABREAST KEEPING STEP WITH THEIR FEET AND BEATING TIME WITH THEIR HANDS UPON THEIR FLANKS AS THEY DREW NEAR THE FLASH AND FLICKER OF THEIR EYES COULD BE SEEN
HOOM HOM HERE WE COME WITH A BOOM HERE WE COME AT LAST CALLED TREEBEARD WHEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF BREGALAD AND THE HOBBITS COME JOIN THE MOOT WE ARE OFF WE ARE OFF TO ISENGARD
TO ISENGARD THE ENTS CRIED IN MANY VOICES
TO ISENGARD
TO ISENGARD THOUGH ISENGARD BE RINGED AND BARRED WITH DOORS OF STONE
THOUGH ISENGARD BE STRONG AND HARD AS COLD AS STONE AND BARE AS BONE
WE GO WE GO WE GO TO WAR TO HEW THE STONE AND BREAK THE DOOR
FOR BOLE AND BOUGH ARE BURNING NOW THE FURNACE ROARS  WE GO TO WAR
TO LAND OF GLOOM WITH TRAMP OF DOOM WITH ROLL OF DRUM WE COME WE COME
TO ISENGARD WITH DOOM WE COME
WITH DOOM WE COME WITH DOOM WE COME

SO THEY SANG AS THEY MARCHED SOUTHWARDS
BREGALAD HIS EYES SHINING SWUNG INTO THE LINE BESIDE TREEBEARD THE OLD ENT NOW TOOK THE HOBBITS BACK AND SET THEM ON HIS SHOULDERS AGAIN AND SO THEY RODE PROUDLY AT THE HEAD OF THE SINGING COMPANY WITH BEATING HEARTS AND HEADS HELD HIGH THOUGH THEY HAD EXPECTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY THEY WERE AMAZED AT THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME OVER THE ENTS IT SEEMED NOW AS SUDDEN AS THE BURSTING OF A FLOOD THAT HAD LONG BEEN HELD BACK BY A DIKE
THE ENTS MADE UP THEIR MINDS RATHER QUICKLY AFTER ALL DIDNT THEY PIPPIN VENTURED TO SAY AFTER SOME TIME WHEN FOR A MOMENT THE SINGING PAUSED AND ONLY THE BEATING OF HANDS AND FEET WAS HEARD
QUICKLY SAID TREEBEARD HOOM YES INDEED QUICKER THAN I EXPECTED INDEED I HAVE NOT SEEN THEM ROUSED LIKE THIS FOR MANY AN AGE WE ENTS DO NOT LIKE BEING ROUSED AND WE NEVER ARE ROUSED UNLESS IT IS CLEAR TO US THAT OUR TREES AND OUR LIVES ARE IN GREAT DANGER THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN THIS FOREST SINCE THE WARS OF SAURON AND THE MEN OF THE SEA IT IS THE ORCWORK THE WANTON HEWING  RARUM  WITHOUT EVEN THE BAD EXCUSE OF FEEDING THE FIRES THAT HAS SO ANGERED US AND THE TREACHERY OF A NEIGHBOUR WHO SHOULD HAVE HELPED US WIZARDS OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THEY DO KNOW BETTER THERE IS NO CURSE IN ELVISH ENTISH OR THE TONGUES OF MEN BAD ENOUGH FOR SUCH TREACHERY DOWN WITH SARUMAN
WILL YOU REALLY BREAK THE DOORS OF ISENGARD ASKED MERRY
HO HM WELL WE COULD YOU KNOW YOU DO NOT KNOW PERHAPS HOW STRONG WE ARE MAYBE YOU HAVE HEARD OF TROLLS THEY ARE MIGHTY STRONG BUT TROLLS ARE ONLY COUNTERFEITS MADE BY THE ENEMY IN THE GREAT DARKNESS IN MOCKERY OF ENTS AS ORCS WERE OF ELVES WE ARE STRONGER THAN TROLLS WE ARE MADE OF THE BONES OF THE EARTH WE CAN SPLIT STONE LIKE THE ROOTS OF TREES ONLY QUICKER FAR QUICKER IF OUR MINDS ARE ROUSED IF WE ARE NOT HEWN DOWN OR DESTROYED BY FIRE OR BLAST OF SORCERY WE COULD SPLIT ISENGARD INTO SPLINTERS AND CRACK ITS WALLS INTO RUBBLE
BUT SARUMAN WILL TRY TO STOP YOU WONT HE
HM AH YES THAT IS SO I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN IT INDEED I HAVE THOUGHT LONG ABOUT IT BUT YOU SEE MANY OF THE ENTS ARE YOUNGER THAN I AM BY MANY LIVES OF TREES THEY ARE ALL ROUSED NOW AND THEIR MIND IS ALL ON ONE THING BREAKING ISENGARD BUT THEY WILL START THINKING AGAIN BEFORE LONG THEY WILL COOL DOWN A LITTLE WHEN WE TAKE OUR EVENING DRINK WHAT A THIRST WE SHALL HAVE BUT LET THEM MARCH NOW AND SING WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND THERE IS TIME AHEAD FOR THOUGHT IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE STARTED
TREEBEARD MARCHED ON SINGING WITH THE OTHERS FOR A WHILE BUT AFTER A TIME HIS VOICE DIED TO A MURMUR AND FELL SILENT AGAIN PIPPIN COULD SEE THAT HIS OLD BROW WAS WRINKLED AND KNOTTED AT LAST HE LOOKED UP AND PIPPIN COULD SEE A SAD LOOK IN HIS EYES SAD BUT NOT UNHAPPY THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THEM AS IF THE GREEN FLAME HAD SUNK DEEPER INTO THE DARK WELLS OF HIS THOUGHT
OF COURSE IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH MY FRIENDS HE SAID SLOWLY LIKELY ENOUGH THAT WE ARE GOING TO OUR DOOM THE LAST MARCH OF THE ENTS BUT IF WE STAYED AT HOME AND DID NOTHING DOOM WOULD FIND US ANYWAY SOONER OR LATER THAT THOUGHT HAS LONG BEEN GROWING IN OUR HEARTS AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE MARCHING NOW IT WAS NOT A HASTY RESOLVE NOW AT LEAST THE LAST MARCH OF THE ENTS MAY BE WORTH A SONG AYE HE SIGHED WE MAY HELP THE OTHER PEOPLES BEFORE WE PASS AWAY STILL I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THE SONGS COME TRUE ABOUT THE ENTWIVES I SHOULD DEARLY HAVE LIKED TO SEE FIMBRETHIL AGAIN BUT THERE MY FRIENDS SONGS LIKE TREES BEAR FRUIT ONLY IN THEIR OWN TIME AND THEIR OWN WAY AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE WITHERED UNTIMELY
THE ENTS WENT STRIDING ON AT A GREAT PACE THEY HAD DESCENDED INTO A LONG FOLD OF THE LAND THAT FELL AWAY SOUTHWARD NOW THEY BEGAN TO CLIMB UP AND UP ON TO THE HIGH WESTERN RIDGE THE WOODS FELL AWAY AND THEY CAME TO SCATTERED GROUPS OF BIRCH AND THEN TO BARE SLOPES WHERE ONLY A FEW GAUNT PINETREES GREW THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE DARK HILLBACK IN FRONT GREY DUSK FELL
PIPPIN LOOKED BEHIND THE NUMBER OF THE ENTS HAD GROWN  OR WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHERE THE DIM BARE SLOPES THAT THEY HAD CROSSED SHOULD LIE HE THOUGHT HE SAW GROVES OF TREES BUT THEY WERE MOVING COULD IT BE THAT THE TREES OF FANGORN WERE AWAKE AND THE FOREST WAS RISING MARCHING OVER THE HILLS TO WAR HE RUBBED HIS EYES WONDERING IF SLEEP AND SHADOW HAD DECEIVED HIM BUT THE GREAT GREY SHAPES MOVED STEADILY ONWARD THERE WAS A NOISE LIKE WIND IN MANY BRANCHES THE ENTS WERE DRAWING NEAR THE CREST OF THE RIDGE NOW AND ALL SONG HAD CEASED NIGHT FELL AND THERE WAS SILENCE NOTHING WAS TO BE HEARD SAVE A FAINT QUIVER OF THE EARTH BENEATH THE FEET OF THE ENTS AND A RUSTLE THE SHADE OF A WHISPER AS OF MANY DRIFTING LEAVES AT LAST THEY STOOD UPON THE SUMMIT AND LOOKED DOWN INTO A DARK PIT THE GREAT CLEFT AT THE END OF THE MOUNTAINS NAN CURUNIR THE VALLEY OF SARUMAN
NIGHT LIES OVER ISENGARD SAID TREEBEARD



CHAPTER 5
THE WHITE RIDER

MY VERY BONES ARE CHILLED SAID GIMLI FLAPPING HIS ARMS AND STAMPING HIS FEET DAY HAD COME AT LAST AT DAWN THE COMPANIONS HAD MADE SUCH BREAKFAST AS THEY COULD NOW IN THE GROWING LIGHT THEY WERE GETTING READY TO SEARCH THE GROUND AGAIN FOR SIGNS OF THE HOBBITS
AND DO NOT FORGET THAT OLD MAN SAID GIMLI I SHOULD BE HAPPIER IF I COULD SEE THE PRINT OF A BOOT
WHY WOULD THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY SAID LEGOLAS
BECAUSE AN OLD MAN WITH FEET THAT LEAVE MARKS MIGHT BE NO MORE THAN HE SEEMED ANSWERED THE DWARF
MAYBE SAID THE ELF BUT A HEAVY BOOT MIGHT LEAVE NO PRINT HERE THE GRASS IS DEEP AND SPRINGY
THAT WOULD NOT BAFFLE A RANGER SAID GIMLI A BENT BLADE IS ENOUGH FOR ARAGORN TO READ BUT I DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO FIND ANY TRACES IT WAS AN EVIL PHANTOM OF SARUMAN THAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT I AM SURE OF IT EVEN UNDER THE LIGHT OF MORNING HIS EYES ARE LOOKING OUT ON US FROM FANGORN EVEN NOW MAYBE
IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH SAID ARAGORN YET I AM NOT SURE I AM THINKING OF THE HORSES YOU SAID LAST NIGHT GIMLI THAT THEY WERE SCARED AWAY BUT I DID NOT THINK SO DID YOU HEAR THEM LEGOLAS DID THEY SOUND TO YOU LIKE BEASTS IN TERROR
NO SAID LEGOLAS I HEARD THEM CLEARLY BUT FOR THE DARKNESS AND OUR OWN FEAR I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT THEY WERE BEASTS WILD WITH SOME SUDDEN GLADNESS THEY SPOKE AS HORSES WILL WHEN THEY MEET A FRIEND THAT THEY HAVE LONG MISSED
SO I THOUGHT SAID ARAGORN BUT I CANNOT READ THE RIDDLE UNLESS THEY RETURN COME THE LIGHT IS GROWING FAST LET US LOOK FIRST AND GUESS LATER WE SHOULD BEGIN HERE NEAR TO OUR OWN CAMPINGGROUND SEARCHING CAREFULLY ALL ABOUT AND WORKING UP THE SLOPE TOWARDS THE FOREST TO FIND THE HOBBITS IS OUR ERRAND WHATEVER WE MAY THINK OF OUR VISITOR IN THE NIGHT IF THEY ESCAPED BY SOME CHANCE THEN THEY MUST HAVE HIDDEN IN THE TREES OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN IF WE FIND NOTHING BETWEEN HERE AND THE EAVES OF THE WOOD THEN WE WILL MAKE A LAST SEARCH UPON THE BATTLEFIELD AND AMONG THE ASHES BUT THERE IS LITTLE HOPE THERE THE HORSEMEN OF ROHAN DID THEIR WORK TOO WELL
FOR SOME TIME THE COMPANIONS CRAWLED AND GROPED UPON THE GROUND THE TREE STOOD MOURNFULLY ABOVE THEM ITS DRY LEAVES NOW HANGING LIMP AND RATTLING IN THE CHILL EASTERLY WIND ARAGORN MOVED SLOWLY AWAY HE CAME TO THE ASHES OF THE WATCHFIRE NEAR THE RIVERBANK AND THEN BEGAN TO RETRACE THE GROUND BACK TOWARDS THE KNOLL WHERE THE BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT SUDDENLY HE STOOPED AND BENT LOW WITH HIS FACE ALMOST IN THE GRASS THEN HE CALLED TO THE OTHERS THEY CAME RUNNING UP
HERE AT LAST WE FIND NEWS SAID ARAGORN HE LIFTED UP A BROKEN LEAF FOR THEM TO SEE A LARGE PALE LEAF OF GOLDEN HUE NOW FADING AND TURNING BROWN HERE IS A MALLORNLEAF OF LORIEN AND THERE ARE SMALL CRUMBS ON IT AND A FEW MORE CRUMBS IN THE GRASS AND SEE THERE ARE SOME PIECES OF CUT CORD LYING NEARBY
AND HERE IS THE KNIFE THAT CUT THEM SAID GIMLI HE STOOPED AND DREW OUT OF A TUSSOCK INTO WHICH SOME HEAVY FOOT HAD TRAMPLED IT A SHORT JAGGED BLADE THE HAFT FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN SNAPPED WAS BESIDE IT IT WAS AN ORCWEAPON HE SAID HOLDING IT GINGERLY AND LOOKING WITH DISGUST AT THE CARVED HANDLE IT HAD BEEN SHAPED LIKE A HIDEOUS HEAD WITH SQUINTING EYES AND LEERING MOUTH
WELL HERE IS THE STRANGEST RIDDLE THAT WE HAVE YET FOUND EXCLAIMED LEGOLAS A BOUND PRISONER ESCAPES BOTH FROM THE ORCS AND FROM THE SURROUNDING HORSEMEN HE THEN STOPS WHILE STILL IN THE OPEN AND CUTS HIS BONDS WITH AN ORCKNIFE BUT HOW AND WHY FOR IF HIS LEGS WERE TIED HOW DID HE WALK AND IF HIS ARMS WERE TIED HOW DID HE USE THE KNIFE AND IF NEITHER WERE TIED WHY DID HE CUT THE CORDS AT ALL BEING PLEASED WITH HIS SKILL HE THEN SAT DOWN AND QUIETLY ATE SOME WAYBREAD THAT AT LEAST IS ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT HE WAS A HOBBIT WITHOUT THE MALLORNLEAF AFTER THAT I SUPPOSE HE TURNED HIS ARMS INTO WINGS AND FLEW AWAY SINGING INTO THE TREES IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND HIM WE ONLY NEED WINGS OURSELVES
THERE WAS SORCERY HERE RIGHT ENOUGH SAID GIMLI WHAT WAS THAT OLD MAN DOING WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY ARAGORN TO THE READING OF LEGOLAS CAN YOU BETTER IT
MAYBE I COULD SAID ARAGORN SMILING THERE ARE SOME OTHER SIGNS NEAR AT HAND THAT YOU HAVE NOT CONSIDERED I AGREE THAT THE PRISONER WAS A HOBBIT AND MUST HAVE HAD EITHER LEGS OR HANDS FREE BEFORE HE CAME HERE I GUESS THAT IT WAS HANDS BECAUSE THE RIDDLE THEN BECOMES EASIER AND ALSO BECAUSE AS I READ THE MARKS HE WAS CARRIED TO THIS POINT BY AN ORC BLOOD WAS SPILLED THERE A FEW PACES AWAY ORCBLOOD THERE ARE DEEP PRINTS OF HOOFS ALL ABOUT THIS SPOT AND SIGNS THAT A HEAVY THING WAS DRAGGED AWAY THE ORC WAS SLAIN BY HORSEMEN AND LATER HIS BODY WAS HAULED TO THE FIRE BUT THE HOBBIT WAS NOT SEEN HE WAS NOT IN THE OPEN FOR IT WAS NIGHT AND HE STILL HAD HIS ELVENCLOAK HE WAS EXHAUSTED AND HUNGRY AND IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT WHEN HE HAD CUT HIS BONDS WITH THE KNIFE OF HIS FALLEN ENEMY HE RESTED AND ATE A LITTLE BEFORE HE CREPT AWAY BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO KNOW THAT HE HAD SOME LEMBAS IN HIS POCKET EVEN THOUGH HE RAN AWAY WITHOUT GEAR OR PACK THAT PERHAPS IS LIKE A HOBBIT I SAY HE THOUGH I HOPE AND GUESS THAT BOTH MERRY AND PIPPIN WERE HERE TOGETHER THERE IS HOWEVER NOTHING TO SHOW THAT FOR CERTAIN
AND HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT EITHER OF OUR FRIENDS CAME TO HAVE A HAND FREE ASKED GIMLI
I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED ANSWERED ARAGORN NOR DO I KNOW WHY AN ORC WAS CARRYING THEM AWAY NOT TO HELP THEM TO ESCAPE WE MAY BE SURE NAY RATHER I THINK THAT I NOW BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND A MATTER THAT HAS PUZZLED ME FROM THE BEGINNING WHY WHEN BOROMIR HAD FALLEN WERE THE ORCS CONTENT WITH THE CAPTURE OF MERRY AND PIPPIN THEY DID NOT SEEK OUT THE REST OF US NOR ATTACK OUR CAMP BUT INSTEAD THEY WENT WITH ALL SPEED TOWARDS ISENGARD DID THEY SUPPOSE THEY HAD CAPTURED THE RINGBEARER AND HIS FAITHFUL COMRADE I THINK NOT THEIR MASTERS WOULD NOT DARE TO GIVE SUCH PLAIN ORDERS TO ORCS EVEN IF THEY KNEW SO MUCH THEMSELVES THEY WOULD NOT SPEAK OPENLY TO THEM OF THE RING THEY ARE NOT TRUSTY SERVANTS BUT I THINK THE ORCS HAD BEEN COMMANDED TO CAPTURE HOBBITS ALIVE AT ALL COSTS AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO SLIP OUT WITH THE PRECIOUS PRISONERS BEFORE THE BATTLE TREACHERY PERHAPS LIKELY ENOUGH WITH SUCH FOLK SOME LARGE AND BOLD ORC MAY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ESCAPE WITH THE PRIZE ALONE FOR HIS OWN ENDS THERE THAT IS MY TALE OTHERS MIGHT BE DEVISED BUT ON THIS WE MAY COUNT IN ANY CASE ONE AT LEAST OF OUR FRIENDS ESCAPED IT IS OUR TASK TO FIND HIM AND HELP HIM BEFORE WE RETURN TO ROHAN WE MUST NOT BE DAUNTED BY FANGORN SINCE NEED DROVE HIM INTO THAT DARK PLACE
I DO NOT KNOW WHICH DAUNTS ME MORE FANGORN OR THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG ROAD THROUGH ROHAN ON FOOT SAID GIMLI
THEN LET US GO TO THE FOREST SAID ARAGORN
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ARAGORN FOUND FRESH SIGNS AT ONE POINT NEAR THE BANK OF THE ENTWASH HE CAME UPON FOOTPRINTS HOBBITPRINTS BUT TOO LIGHT FOR MUCH TO BE MADE OF THEM THEN AGAIN BENEATH THE BOLE OF A GREAT TREE ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE WOOD MORE PRINTS WERE DISCOVERED THE EARTH WAS BARE AND DRY AND DID NOT REVEAL MUCH
ONE HOBBIT AT LEAST STOOD HERE FOR A WHILE AND LOOKED BACK AND THEN HE TURNED AWAY INTO THE FOREST SAID ARAGORN
THEN WE MUST GO IN TOO SAID GIMLI BUT I DO NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS FANGORN AND WE WERE WARNED AGAINST IT I WISH THE CHASE HAD LED ANYWHERE ELSE
I DO NOT THINK THE WOOD FEELS EVIL WHATEVER TALES MAY SAY SAID LEGOLAS HE STOOD UNDER THE EAVES OF THE FOREST STOOPING FORWARD AS IF HE WERE LISTENING AND PEERING WITH WIDE EYES INTO THE SHADOWS NO IT IS NOT EVIL OR WHAT EVIL IS IN IT IS FAR AWAY I CATCH ONLY THE FAINTEST ECHOES OF DARK PLACES WHERE THE HEARTS OF THE TREES ARE BLACK THERE IS NO MALICE NEAR US BUT THERE IS WATCHFULNESS AND ANGER
WELL IT HAS NO CAUSE TO BE ANGRY WITH ME SAID GIMLI I HAVE DONE IT NO HARM 
THAT IS JUST AS WELL SAID LEGOLAS BUT NONETHELESS IT HAS SUFFERED HARM THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING INSIDE OR GOING TO HAPPEN DO YOU NOT FEEL THE TENSENESS IT TAKES MY BREATH
I FEEL THE AIR IS STUFFY SAID THE DWARF THIS WOOD IS LIGHTER THAN MIRKWOOD BUT IT IS MUSTY AND SHABBY
IT IS OLD VERY OLD SAID THE ELF SO OLD THAT ALMOST I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN AS I HAVE NOT FELT SINCE I JOURNEYED WITH YOU CHILDREN IT IS OLD AND FULL OF MEMORY I COULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY HERE IF I HAD COME IN DAYS OF PEACE
I DARE SAY YOU COULD SNORTED GIMLI YOU ARE A WOODELF ANYWAY THOUGH ELVES OF ANY KIND ARE STRANGE FOLK YET YOU COMFORT ME WHERE YOU GO I WILL GO BUT KEEP YOUR BOW READY TO HAND AND I WILL KEEP MY AXE LOOSE IN MY BELT NOT FOR USE ON TREES HE ADDED HASTILY LOOKING UP AT THE TREE UNDER WHICH THEY STOOD I DO NOT WISH TO MEET THAT OLD MAN AT UNAWARES WITHOUT AN ARGUMENT READY TO HAND THAT IS ALL LET US GO
WITH THAT THE THREE HUNTERS PLUNGED INTO THE FOREST OF FANGORN LEGOLAS AND GIMLI LEFT THE TRACKING TO ARAGORN THERE WAS LITTLE FOR HIM TO SEE THE FLOOR OF THE FOREST WAS DRY AND COVERED WITH A DRIFT OF LEAVES BUT GUESSING THAT THE FUGITIVES WOULD STAY NEAR THE WATER HE RETURNED OFTEN TO THE BANKS OF THE STREAM SO IT WAS THAT HE CAME UPON THE PLACE WHERE MERRY AND PIPPIN HAD DRUNK AND BATHED THEIR FEET THERE PLAIN FOR ALL TO SEE WERE THE FOOTPRINTS OF TWO HOBBITS ONE SOMEWHAT SMALLER THAN THE OTHER
THIS IS GOOD TIDINGS SAID ARAGORN YET THE MARKS ARE TWO DAYS OLD AND IT SEEMS THAT AT THIS POINT THE HOBBITS LEFT THE WATERSIDE
THEN WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW SAID GIMLI WE CANNOT PURSUE THEM THROUGH THE WHOLE FASTNESS OF FANGORN WE HAVE COME ILL SUPPLIED IF WE DO NOT FIND THEM SOON WE SHALL BE OF NO USE TO THEM EXCEPT TO SIT DOWN BESIDE THEM AND SHOW OUR FRIENDSHIP BY STARVING TOGETHER
IF THAT IS INDEED ALL WE CAN DO THEN WE MUST DO THAT SAID ARAGORN LET US GO ON
THEY CAME AT LENGTH TO THE STEEP ABRUPT END OF TREEBEARDS HILL AND LOOKED UP AT THE ROCKWALL WITH ITS ROUGH STEPS LEADING TO THE HIGH SHELF GLEAMS OF SUN WERE STRIKING THROUGH THE HURRYING CLOUDS AND THE FOREST NOW LOOKED LESS GREY AND DREAR
LET US GO UP AND LOOK ABOUT US SAID LEGOLAS I WILL FEEL MY BREATH SHORT I SHOULD LIKE TO TASTE A FREER AIR FOR A WHILE
THE COMPANIONS CLIMBED UP ARAGORN CAME LAST MOVING SLOWLY HE WAS SCANNING THE STEPS AND LEDGES CLOSELY
I AM ALMOST SURE THAT THE HOBBITS HAVE BEEN UP HERE HE SAID BUT THERE ARE OTHER MARKS VERY STRANGE MARKS WHICH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND I WONDER IF WE CAN SEE ANYTHING FROM THIS LEDGE WHICH WILL HELP US TO GUESS WHICH WAY THEY WENT NEXT
HE STOOD UP AND LOOKED ABOUT BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT WAS OF ANY USE THE SHELF FACED SOUTHWARD AND EASTWARD BUT ONLY ON THE EAST WAS THE VIEW OPEN THERE HE COULD SEE THE HEADS OF THE TREES DESCENDING IN RANKS TOWARDS THE PLAIN FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME
WE HAVE JOURNEYED A LONG WAY ROUND SAID LEGOLAS WE COULD HAVE ALL COME HERE SAFE TOGETHER IF WE HAD LEFT THE GREAT RIVER ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY AND STRUCK WEST FEW CAN FORESEE WHITHER THEIR ROAD WILL LEAD THEM TILL THEY COME TO ITS END
BUT WE DID NOT WISH TO COME TO FANGORN SAID GIMLI
YET HERE WE ARE  AND NICELY CAUGHT IN THE NET SAID LEGOLAS LOOK
LOOK AT WHAT SAID GIMLI
THERE IN THE TREES
WHERE I HAVE NOT ELFEYES
HUSH SPEAK MORE SOFTLY LOOK SAID LEGOLAS POINTING DOWN IN THE WOOD BACK IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE JUST COME IT IS HE CANNOT YOU SEE HIM PASSING FROM TREE TO TREE
I SEE I SEE NOW HISSED GIMLI LOOK ARAGORN DID I NOT WARN YOU THERE IS THE OLD MAN ALL IN DIRTY GREY RAGS THAT IS WHY I COULD NOT SEE HIM AT FIRST
ARAGORN LOOKED AND BEHELD A BENT FIGURE MOVING SLOWLY IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY IT LOOKED LIKE AN OLD BEGGARMAN WALKING WEARILY LEANING ON A ROUGH STAFF HIS HEAD WAS BOWED AND HE DID NOT LOOK TOWARDS THEM IN OTHER LANDS THEY WOULD HAVE GREETED HIM WITH KIND WORDS BUT NOW THEY STOOD SILENT EACH FEELING A STRANGE EXPECTANCY SOMETHING WAS APPROACHING THAT HELD A HIDDEN POWER  OR MENACE
GIMLI GAZED WITH WIDE EYES FOR A WHILE AS STEP BY STEP THE FIGURE DREW NEARER THEN SUDDENLY UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIMSELF LONGER HE BURST OUT YOUR BOW LEGOLAS BEND IT GET READY IT IS SARUMAN DO NOT LET HIM SPEAK OR PUT A SPELL UPON US SHOOT FIRST
LEGOLAS TOOK HIS BOW AND BENT IT SLOWLY AND AS IF SOME OTHER WILL RESISTED HIM HE HELD AN ARROW LOOSELY IN HIS HAND BUT DID NOT FIT IT TO THE STRING ARAGORN STOOD SILENT HIS FACE WAS WATCHFUL AND INTENT
WHY ARE YOU WAITING WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU SAID GIMLI IN A HISSING WHISPER
LEGOLAS IS RIGHT SAID ARAGORN QUIETLY WE MAY NOT SHOOT AN OLD MAN SO AT UNAWARES AND UNCHALLENGED WHATEVER FEAR OR DOUBT BE ON US WATCH AND WAIT
AT THAT MOMENT THE OLD MAN QUICKENED HIS PACE AND CAME WITH SURPRISING SPEED TO THE FOOT OF THE ROCKWALL THEN SUDDENLY HE LOOKED UP WHILE THEY STOOD MOTIONLESS LOOKING DOWN THERE WAS NO SOUND
THEY COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE HE WAS HOODED AND ABOVE THE HOOD HE WORE A WIDEBRIMMED HAT SO THAT ALL HIS FEATURES WERE OVERSHADOWED EXCEPT FOR THE END OF HIS NOSE AND HIS GREY BEARD YET IT SEEMED TO ARAGORN THAT HE CAUGHT THE GLEAM OF EYES KEEN AND BRIGHT FROM WITHIN THE SHADOW OF THE HOODED BROWS
AT LAST THE OLD MAN BROKE THE SILENCE WELL MET INDEED MY FRIENDS HE SAID IN A SOFT VOICE I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU WILL YOU COME DOWN OR SHALL I COME UP WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER HE BEGAN TO CLIMB
NOW SAID GIMLI STOP HIM LEGOLAS
DID I NOT SAY THAT I WISHED TO SPEAK TO YOU SAID THE OLD MAN PUT AWAY THAT BOW MASTER ELF
THE BOW AND ARROW FELL FROM LEGOLAS HANDS AND HIS ARMS HUNG LOOSE AT HIS SIDES
AND YOU MASTER DWARF PRAY TAKE YOUR HAND FROM YOUR AXEHAFT TILL I AM UP YOU WILL NOT NEED SUCH ARGUMENTS
GIMLI STARTED AND THEN STOOD STILL AS STONE STARING WHILE THE OLD MAN SPRANG UP THE ROUGH STEPS AS NIMBLY AS A GOAT ALL WEARINESS SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT HIM AS HE STEPPED UP ON TO THE SHELF THERE WAS A GLEAM TOO BRIEF FOR CERTAINTY A QUICK GLINT OF WHITE AS IF SOME GARMENT SHROUDED BY THE GREY RAGS HAD BEEN FOR AN INSTANT REVEALED THE INTAKE OF GIMLIS BREATH COULD BE HEARD AS A LOUD HISS IN THE SILENCE
WELL MET I SAY AGAIN SAID THE OLD MAN COMING TOWARDS THEM WHEN HE WAS A FEW FEET AWAY HE STOOD STOOPING OVER HIS STAFF WITH HIS HEAD THRUST FORWARD PEERING AT THEM FROM UNDER HIS HOOD AND WHAT MAY YOU BE DOING IN THESE PARTS AN ELF A MAN AND A DWARF ALL CLAD IN ELVISH FASHION NO DOUBT THERE IS A TALE WORTH HEARING BEHIND IT ALL SUCH THINGS ARE NOT OFTEN SEEN HERE
YOU SPEAK AS ONE THAT KNOWS FANGORN WELL SAID ARAGORN IS THAT SO
NOT WELL SAID THE OLD MAN THAT WOULD BE THE STUDY OF MANY LIVES BUT I COME HERE NOW AND AGAIN
MIGHT WE KNOW YOUR NAME AND THEN HEAR WHAT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY TO US SAID ARAGORN THE MORNING PASSES AND WE HAVE AN ERRAND THAT WILL NOT WAIT
AS FOR WHAT I WISHED TO SAY I HAVE SAID IT WHAT MAY YOU BE DOING AND WHAT TALE CAN YOU TELL OF YOURSELVES AS FOR MY NAME HE BROKE OFF LAUGHING LONG AND SOFTLY ARAGORN FELT A SHUDDER RUN THROUGH HIM AT THE SOUND A STRANGE COLD THRILL AND YET IT WAS NOT FEAR OR TERROR THAT HE FELT RATHER IT WAS LIKE THE SUDDEN BITE OF A KEEN AIR OR THE SLAP OF A COLD RAIN THAT WAKES AN UNEASY SLEEPER
MY NAME SAID THE OLD MAN AGAIN HAVE YOU NOT GUESSED IT ALREADY YOU HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE I THINK YES YOU HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE BUT COME NOW WHAT OF YOUR TALE
THE THREE COMPANIONS STOOD SILENT AND MADE NO ANSWER
THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD BEGIN TO DOUBT WHETHER YOUR ERRAND IS FIT TO TELL SAID THE OLD MAN HAPPILY I KNOW SOMETHING OF IT YOU ARE TRACKING THE FOOTSTEPS OF TWO YOUNG HOBBITS I BELIEVE YES HOBBITS DONT STARE AS IF YOU HAD NEVER HEARD THE STRANGE NAME BEFORE YOU HAVE AND SO HAVE I WELL THEY CLIMBED UP HERE THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY AND THEY MET SOMEONE THAT THEY DID NOT EXPECT DOES THAT COMFORT YOU AND NOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN WELL WELL MAYBE I CAN GIVE YOU SOME NEWS ABOUT THAT BUT WHY ARE WE STANDING YOUR ERRAND YOU SEE IS NO LONGER AS URGENT AS YOU THOUGHT LET US SIT DOWN AND BE MORE AT EASE
THE OLD MAN TURNED AWAY AND WENT TOWARDS A HEAP OF FALLEN STONES AND ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF BEHIND IMMEDIATELY AS IF A SPELL HAD BEEN REMOVED THE OTHERS RELAXED AND STIRRED GIMLIS HAND WENT AT ONCE TO HIS AXEHAFT ARAGORN DREW HIS SWORD LEGOLAS PICKED UP HIS BOW
THE OLD MAN TOOK NO NOTICE BUT STOOPED AND SAT HIMSELF ON A LOW FLAT STONE THEN HIS GREY CLOAK DREW APART AND THEY SAW BEYOND DOUBT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED BENEATH ALL IN WHITE
SARUMAN CRIED GIMLI SPRINGING TOWARDS HIM WITH AXE IN HAND SPEAK TELL US WHERE YOU HAVE HIDDEN OUR FRIENDS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THEM SPEAK OR I WILL MAKE A DINT IN YOUR HAT THAT EVEN A WIZARD WILL FIND IT HARD TO DEAL WITH
THE OLD MAN WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND LEAPED TO THE TOP OF A LARGE ROCK THERE HE STOOD GROWN SUDDENLY TALL TOWERING ABOVE THEM HIS HOOD AND HIS GREY RAGS WERE FLUNG AWAY HIS WHITE GARMENTS SHONE HE LIFTED UP HIS STAFF AND GIMLIS AXE LEAPED FROM HIS GRASP AND FELL RINGING ON THE GROUND THE SWORD OF ARAGORN STIFF IN HIS MOTIONLESS HAND BLAZED WITH A SUDDEN FIRE LEGOLAS GAVE A GREAT SHOUT AND SHOT AN ARROW HIGH INTO THE AIR IT VANISHED IN A FLASH OF FLAME
MITHRANDIR HE CRIED MITHRANDIR
WELL MET I SAY TO YOU AGAIN LEGOLAS SAID THE OLD MAN
THEY ALL GAZED AT HIM HIS HAIR WAS WHITE AS SNOW IN THE SUNSHINE AND GLEAMING WHITE WAS HIS ROBE THE EYES UNDER HIS DEEP BROWS WERE BRIGHT PIERCING AS THE RAYS OF THE SUN POWER WAS IN HIS HAND BETWEEN WONDER JOY AND FEAR THEY STOOD AND FOUND NO WORDS TO SAY
AT LAST ARAGORN STIRRED GANDALF HE SAID BEYOND ALL HOPE YOU RETURN TO US IN OUR NEED WHAT VEIL WAS OVER MY SIGHT GANDALF GIMLI SAID NOTHING BUT SANK TO HIS KNEES SHADING HIS EYES
GANDALF THE OLD MAN REPEATED AS IF RECALLING FROM OLD MEMORY A LONG DISUSED WORD YES THAT WAS THE NAME I WAS GANDALF
HE STEPPED DOWN FROM THE ROCK AND PICKING UP HIS GREY CLOAK WRAPPED IT ABOUT HIM IT SEEMED AS IF THE SUN HAD BEEN SHINING BUT NOW WAS HID IN CLOUD AGAIN YES YOU MAY STILL CALL ME GANDALF HE SAID AND THE VOICE WAS THE VOICE OF THEIR OLD FRIEND AND GUIDE GET UP MY GOOD GIMLI NO BLAME TO YOU AND NO HARM DONE TO ME INDEED MY FRIENDS NONE OF YOU HAVE ANY WEAPON THAT COULD HURT ME BE MERRY WE MEET AGAIN AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE THE GREAT STORM IS COMING BUT THE TIDE HAS TURNED
HE LAID HIS HAND ON GIMLIS HEAD AND THE DWARF LOOKED UP AND LAUGHED SUDDENLY GANDALF HE SAID BUT YOU ARE ALL IN WHITE
YES I AM WHITE NOW SAID GANDALF INDEED I AM SARUMAN ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY SARUMAN AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT COME NOW TELL ME OF YOURSELVES I HAVE PASSED THROUGH FIRE AND DEEP WATER SINCE WE PARTED I HAVE FORGOTTEN MUCH THAT I THOUGHT I KNEW AND LEARNED AGAIN MUCH THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN I CAN SEE MANY THINGS FAR OFF BUT MANY THINGS THAT ARE CLOSE AT HAND I CANNOT SEE TELL ME OF YOURSELVES
WHAT DO YOU WISH TO KNOW SAID ARAGORN ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE WE PARTED ON THE BRIDGE WOULD BE A LONG TALE WILL YOU NOT FIRST GIVE US NEWS OF THE HOBBITS DID YOU FIND THEM AND ARE THEY SAFE
NO I DID NOT FIND THEM SAID GANDALF THERE WAS A DARKNESS OVER THE VALLEYS OF THE EMYN MUIL AND I DID NOT KNOW OF THEIR CAPTIVITY UNTIL THE EAGLE TOLD ME
THE EAGLE SAID LEGOLAS I HAVE SEEN AN EAGLE HIGH AND FAR OFF THE LAST TIME WAS THREE DAYS AGO ABOVE THE EMYN MUIL
YES SAID GANDALF THAT WAS GWAIHIR THE WINDLORD WHO RESCUED ME FROM ORTHANC I SENT HIM BEFORE ME TO WATCH THE RIVER AND GATHER TIDINGS HIS SIGHT IS KEEN BUT HE CANNOT SEE ALL THAT PASSES UNDER HILL AND TREE SOME THINGS HE HAS SEEN AND OTHERS I HAVE SEEN MYSELF THE RING NOW HAS PASSED BEYOND MY HELP OR THE HELP OF ANY OF THE COMPANY THAT SET OUT FROM RIVENDELL VERY NEARLY IT WAS REVEALED TO THE ENEMY BUT IT ESCAPED I HAD SOME PART IN THAT FOR I SAT IN A HIGH PLACE AND I STROVE WITH THE DARK TOWER AND THE SHADOW PASSED THEN I WAS WEARY VERY WEARY AND I WALKED LONG IN DARK THOUGHT
THEN YOU KNOW ABOUT FRODO SAID GIMLI HOW DO THINGS GO WITH HIM
I CANNOT SAY HE WAS SAVED FROM A GREAT PERIL BUT MANY LIE BEFORE HIM STILL HE RESOLVED TO GO ALONE TO MORDOR AND HE SET OUT THAT IS ALL THAT I CAN SAY
NOT ALONE SAID LEGOLAS WE THINK THAT SAM WENT WITH HIM
DID HE SAID GANDALF AND THERE WAS A GLEAM IN HIS EYE AND A SMILE ON HIS FACE DID HE INDEED IT IS NEWS TO ME YET IT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME GOOD VERY GOOD YOU LIGHTEN MY HEART YOU MUST TELL ME MORE NOW SIT BY ME AND TELL ME THE TALE OF YOUR JOURNEY
THE COMPANIONS SAT ON THE GROUND AT HIS FEET AND ARAGORN TOOK UP THE TALE FOR A LONG WHILE GANDALF SAID NOTHING AND HE ASKED NO QUESTIONS HIS HANDS WERE SPREAD UPON HIS KNEES AND HIS EYES WERE CLOSED AT LAST WHEN ARAGORN SPOKE OF THE DEATH OF BOROMIR AND OF HIS LAST JOURNEY UPON THE GREAT RIVER THE OLD MAN SIGHED
YOU HAVE NOT SAID ALL THAT YOU KNOW OR GUESS ARAGORN MY FRIEND HE SAID QUIETLY POOR BOROMIR I COULD NOT SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IT WAS A SORE TRIAL FOR SUCH A MAN A WARRIOR AND A LORD OF MEN GALADRIEL TOLD ME THAT HE WAS IN PERIL BUT HE ESCAPED IN THE END I AM GLAD IT WAS NOT IN VAIN THAT THE YOUNG HOBBITS CAME WITH US IF ONLY FOR BOROMIRS SAKE BUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY PART THEY HAVE TO PLAY THEY WERE BROUGHT TO FANGORN AND THEIR COMING WAS LIKE THE FALLING OF SMALL STONES THAT STARTS AN AVALANCHE IN THE MOUNTAINS EVEN AS WE TALK HERE I HEAR THE FIRST RUMBLINGS SARUMAN HAD BEST NOT BE CAUGHT AWAY FROM HOME WHEN THE DAM BURSTS
IN ONE THING YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED DEAR FRIEND SAID ARAGORN YOU STILL SPEAK IN RIDDLES

I AM NO LONGER YOUNG EVEN IN THE RECKONING OF MEN OF THE ANCIENT HOUSES SAID ARAGORN WILL YOU NOT OPEN YOUR MIND MORE CLEARLY TO ME
WHAT THEN SHALL I SAY SAID GANDALF AND PAUSED FOR A WHILE IN THOUGHT THIS IN BRIEF IS HOW I SEE THINGS AT THE MOMENT IF YOU WISH TO HAVE A PIECE OF MY MIND AS PLAIN AS POSSIBLE THE ENEMY OF COURSE HAS LONG KNOWN THAT THE RING IS ABROAD AND THAT IT IS BORNE BY A HOBBIT HE KNOWS NOW THE NUMBER OF OUR COMPANY THAT SET OUT FROM RIVENDELL AND THE KIND OF EACH OF US BUT HE DOES NOT YET PERCEIVE OUR PURPOSE CLEARLY HE SUPPOSES THAT WE WERE ALL GOING TO MINAS TIRITH FOR THAT IS WHAT HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE DONE IN OUR PLACE AND ACCORDING TO HIS WISDOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HEAVY STROKE AGAINST HIS POWER INDEED HE IS IN GREAT FEAR NOT KNOWING WHAT MIGHTY ONE MAY SUDDENLY APPEAR WIELDING THE RING AND ASSAILING HIM WITH WAR SEEKING TO CAST HIM DOWN AND TAKE HIS PLACE THAT WE SHOULD WISH TO CAST HIM DOWN AND HAVE NO ONE IN HIS PLACE IS NOT A THOUGHT THAT OCCURS TO HIS MIND THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO DESTROY THE RING ITSELF HAS NOT YET ENTERED INTO HIS DARKEST DREAM IN WHICH NO DOUBT YOU WILL SEE OUR GOOD FORTUNE AND OUR HOPE FOR IMAGINING WAR HE HAS LET LOOSE WAR BELIEVING THAT HE HAS NO TIME TO WASTE FOR HE THAT STRIKES THE FIRST BLOW IF HE STRIKES IT HARD ENOUGH MAY NEED TO STRIKE NO MORE SO THE FORCES THAT HE HAS LONG BEEN PREPARING HE IS NOW SETTING IN MOTION SOONER THAN HE INTENDED WISE FOOL FOR IF HE HAD USED ALL HIS POWER TO GUARD MORDOR SO THAT NONE COULD ENTER AND BENT ALL HIS GUILD TO THE HUNTING OF THE RING THEN INDEED HOPE WOULD HAVE FADED NEITHER RING NOR BEARER COULD LONG HAVE ELUDED HIM BUT NOW HIS EYE GAZES ABROAD RATHER THAN NEAR AT HOME AND MOSTLY HE LOOKS TOWARDS MINAS TIRITH VERY SOON NOW HIS STRENGTH WILL FALL UPON IT LIKE A STORM
FOR ALREADY HE KNOWS THAT THE MESSENGERS THAT HE SENT TO WAYLAY THE COMPANY HAVE FAILED AGAIN THEY HAVE NOT FOUND THE RING NEITHER HAVE THEY BROUGHT AWAY ANY HOBBITS AS HOSTAGES HAD THEY DONE EVEN SO MUCH AS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HEAVY BLOW TO US AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL BUT LET US NOT DARKEN OUR HEARTS BY IMAGINING THE TRIAL OF THEIR GENTLE LOYALTY IN THE DARK TOWER FOR THE ENEMY HAS FAILED  SO FAR THANKS TO SARUMAN
THEN IS NOT SARUMAN A TRAITOR SAID GIMLI
INDEED YES SAID GANDALF DOUBLY AND IS NOT THAT STRANGE NOTHING THAT WE HAVE ENDURED OF LATE HAS SEEMED SO GRIEVOUS AS THE TREASON OF ISENGARD EVEN RECKONED AS A LORD AND CAPTAIN SARUMAN HAS GROWN VERY STRONG HE THREATENS THE MEN OF ROHAN AND DRAWS OFF THEIR HELP FROM MINAS TIRITH EVEN AS THE MAIN BLOW IS APPROACHING FROM THE EAST YET A TREACHEROUS WEAPON IS EVER A DANGER TO THE HAND SARUMAN ALSO HAD A MIND TO CAPTURE THE RING FOR HIMSELF OR AT LEAST TO SNARE SOME HOBBITS FOR HIS EVIL PURPOSES SO BETWEEN THEM OUR ENEMIES HAVE CONTRIVED ONLY TO BRING MERRY AND PIPPIN WITH MARVELLOUS SPEED AND IN THE NICK OF TIME TO FANGORN WHERE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE COME AT ALL
ALSO THEY HAVE FILLED THEMSELVES WITH NEW DOUBTS THAT DISTURB THEIR PLANS NO TIDINGS OF THE BATTLE WILL COME TO MORDOR THANKS TO THE HORSEMEN OF ROHAN BUT THE DARK LORD KNOWS THAT TWO HOBBITS WERE TAKEN IN THE EMYN MUIL AND BORNE AWAY TOWARDS ISENGARD AGAINST THE WILL OF HIS OWN SERVANTS HE NOW HAS ISENGARD TO FEAR AS WELL AS MINAS TIRITH IF MINAS TIRITH FALLS IT WILL GO ILL WITH SARUMAN
IT IS A PITY THAT OUR FRIENDS LIE IN BETWEEN SAID GIMLI IF NO LAND DIVIDED ISENGARD AND MORDOR THEN THEY COULD FIGHT WHILE WE WATCHED AND WAITED
THE VICTOR WOULD EMERGE STRONGER THAN EITHER AND FREE FROM DOUBT SAID GANDALF BUT ISENGARD CANNOT FIGHT MORDOR UNLESS SARUMAN FIRST OBTAINS THE RING THAT HE WILL NEVER DO NOW HE DOES NOT YET KNOW HIS PERIL THERE IS MUCH THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW HE WAS SO EAGER TO LAY HIS HANDS ON HIS PREY THAT HE COULD NOT WAIT AT HOME AND HE CAME FORTH TO MEET AND TO SPY ON HIS MESSENGERS BUT HE CAME TOO LATE FOR ONCE AND THE BATTLE WAS OVER AND BEYOND HIS HELP BEFORE HE REACHED THESE PARTS HE DID NOT REMAIN HERE LONG I LOOK INTO HIS MIND AND I SEE HIS DOUBT HE HAS NO WOODCRAFT HE BELIEVES THAT THE HORSEMEN SLEW AND BURNED ALL UPON THE FIELD OF BATTLE BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER THE ORCS WERE BRINGING ANY PRISONERS OR NOT AND HE DOES NOT KNOW OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN HIS SERVANTS AND THE ORCS OF MORDOR NOR DOES HE KNOW OF THE WINGED MESSENGER
THE WINGED MESSENGER CRIED LEGOLAS I SHOT AT HIM WITH THE BOW OF GALADRIEL ABOVE SARN GEBIR AND I FELLED HIM FROM THE SKY HE FILLED US ALL WITH FEAR WHAT NEW TERROR IS THIS
ONE THAT YOU CANNOT SLAY WITH ARROWS SAID GANDALF YOU ONLY SLEW HIS STEED IT WAS A GOOD DEED BUT THE RIDER WAS SOON HORSED AGAIN FOR HE WAS A NAZGUL ONE OF THE NINE WHO RIDE NOW UPON WINGED STEEDS SOON THEIR TERROR WILL OVERSHADOW THE LAST ARMIES OF OUR FRIENDS CUTTING OFF THE SUN BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN ALLOWED TO CROSS THE RIVER AND SARUMAN DOES NOT KNOW OF THIS NEW SHAPE IN WHICH THE RINGWRAITHS HAVE BEEN CLAD HIS THOUGHT IS EVER ON THE RING WAS IT PRESENT IN THE BATTLE WAS IT FOUND WHAT IF THEODEN LORD OF THE MARK SHOULD COME BY IT AND LEARN OF ITS POWER THAT IS THE DANGER THAT HE SEES AND HE HAS FLED BACK TO ISENGARD TO DOUBLE AND TREBLE HIS ASSAULT ON ROHAN AND ALL THE TIME THERE IS ANOTHER DANGER CLOSE AT HAND WHICH HE DOES NOT SEE BUSY WITH HIS FIERY THOUGHTS HE HAS FORGOTTEN TREEBEARD
NOW YOU SPEAK TO YOURSELF AGAIN SAID ARAGORN WITH A SMILE TREEBEARD IS NOT KNOWN TO ME AND I HAVE GUESSED PART OF SARUMANS DOUBLE TREACHERY YET I DO NOT SEE IN WHAT WAY THE COMING OF TWO HOBBITS TO FANGORN HAS SERVED SAVE TO GIVE US A LONG AND FRUITLESS CHASE
WAIT A MINUTE CRIED GIMLI THERE IS ANOTHER THING THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW FIRST WAS IT YOU GANDALF OR SARUMAN THAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT
YOU CERTAINLY DID NOT SEE ME ANSWERED GANDALF THEREFORE I MUST GUESS THAT YOU SAW SARUMAN EVIDENTLY WE LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE THAT YOUR DESIRE TO MAKE AN INCURABLE DENT IN MY HAT MUST BE EXCUSED
GOOD GOOD SAID GIMLI I AM GLAD THAT IT WAS NOT YOU
GANDALF LAUGHED AGAIN YES MY GOOD DWARF HE SAID IT IS A COMFORT NOT TO BE MISTAKEN AT ALL POINTS DO I NOT KNOW IT ONLY TOO WELL BUT OF COURSE I NEVER BLAMED YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME OF ME HOW COULD I DO SO WHO HAVE SO OFTEN COUNSELLED MY FRIENDS TO SUSPECT EVEN THEIR OWN HANDS WHEN DEALING WITH THE ENEMY BLESS YOU GIMLI SON OF GLOIN MAYBE YOU WILL SEE US BOTH TOGETHER ONE DAY AND JUDGE BETWEEN US
BUT THE HOBBITS LEGOLAS BROKE IN WE HAVE COME FAR TO SEEK THEM AND YOU SEEM TO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WHERE ARE THEY NOW
WITH TREEBEARD AND THE ENTS SAID GANDALF
THE ENTS EXCLAIMED ARAGORN THEN THERE IS TRUTH IN THE OLD LEGENDS ABOUT THE DWELLERS IN THE DEEP FORESTS AND THE GIANT SHEPHERDS OF THE TREES ARE THERE STILL ENTS IN THE WORLD I THOUGHT THEY WERE ONLY A MEMORY OF ANCIENT DAYS IF INDEED THEY WERE EVER MORE THAN A LEGEND OF ROHAN
A LEGEND OF ROHAN CRIED LEGOLAS NAY EVERY ELF IN WILDERLAND HAS SUNG SONGS OF THE OLD ONODRIM AND THEIR LONG SORROW YET EVEN AMONG US THEY ARE ONLY A MEMORY IF I WERE TO MEET ONE STILL WALKING IN THIS WORLD THEN INDEED I SHOULD FEEL YOUNG AGAIN BUT TREEBEARD THAT IS ONLY A RENDERING OF FANGORN INTO THE COMMON SPEECH YET YOU SEEM TO SPEAK OF A PERSON WHO IS THIS TREEBEARD
AH NOW YOU ARE ASKING MUCH SAID GANDALF THE LITTLE THAT I KNOW OF HIS LONG SLOW STORY WOULD MAKE A TALE FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO TIME NOW TREEBEARD IS FANGORN THE GUARDIAN OF THE FOREST HE IS THE OLDEST OF THE ENTS THE OLDEST LIVING THING THAT STILL WALKS BENEATH THE SUN UPON THIS MIDDLEEARTH I HOPE INDEED LEGOLAS THAT YOU MAY YET MEET HIM MERRY AND PIPPIN HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE THEY MET HIM HERE EVEN WHERE WE SIT FOR HE CAME HERE TWO DAYS AGO AND BORE THEM AWAY TO HIS DWELLING FAR OFF BY THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS HE OFTEN COMES HERE ESPECIALLY WHEN HIS MIND IS UNEASY AND RUMOURS OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE TROUBLE HIM I SAW HIM FOUR DAYS AGO STRIDING AMONG THE TREES AND I THINK HE SAW ME FOR HE PAUSED BUT I DID NOT SPEAK FOR I WAS HEAVY WITH THOUGHT AND WEARY AFTER MY STRUGGLE WITH THE EYE OF MORDOR AND HE DID NOT SPEAK EITHER NOR CALL MY NAME
PERHAPS HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE SARUMAN SAID GIMLI BUT YOU SPEAK OF HIM AS IF HE WAS A FRIEND I THOUGHT FANGORN WAS DANGEROUS
DANGEROUS CRIED GANDALF AND SO AM I VERY DANGEROUS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING YOU WILL EVER MEET UNLESS YOU ARE BROUGHT ALIVE BEFORE THE SEAT OF THE DARK LORD AND ARAGORN IS DANGEROUS AND LEGOLAS IS DANGEROUS YOU ARE BESET WITH DANGERS GIMLI SON OF GLOIN FOR YOU ARE DANGEROUS YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN FASHION CERTAINLY THE FOREST OF FANGORN IS PERILOUSNOT LEAST TO THOSE THAT ARE TOO READY WITH THEIR AXES AND FANGORN HIMSELF HE IS PERILOUS TOO YET HE IS WISE AND KINDLY NONETHELESS BUT NOW HIS LONG SLOW WRATH IS BRIMMING OVER AND ALL THE FOREST IS FILLED WITH IT THE COMING OF THE HOBBITS AND THE TIDINGS THAT THEY BROUGHT HAVE SPILLED IT IT WILL SOON BE RUNNING LIKE A FLOOD BUT ITS TIDE IS TURNED AGAINST SARUMAN AND THE AXES OF ISENGARD A THING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE ELDER DAYS THE ENTS ARE GOING TO WAKE UP AND FIND THAT THEY ARE STRONG
WHAT WILL THEY DO ASKED LEGOLAS IN ASTONISHMENT
I DO NOT KNOW SAID GANDALF I DO NOT THINK THEY KNOW THEMSELVES I WONDER HE FELL SILENT HIS HEAD BOWED IN THOUGHT
THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM A GLEAM OF SUN THROUGH FLEETING CLOUDS FELL ON HIS HANDS WHICH LAY NOW UPTURNED ON HIS LAP THEY SEEMED TO BE FILLED WITH LIGHT AS A CUP IS WITH WATER AT LAST HE LOOKED UP AND GAZED STRAIGHT AT THE SUN
THE MORNING IS WEARING AWAY HE SAID SOON WE MUST GO
DO WE GO TO FIND OUR FRIENDS AND TO SEE TREEBEARD ASKED ARAGORN
NO SAID GANDALF THAT IS NOT THE ROAD THAT YOU MUST TAKE I HAVE SPOKEN WORDS OF HOPE BUT ONLY OF HOPE HOPE IS NOT VICTORY WAR IS UPON US AND ALL OUR FRIENDS A WAR IN WHICH ONLY THE USE OF THE RING COULD GIVE US SURETY OF VICTORY IT FILLS ME WITH GREAT SORROW AND GREAT FEAR FOR MUCH SHALL BE DESTROYED AND ALL MAY BE LOST I AM GANDALF GANDALF THE WHITE BUT BLACK IS MIGHTIER STILL
HE ROSE AND GAZED OUT EASTWARD SHADING HIS EYES AS IF HE SAW THINGS FAR AWAY THAT NONE OF THEM COULD SEE THEN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE SAID IN A SOFT VOICE IT HAS GONE BEYOND OUR REACH OF THAT AT LEAST LET US BE GLAD WE CAN NO LONGER BE TEMPTED TO USE THE RING WE MUST GO DOWN TO FACE A PERIL NEAR DESPAIR YET THAT DEADLY PERIL IS REMOVED
HE TURNED COME ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN HE SAID DO NOT REGRET YOUR CHOICE IN THE VALLEY OF THE EMYN MUIL NOR CALL IT A VAIN PURSUIT YOU CHOSE AMID DOUBTS THE PATH THAT SEEMED RIGHT THE CHOICE WAS JUST AND IT HAS BEEN REWARDED FOR SO WE HAVE MET IN TIME WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE MET TOO LATE BUT THE QUEST OF YOUR COMPANIONS IS OVER YOUR NEXT JOURNEY IS MARKED BY YOUR GIVEN WORD YOU MUST GO TO EDORAS AND SEEK OUT THEODEN IN HIS HALL FOR YOU ARE NEEDED THE LIGHT OF ANDURIL MUST NOW BE UNCOVERED IN THE BATTLE FOR WHICH IT HAS SO LONG WAITED THERE IS WAR IN ROHAN AND WORSE EVIL IT GOES ILL WITH THEODEN
THEN ARE WE NOT TO SEE THE MERRY YOUNG HOBBITS AGAIN SAID LEGOLAS
I DID NOT SAY SO SAID GANDALF WHO KNOWS HAVE PATIENCE GO WHERE YOU MUST GO AND HOPE TO EDORAS I GO THITHER ALSO
IT IS A LONG WAY FOR A MAN TO WALK YOUNG OR OLD SAID ARAGORN I FEAR THE BATTLE WILL BE OVER LONG ERE I COME THERE
WE SHALL SEE WE SHALL SEE SAID GANDALF WILL YOU COME NOW WITH ME
YES WE WILL SET OUT TOGETHER SAID ARAGORN BUT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU WILL COME THERE BEFORE ME IF YOU WISH HE ROSE AND LOOKED LONG AT GANDALF THE OTHERS GAZED AT THEM IN SILENCE AS THEY STOOD THERE FACING ONE ANOTHER THE GREY FIGURE OF THE MAN ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN WAS TALL AND STERN AS STONE HIS HAND UPON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD HE LOOKED AS IF SOME KING OUT OF THE MISTS OF THE SEA HAD STEPPED UPON THE SHORES OF LESSER MEN BEFORE HIM STOOPED THE OLD FIGURE WHITE SHINING NOW AS IF WITH SOME LIGHT KINDLED WITHIN BENT LADEN WITH YEARS BUT HOLDING A POWER BEYOND THE STRENGTH OF KINGS
DO I NOT SAY TRULY GANDALF SAID ARAGORN AT LAST THAT YOU COULD GO WHITHERSOEVER YOU WISHED QUICKER THAN I AND THIS I ALSO SAY YOU ARE OUR CAPTAIN AND OUR BANNER THE DARK LORD HAS NINE BUT WE HAVE ONE MIGHTIER THAN THEY THE WHITE RIDER HE HAS PASSED THROUGH THE FIRE AND THE ABYSS AND THEY SHALL FEAR HIM WE WILL GO WHERE HE LEADS
YES TOGETHER WE WILL FOLLOW YOU SAID LEGOLAS BUT FIRST IT WOULD EASE MY HEART GANDALF TO HEAR WHAT BEFELL YOU IN MORIA WILL YOU NOT TELL US CAN YOU NOT STAY EVEN TO TELL YOUR FRIENDS HOW YOU WERE DELIVERED
I HAVE STAYED ALREADY TOO LONG ANSWERED GANDALF TIME IS SHORT BUT IF THERE WERE A YEAR TO SPEND I WOULD NOT TELL YOU ALL
THEN TELL US WHAT YOU WILL AND TIME ALLOWS SAID GIMLI COME GANDALF TELL US HOW YOU FARED WITH THE BALROG
NAME HIM NOT SAID GANDALF AND FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED THAT A CLOUD OF PAIN PASSED OVER HIS FACE AND HE SAT SILENT LOOKING OLD AS DEATH LONG TIME I FELL HE SAID AT LAST SLOWLY AS IF THINKING BACK WITH DIFFICULTY LONG I FELL AND HE FELL WITH ME HIS FIRE WAS ABOUT ME I WAS BURNED THEN WE PLUNGED INTO THE DEEP WATER AND ALL WAS DARK COLD IT WAS AS THE TIDE OF DEATH ALMOST IT FROZE MY HEART
DEEP IS THE ABYSS THAT IS SPANNED BY DURINS BRIDGE AND NONE HAS MEASURED IT SAID GIMLI
YET IT HAS A BOTTOM BEYOND LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE SAID GANDALF THITHER I CAME AT LAST TO THE UTTERMOST FOUNDATIONS OF STONE HE WAS WITH ME STILL HIS FIRE WAS QUENCHED BUT NOW HE WAS A THING OF SLIME STRONGER THAN A STRANGLING SNAKE
WE FOUGHT FAR UNDER THE LIVING EARTH WHERE TIME IS NOT COUNTED EVER HE CLUTCHED ME AND EVER I HEWED HIM TILL AT LAST HE FLED INTO DARK TUNNELS THEY WERE NOT MADE BY DURINS FOLK GIMLI SON OF GLOIN FAR FAR BELOW THE DEEPEST DELVING OF THE DWARVES THE WORLD IS GNAWED BY NAMELESS THINGS EVEN SAURON KNOWS THEM NOT THEY ARE OLDER THAN HE NOW I HAVE WALKED THERE BUT I WILL BRING NO REPORT TO DARKEN THE LIGHT OF DAY IN THAT DESPAIR MY ENEMY WAS MY ONLY HOPE AND I PURSUED HIM CLUTCHING AT HIS HEEL THUS HE BROUGHT ME BACK AT LAST TO THE SECRET WAYS OF KHAZADDUM TOO WELL HE KNEW THEM ALL EVER UP NOW WE WENT UNTIL WE CAME TO THE ENDLESS STAIR
LONG HAS THAT BEEN LOST SAID GIMLI MANY HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS NEVER MADE SAVE IN LEGEND BUT OTHERS SAY THAT IT WAS DESTROYED
IT WAS MADE AND IT HAD NOT BEEN DESTROYED SAID GANDALF FROM THE LOWEST DUNGEON TO THE HIGHEST PEAK IT CLIMBED ASCENDING IN UNBROKEN SPIRAL IN MANY THOUSAND STEPS UNTIL IT ISSUED AT LAST IN DURINS TOWER CARVED IN THE LIVING ROCK OF ZIRAKZIGIL THE PINNACLE OF THE SILVERTINE
THERE UPON CELEBDIL WAS A LONELY WINDOW IN THE SNOW AND BEFORE IT LAY A NARROW SPACE A DIZZY EYRIE ABOVE THE MISTS OF THE WORLD THE SUN SHONE FIERCELY THERE BUT ALL BELOW WAS WRAPPED IN CLOUD OUT HE SPRANG AND EVEN AS I CAME BEHIND HE BURST INTO NEW FLAME THERE WAS NONE TO SEE OR PERHAPS IN AFTER AGES SONGS WOULD STILL BE SUNG OF THE BATTLE OF THE PEAK SUDDENLY GANDALF LAUGHED BUT WHAT WOULD THEY SAY IN SONG THOSE THAT LOOKED UP FROM AFAR THOUGHT THAT THE MOUNTAIN WAS CROWNED WITH STORM THUNDER THEY HEARD AND LIGHTNING THEY SAID SMOTE UPON CELEBDIL AND LEAPED BACK BROKEN INTO TONGUES OF FIRE IS NOT THAT ENOUGH A GREAT SMOKE ROSE ABOUT US VAPOUR AND STEAM ICE FELL LIKE RAIN I THREW DOWN MY ENEMY AND HE FELL FROM THE HIGH PLACE AND BROKE THE MOUNTAINSIDE WHERE HE SMOTE IT IN HIS RUIN THEN DARKNESS TOOK ME AND I STRAYED OUT OF THOUGHT AND TIME AND I WANDERED FAR ON ROADS THAT I WILL NOT TELL
NAKED I WAS SENT BACK  FOR A BRIEF TIME UNTIL MY TASK IS DONE AND NAKED I LAY UPON THE MOUNTAINTOP THE TOWER BEHIND WAS CRUMBLED INTO DUST THE WINDOW GONE THE RUINED STAIR WAS CHOKED WITH BURNED AND BROKEN STONE I WAS ALONE FORGOTTEN WITHOUT ESCAPE UPON THE HARD HORN OF THE WORLD THERE I LAY STARING UPWARD WHILE THE STARS WHEELED OVER AND EACH DAY WAS AS LONG AS A LIFEAGE OF THE EARTH FAINT TO MY EARS CAME THE GATHERED RUMOUR OF ALL LANDS THE SPRINGING AND THE DYING THE SONG AND THE WEEPING AND THE SLOW EVERLASTING GROAN OF OVERBURDENED STONE AND SO AT THE LAST GWAIHIR THE WINDLORD FOUND ME AGAIN AND HE TOOK ME UP AND BORE ME AWAY

TO LEGOLAS SHE SENT THIS WORD
LEGOLAS GREENLEAF LONG UNDER TREE
IN JOY THOU HAST LIVED BEWARE OF THE SEA
IF THOU HEAREST THE CRY OF THE GULL ON THE SHORE
THY HEART SHALL THEN REST IN THE FOREST NO MORE

GANDALF FELL SILENT AND SHUT HIS EYES
THEN SHE SENT ME NO MESSAGE SAID GIMLI AND BENT HIS HEAD
DARK ARE HER WORDS SAID LEGOLAS AND LITTLE DO THEY MEAN TO THOSE THAT RECEIVE THEM
THAT IS NO COMFORT SAID GIMLI
WHAT THEN SAID LEGOLAS WOULD YOU HAVE HER SPEAK OPENLY TO YOU OF YOUR DEATH
YES IF SHE HAD NOUGHT ELSE TO SAY
WHAT IS THAT SAID GANDALF OPENING HIS EYES YES I THINK I CAN GUESS WHAT HER WORDS MAY MEAN YOUR PARDON GIMLI I WAS PONDERING THE MESSAGES ONCE AGAIN BUT INDEED SHE SENT WORDS TO YOU AND NEITHER DARK NOR SAD
TO GIMLI SON OF GLOIN SHE SAID GIVE HIS LADYS GREETING LOCKBEARER WHEREVER THOU GOEST MY THOUGHT GOES WITH THEE BUT HAVE A CARE TO LAY THINE AXE TO THE RIGHT TREE
IN HAPPY HOUR YOU HAVE RETURNED TO US GANDALF CRIED THE DWARF CAPERING AS HE SANG LOUDLY IN THE STRANGE DWARFTONGUE COME COME HE SHOUTED SWINGING HIS AXE SINCE GANDALFS HEAD IS NOW SACRED LET US FIND ONE THAT IT IS RIGHT TO CLEAVE
THAT WILL NOT BE FAR TO SEEK SAID GANDALF RISING FROM HIS SEAT COME WE HAVE SPENT ALL THE TIME THAT IS ALLOWED TO A MEETING OF PARTED FRIENDS NOW THERE IS NEED OF HASTE
HE WRAPPED HIMSELF AGAIN IN HIS OLD TATTERED CLOAK AND LED THE WAY FOLLOWING HIM THEY DESCENDED QUICKLY FROM THE HIGH SHELF AND MADE THEIR WAY BACK THROUGH THE FOREST DOWN THE BANK OF THE ENTWASH THEY SPOKE NO MORE WORDS UNTIL THEY STOOD AGAIN UPON THE GRASS BEYOND THE EAVES OF FANGORN THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEIR HORSES TO BE SEEN
THEY HAVE NOT RETURNED SAID LEGOLAS IT WILL BE A WEARY WALK
I SHALL NOT WALK TIME PRESSES SAID GANDALF THEN LIFTING UP HIS HEAD HE GAVE A LONG WHISTLE SO CLEAR AND PIERCING WAS THE NOTE THAT THE OTHERS STOOD AMAZED TO HEAR SUCH A SOUND COME FROM THOSE OLD BEARDED LIPS THREE TIMES HE WHISTLED AND THEN FAINT AND FAR OFF IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEY HEARD THE WHINNY OF A HORSE BORNE UP FROM THE PLAINS UPON THE EASTERN WIND THEY WAITED WONDERING BEFORE LONG THERE CAME THE SOUND OF HOOFS AT FIRST HARDLY MORE THAN A TREMOR OF THE GROUND PERCEPTIBLE ONLY TO ARAGORN AS HE LAY UPON THE GRASS THEN GROWING STEADILY LOUDER AND CLEARER TO A QUICK BEAT
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE HORSE COMING SAID ARAGORN
CERTAINLY SAID GANDALF WE ARE TOO GREAT A BURDEN FOR ONE
THERE ARE THREE SAID LEGOLAS GAZING OUT OVER THE PLAIN SEE HOW THEY RUN THERE IS HASUFEL AND THERE IS MY FRIEND AROD BESIDE HIM BUT THERE IS ANOTHER THAT STRIDES AHEAD A VERY GREAT HORSE I HAVE NOT SEEN HIS LIKE BEFORE

EVEN AS THE OLD WIZARD SPOKE THE GREAT HORSE CAME STRIDING UP THE SLOPE TOWARDS THEM HIS COAT WAS GLISTENING AND HIS MANE FLOWING IN THE WIND OF HIS SPEED THE TWO OTHERS FOLLOWED NOW FAR BEHIND AS SOON AS SHADOWFAX SAW GANDALF HE CHECKED HIS PACE AND WHINNIED LOUDLY THEN TROTTING GENTLY FORWARD HE STOOPED HIS PROUD HEAD AND NUZZLED HIS GREAT NOSTRILS AGAINST THE OLD MANS NECK
GANDALF CARESSED HIM IT IS A LONG WAY FROM RIVENDELL MY FRIEND HE SAID BUT YOU ARE WISE AND SWIFT AND COME AT NEED FAR LET US RIDE NOW TOGETHER AND PART NOT IN THIS WORLD AGAIN

YES I KNEW SAID THE WIZARD I BENT MY THOUGHT UPON HIM BIDDING HIM TO MAKE HASTE FOR YESTERDAY HE WAS FAR AWAY IN THE SOUTH OF THIS LAND SWIFTLY MAY HE BEAR ME BACK AGAIN
GANDALF SPOKE NOW TO SHADOWFAX AND THE HORSE SET OFF AT A GOOD PACE YET NOT BEYOND THE MEASURE OF THE OTHERS AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE TURNED SUDDENLY AND CHOOSING A PLACE WHERE THE BANKS WERE LOWER HE WADED THE RIVER AND THEN LED THEM AWAY DUE SOUTH INTO A FLAT LAND TREELESS AND WIDE THE WIND WENT LIKE GREY WAVES THROUGH THE ENDLESS MILES OF GRASS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ROAD OR TRACK BUT SHADOWFAX DID NOT STAY OR FALTER
HE IS STEERING A STRAIGHT COURSE NOW FOR THE HALLS OF THEODEN UNDER THE SLOPES OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS SAID GANDALF IT WILL BE QUICKER SO THE GROUND IS FIRMER IN THE EASTEMNET WHERE THE CHIEF NORTHWARD TRACK LIES ACROSS THE RIVER BUT SHADOWFAX KNOWS THE WAY THROUGH EVERY FEN AND HOLLOW
FOR MANY HOURS THEY RODE ON THROUGH THE MEADS AND RIVERLANDS OFTEN THE GRASS WAS SO HIGH THAT IT REACHED ABOVE THE KNEES OF THE RIDERS AND THEIR STEEDS SEEMED TO BE SWIMMING IN A GREYGREEN SEA THEY CAME UPON MANY HIDDEN POOLS AND BROAD ACRES OF SEDGE WAVING ABOVE WET AND TREACHEROUS BOGS BUT SHADOWFAX FOUND THE WAY AND THE OTHER HORSES FOLLOWED IN HIS SWATH SLOWLY THE SUN FELL FROM THE SKY DOWN INTO THE WEST LOOKING OUT OVER THE GREAT PLAIN FAR AWAY THE RIDERS SAW IT FOR A MOMENT LIKE A RED FIRE SINKING INTO THE GRASS LOW UPON THE EDGE OF SIGHT SHOULDERS OF THE MOUNTAINS GLINTED RED UPON EITHER SIDE A SMOKE SEEMED TO RISE UP AND DARKEN THE SUNS DISC TO THE HUE OF BLOOD AS IF IT HAD KINDLED THE GRASS AS IT PASSED DOWN UNDER THE RIM OF EARTH
THERE LIES THE GAP OF ROHAN SAID GANDALF IT IS NOW ALMOST DUE WEST OF US THAT WAY LIES ISENGARD
I SEE A GREAT SMOKE SAID LEGOLAS WHAT MAY THAT BE
BATTLE AND WAR SAID GANDALF RIDE ON



CHAPTER 6
THE KING OF THE GOLDEN HALL

HOURS PASSED AND STILL THEY RODE ON GIMLI NODDED AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN FROM HIS SEAT IF GANDALF HAD NOT CLUTCHED AND SHAKEN HIM HASUFEL AND AROD WEARY BUT PROUD FOLLOWED THEIR TIRELESS LEADER A GREY SHADOW BEFORE THEM HARDLY TO HE SEEN THE MILES WENT BY THE WAXING MOON SANK INTO THE CLOUDY WEST
A BITTER CHILL CAME INTO THE AIR SLOWLY IN THE EAST THE DARK FADED TO A COLD GREY RED SHAFTS OF LIGHT LEAPT ABOVE THE BLACK WALLS OF THE EMYN MUIL FAR AWAY UPON THEIR LEFT DAWN CAME CLEAR AND BRIGHT A WIND SWEPT ACROSS THEIR PATH RUSHING THROUGH THE BENT GRASSES SUDDENLY SHADOWFAX STOOD STILL AND NEIGHED GANDALF POINTED AHEAD
LOOK HE CRIED AND THEY LIFTED THEIR TIRED EYES BEFORE THEM STOOD THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SOUTH WHITETIPPED AND STREAKED WITH BLACK THE GRASSLANDS ROLLED AGAINST THE HILLS THAT CLUSTERED AT THEIR FEET AND FLOWED UP INTO MANY VALLEYS STILL DIM AND DARK UNTOUCHED BY THE LIGHT OF DAWN WINDING THEIR WAY INTO THE HEART OF THE GREAT MOUNTAINS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE TRAVELLERS THE WIDEST OF THESE GLENS OPENED LIKE A LONG GULF AMONG THE HILLS FAR INWARD THEY GLIMPSED A TUMBLED MOUNTAINMASS WITH ONE TALL PEAK AT THE MOUTH OF THE VALE THERE STOOD LIKE SENTINEL A LONELY HEIGHT ABOUT ITS FEET THERE FLOWED AS A THREAD OF SILVER THE STREAM THAT ISSUED FROM THE DALE UPON ITS BROW THEY CAUGHT STILL FAR AWAY A GLINT IN THE RISING SUN A GLIMMER OF GOLD SPEAK LEGOLAS SAID GANDALF TELL US WHAT YOU SEE THERE BEFORE US
LEGOLAS GAZED AHEAD SHADING HIS EYES FROM THE LEVEL SHAFTS OF THE NEWRISEN SUN I SEE A WHITE STREAM THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE SNOWS HE SAID WHERE IT ISSUES FROM THE SHADOW OF THE VALE A GREEN HILL RISES UPON THE EAST A DIKE AND MIGHTY WALL AND THORNY FENCE ENCIRCLE IT WITHIN THERE RISE THE ROOFS OF HOUSES AND IN THE MIDST SET UPON A GREEN TERRACE THERE STANDS ALOFT A GREAT HALL OF MEN AND IT SEEMS TO MY EYES THAT IT IS THATCHED WITH GOLD THE LIGHT OF IT SHINES FAR OVER THE LAND GOLDEN TOO ARE THE POSTS OF ITS DOORS THERE MEN IN BRIGHT MAIL STAND BUT ALL ELSE WITHIN THE COURTS ARE YET ASLEEP
EDORAS THOSE COURTS ARE CALLED SAID GANDALF AND MEDUSELD IS THAT GOLDEN HALL THERE DWELLS THEODEN SON OF THENGEL KING OF THE MARK OF ROHAN WE ARE COME WITH THE RISING OF THE DAY NOW THE ROAD LIES PLAIN TO SEE BEFORE US BUT WE MUST RIDE MORE WARILY FOR WAR IS ABROAD AND THE ROHIRRIM THE HORSELORDS DO NOT SLEEP EVEN IF IT SEEM SO FROM AFAR DRAW NO WEAPON SPEAK NO HAUGHTY WORD I COUNSEL YOU ALL UNTIL WE ARE COME BEFORE THEODENS SEAT
THE MORNING WAS BRIGHT AND CLEAR ABOUT THEM AND BIRDS WERE SINGING WHEN THE TRAVELLERS CAME TO THE STREAM IT RAN DOWN SWIFTLY INTO THE PLAIN AND BEYOND THE FEET OF THE HILLS TURNED ACROSS THEIR PATH IN A WIDE BEND FLOWING AWAY EAST TO FEED THE ENTWASH FAR OFF IN ITS REEDCHOKED BEDS THE LAND WAS GREEN IN THE WET MEADS AND ALONG THE GRASSY BORDERS OF THE STREAM GREW MANY WILLOWTREES ALREADY IN THIS SOUTHERN LAND THEY WERE BLUSHING RED AT THEIR FINGERTIPS FEELING THE APPROACH OF SPRING OVER THE STREAM THERE WAS A FORD BETWEEN LOW BANKS MUCH TRAMPLED BY THE PASSAGE OF HORSES THE TRAVELLERS PASSED OVER AND CAME UPON A WIDE RUTTED TRACK LEADING TOWARDS THE UPLANDS
AT THE FOOT OF THE WALLED HILL THE WAY RAN UNDER THE SHADOW OF MANY MOUNDS HIGH AND GREEN UPON THEIR WESTERN SIDES THE GRASS WAS WHITE AS WITH A DRIFTED SNOW SMALL FLOWERS SPRANG THERE LIKE COUNTLESS STARS AMID THE TURF
LOOK SAID GANDALF HOW FAIR ARE THE BRIGHT EYES IN THE GRASS EVERMIND THEY ARE CALLED SIMBELMYNE IN THIS LAND OF MEN FOR THEY BLOSSOM IN ALL THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR AND GROW WHERE DEAD MEN REST BEHOLD WE ARE COME TO THE GREAT BARROWS WHERE THE SIRES OF THEODEN SLEEP
SEVEN MOUNDS UPON THE LEFT AND NINE UPON THE RIGHT SAID ARAGORN MANY LONG LIVES OF MEN IT IS SINCE THE GOLDEN HALL WAS BUILT
FIVE HUNDRED TIMES HAVE THE RED LEAVES FALLEN IN MIRKWOOD IN MY HOME SINCE THEN SAID LEGOLAS AND BUT A LITTLE WHILE DOES THAT SEEM TO US
BUT TO THE RIDERS OF THE MARK IT SEEMS SO LONG AGO SAID ARAGORN THAT THE RAISING OF THIS HOUSE IS BUT A MEMORY OF SONG AND THE YEARS BEFORE ARE LOST IN THE MIST OF TIME NOW THEY CALL THIS LAND THEIR HOME THEIR OWN AND THEIR SPEECH IS SUNDERED FROM THEIR NORTHERN KIN THEN HE BEGAN TO CHANT SOFTLY IN A SLOW TONGUE UNKNOWN TO THE ELF AND DWARF YET THEY LISTENED FOR THERE WAS A STRONG MUSIC IN IT
THAT I GUESS IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE ROHIRRIM SAID LEGOLAS FOR IT IS LIKE TO THIS LAND ITSELF RICH AND ROLLING IN PART AND ELSE HARD AND STERN AS THE MOUNTAINS BUT I CANNOT GUESS WHAT IT MEANS SAVE THAT IT IS LADEN WITH THE SADNESS OF MORTAL MEN
IT RUNS THUS IN THE COMMON SPEECH SAID ARAGORN AS NEAR AS I CAN MAKE IT
WHERE NOW THE HORSE AND THE RIDER WHERE IS THE HORN THAT WAS BLOWING
WHERE IS THE HELM AND THE HAUBERK AND THE BRIGHT HAIR FLOWING
WHERE IS THE HAND ON THE HARPSTRING AND THE RED FIRE GLOWING
WHERE IS THE SPRING AND THE HARVEST AND THE TALL CORN GROWING
THEY HAVE PASSED LIKE RAIN ON THE MOUNTAIN LIKE A WIND IN THE MEADOW
THE DAYS HAVE GONE DOWN IN THE WEST BEHIND THE HILLS INTO SHADOW
WHO SHALL GATHER THE SMOKE OF THE DEAD WOOD BURNING
OR BEHOLD THE FLOWING YEARS FROM THE SEA RETURNING

THUS SPOKE A FORGOTTEN POET LONG AGO IN ROHAN RECALLING HOW TALL AND FAIR WAS EORL THE YOUNG WHO RODE DOWN OUT OF THE NORTH AND THERE WERE WINGS UPON THE FEET OF HIS STEED FELAROF FATHER OF HORSES SO MEN STILL SING IN THE EVENING
WITH THESE WORDS THE TRAVELLERS PASSED THE SILENT MOUNDS FOLLOWING THE WINDING WAY UP THE GREEN SHOULDERS OF THE HILLS THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE WIDE WINDSWEPT WALLS AND THE GATES OF EDORAS
THERE SAT MANY MEN IN BRIGHT MAIL WHO SPRANG AT ONCE TO THEIR FEET AND BARRED THE WAY WITH SPEARS STAY STRANGERS HERE UNKNOWN THEY CRIED IN THE TONGUE OF THE RIDDERMARK DEMANDING THE NAMES AND ERRAND OF THE STRANGERS WONDER WAS IN THEIR EYES BUT LITTLE FRIENDLINESS AND THEY LOOKED DARKLY UPON GANDALF
WELL DO I UNDERSTAND YOUR SPEECH HE ANSWERED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE YET FEW STRANGERS DO SO WHY THEN DO YOU NOT SPEAK IN THE COMMON TONGUE AS IS THE CUSTOM IN THE WEST IF YOU WISH TO BE ANSWERED
IT IS THE WILL OF THEODEN KING THAT NONE SHOULD ENTER HIS GATES SAVE THOSE WHO KNOW OUR TONGUE AND ARE OUR FRIENDS REPLIED ONE OF THE GUARDS NONE ARE WELCOME HERE IN DAYS OF WAR BUT OUR OWN FOLK AND THOSE THAT COME FROM MUNDBURG IN THE LAND OF GONDOR WHO ARE YOU THAT COME HEEDLESS OVER THE PLAIN THUS STRANGELY CLAD RIDING HORSES LIKE TO OUR OWN HORSES LONG HAVE WE KEPT GUARD HERE AND WE HAVE WATCHED YOU FROM AFAR NEVER HAVE WE SEEN OTHER RIDERS SO STRANGE NOR ANY HORSE MORE PROUD THAN IS ONE OF THESE THAT BEAR YOU HE IS ONE OF THE MEARAS UNLESS OUR EYES ARE CHEATED BY SOME SPELL SAY ARE YOU NOT A WIZARD SOME SPY FROM SARUMAN OR PHANTOMS OF HIS CRAFT SPEAK NOW AND BE SWIFT

THE DARK GATES WERE SWUNG OPEN THE TRAVELLERS ENTERED WALKING IN FILE BEHIND THEIR GUIDE THEY FOUND A BROAD PATH PAVED WITH HEWN STONES NOW WINDING UPWARD NOW CLIMBING IN SHORT FLIGHTS OF WELLLAID STEPS MANY HOUSES BUILT OF WOOD AND MANY DARK DOORS THEY PASSED BESIDE THE WAY IN A STONE CHANNEL A STREAM OF CLEAR WATER FLOWED SPARKLING AND CHATTERING AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO THE CROWN OF THE HILL THERE STOOD A HIGH PLATFORM ABOVE A GREEN TERRACE AT THE FOOT OF WHICH A BRIGHT SPRING GUSHED FROM A STONE CARVED IN THE LIKENESS OF A HORSES HEAD BENEATH WAS A WIDE BASIN FROM WHICH THE WATER SPILLED AND FED THE FALLING STREAM UP THE GREEN TERRACE WENT A STAIR OF STONE HIGH AND BROAD AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TOPMOST STEP WERE STONEHEWN SEA THERE SAT OTHER GUARDS WITH DRAWN SWORDS LAID UPON THEIR KNEES THEIR GOLDEN HAIR WAS BRAIDED ON THEIR SHOULDERS THE SUN WAS BLAZONED UPON THEIR GREEN SHIELDS THEIR LONG CORSLETS WERE BURNISHED BRIGHT AND WHEN THEY ROSE TALLER THEY SEEMED THAN MORTAL MEN
THERE ARE THE DOORS BEFORE YOU SAID THE GUIDE I MUST RETURN NOW TO MY DUTY AT THE GATE FAREWELL AND MAY THE LORD OF THE MARK BE GRACIOUS TO YOU
HE TURNED AND WENT SWIFTLY BACK DOWN THE ROAD THE OTHERS CLIMBED THE LONG STAIR UNDER THE EYES OF THE TALL WATCHMEN SILENT THEY STOOD NOW ABOVE AND SPOKE NO WORD UNTIL GANDALF STEPPED OUT UPON THE PAVED TERRACE AT THE STAIRS HEAD THEN SUDDENLY WITH CLEAR VOICES THEY SPOKE A COURTEOUS GREETING IN THEIR OWN TONGUE
HAIL COMERS FROM AFAR THEY SAID AND THEY TURNED THE HILTS OF THEIR SWORDS TOWARDS THE TRAVELLERS IN TOKEN OF PEACE GREEN GEMS FLASHED IN THE SUNLIGHT THEN ONE OF THE GUARDS STEPPED FORWARD AND SPOKE IN THE COMMON SPEECH
I AM THE DOORWARD OF THEODEN HE SAID HAMA IS MY NAME HERE I MUST BID YOU LAY ASIDE YOUR WEAPONS BEFORE YOU ENTER
THEN LEGOLAS GAVE INTO HIS HAND HIS SILVERHAFTED KNIFE HIS QUIVER AND HIS BOW KEEP THESE WELL HE SAID FOR THEY COME FROM THE GOLDEN WOOD AND THE LADY OF LOTHLORIEN GAVE THEM TO ME
WONDER CAME INTO THE MANS EYES AND HE LAID THE WEAPONS HASTILY BY THE WALL AS IF HE FEARED TO HANDLE THEM NO MAN WILL TOUCH THEM I PROMISE YOU HE SAID
ARAGORN STOOD A WHILE HESITATING IT IS NOT MY WILL HE SAID TO PUT ASIDE MY SWORD OR TO DELIVER ANDURIL TO THE HAND OF ANY OTHER MAN
IT IS THE WILL OF THEODEN SAID HAMA
IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT THE WILL OF THEODEN SON OF THENGEL EVEN THOUGH HE BE LORD OF THE MARK SHOULD PREVAIL OVER THE WILL OF ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN ELENDILS HEIR OF GONDOR
THIS IS THE HOUSE OF THEODEN NOT OF ARAGORN EVEN WERE HE KING OF GONDOR IN THE SEAT OF DENETHOR SAID HAMA STEPPING SWIFTLY BEFORE THE DOORS AND BARRING THE WAY HIS SWORD WAS NOW IN HIS HAND AND THE POINT TOWARDS THE STRANGERS
THIS IS IDLE TALK SAID GANDALF NEEDLESS IS THEODENS DEMAND BUT IT IS USELESS TO REFUSE A KING WILL HAVE HIS WAY IN HIS OWN HALL BE IT FOLLY OR WISDOM
TRULY SAID ARAGORN AND I WOULD DO AS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE BADE ME WERE THIS ONLY A WOODMANS COT IF I BORE NOW ANY SWORD BUT ANDURIL
WHATEVER ITS NAME MAY BE SAID HAMA HERE YOU SHALL LAY IT IF YOU WOULD NOT FIGHT ALONE AGAINST ALL THE MEN IN EDORAS

THE GUARD STEPPED BACK AND LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT ON ARAGORN IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE COME ON THE WINGS OF SONG OUT OF THE FORGOTTEN DAYS HE SAID IT SHALL BE LORD AS YOU COMMAND
WELL SAID GIMLI IF IT HAS ANDURIL TO KEEP IT COMPANY MY AXE MAY STAY HERE TOO WITHOUT SHAME AND HE LAID IT ON THE FLOOR NOW THEN IF ALL IS AS YOU WISH LET US GO AND SPEAK WITH YOUR MASTER
THE GUARD STILL HESITATED YOUR STAFF HE SAID TO GANDALF FORGIVE ME BUT THAT TOO MUST BE LEFT AT THE DOORS
FOOLISHNESS SAID GANDALF PRUDENCE IS ONE THING BUT DISCOURTESY IS ANOTHER I AM OLD IF I MAY NOT LEAN ON MY STICK AS I GO THEN I WILL SIT OUT HERE UNTIL IT PLEASES THEODEN TO HOBBLE OUT HIMSELF TO SPEAK WITH ME
ARAGORN LAUGHED EVERY MAN HAS SOMETHING TOO DEAR TO TRUST TO ANOTHER BUT WOULD YOU PART AN OLD MAN FROM HIS SUPPORT COME WILL YOU NOT LET US ENTER
THE STAFF IN THE HAND OF A WIZARD MAY BE MORE THAN A PROP FOR AGE SAID HAMA HE LOOKED HARD AT THE ASHSTAFF ON WHICH GANDALF LEANED YET IN DOUBT A MAN OF WORTH WILL TRUST TO HIS OWN WISDOM I BELIEVE YOU ARE FRIENDS AND FOLK WORTHY OF HONOUR WHO HAVE NO EVIL PURPOSE YOU MAY GO IN
THE GUARDS NOW LIFTED THE HEAVY BARS OF THE DOORS AND SWUNG THEM SLOWLY INWARDS GRUMBLING ON THEIR GREAT HINGES THE TRAVELLERS ENTERED INSIDE IT SEEMED DARK AND WARM AFTER THE CLEAR AIR UPON THE HILL THE HALL WAS LONG AND WIDE AND FILLED WITH SHADOWS AND HALF LIGHTS MIGHTY PILLARS UPHELD ITS LOFTY ROOF BUT HERE AND THERE BRIGHT SUNBEAMS FELL IN GLIMMERING SHAFTS FROM THE EASTERN WINDOWS HIGH UNDER THE DEEP EAVES THROUGH THE LOUVER IN THE ROOF ABOVE THE THIN WISPS OF ISSUING SMOKE THE SKY SHOWED PALE AND BLUE AS THEIR EYES CHANGED THE TRAVELLERS PERCEIVED THAT THE FLOOR WAS PAVED WITH STONES OF MANY HUES BRANCHING RUNES AND STRANGE DEVICES INTERTWINED BENEATH THEIR FEET THEY SAW NOW THAT THE PILLARS WERE RICHLY CARVED GLEAMING DULLY WITH GOLD AND HALFSEEN COLOURS MANY WOVEN CLOTHS WERE HUNG UPON THE WALLS AND OVER THEIR WIDE SPACES MARCHED FIGURES OF ANCIENT LEGEND SOME DIM WITH YEARS SOME DARKLING IN THE SHADE BUT UPON ONE FORM THE SUNLIGHT FELL A YOUNG MAN UPON A WHITE HORSE HE WAS BLOWING A GREAT HORN AND HIS YELLOW HAIR WAS FLYING IN THE WIND THE HORSES HEAD WAS LIFTED AND ITS NOSTRILS WERE WIDE AND RED AS IT NEIGHED SMELLING BATTLE AFAR FOAMING WATER GREEN AND WHITE RUSHED AND CURLED ABOUT ITS KNEES

FROM THE KINGS HAND THE BLACK STAFF FELL CLATTERING ON THE STONES HE DREW HIMSELF UP SLOWLY AS A MAN THAT IS STIFF FROM LONG BENDING OVER SOME DULL TOIL NOW TALL AND STRAIGHT HE STOOD AND HIS EYES WERE BLUE AS HE LOOKED INTO THE OPENING SKY

THAT MAY BE I WILL DO AS YOU ASK CALL HAMA TO ME SINCE HE PROVED UNTRUSTY AS A DOORWARD LET HIM BECOME AN ERRANDRUNNER THE GUILTY SHALL BRING THE GUILTY TO JUDGEMENT SAID THEODEN AND HIS VOICE WAS GRIM YET HE LOOKED AT GANDALF AND SMILED AND AS HE DID SO MANY LINES OF CARE WERE SMOOTHED AWAY AND DID NOT RETURN
WHEN HAMA HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND HAD GONE GANDALF LED THEODEN TO A STONE SEAT AND THEN SAT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING UPON THE TOPMOST STAIR ARAGORN AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD NEARBY
THERE IS NO TIME TO TELL ALL THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR SAID GANDALF YET IF MY HOPE IS NOT CHEATED A TIME WILL COME ERE LONG WHEN I CAN SPEAK MORE FULLY BEHOLD YOU ARE COME INTO A PERIL GREATER EVEN THAN THE WIT OF WORMTONGUE COULD WEAVE INTO YOUR DREAMS BUT SEE YOU DREAM NO LONGER YOU LIVE GONDOR AND ROHAN DO NOT STAND ALONE THE ENEMY IS STRONG BEYOND OUR RECKONING YET WE HAVE A HOPE AT WHICH HE HAS NOT GUESSED

SLOWLY THEODEN SAT DOWN AGAIN AS IF WEARINESS STILL STRUGGLED TO MASTER HIM AGAINST THE WILL OF GANDALF HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIS GREAT HOUSE ALAS HE SAID THAT THESE EVIL DAYS SHOULD BE MINE AND SHOULD COME IN MY OLD AGE INSTEAD OF THAT PEACE WHICH I HAVE EARNED ALAS FOR BOROMIR THE BRAVE THE YOUNG PERISH AND THE OLD LINGER WITHERING HE CLUTCHED HIS KNEES WITH HIS WRINKLED HANDS

CHAPTER 7
HELMS DEEP

THE SUN WAS ALREADY WESTERING AS THEY RODE FROM EDORAS AND THE LIGHT OF IT WAS IN THEIR EYES TURNING ALL THE ROLLING FIELDS OF ROHAN TO A GOLDEN HAZE THERE WAS A BEATEN WAY NORTHWESTWARD ALONG THE FOOTHILLS OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND THIS THEY FOLLOWED UP AND DOWN IN A GREEN COUNTRY CROSSING SMALL SWIFT STREAMS BY MANY FORDS FAR AHEAD AND TO THEIR RIGHT THE MISTY MOUNTAINS LOOMED EVER DARKER AND TALLER THEY GREW AS THE MILES WENT BY THE SUN WENT SLOWLY DOWN BEFORE THEM EVENING CAME BEHIND
THE HOST RODE ON NEED DROVE THEM FEARING TO COME TOO LATE THEY RODE WITH ALL THE SPEED THEY COULD PAUSING SELDOM SWIFT AND ENDURING WERE THE STEEDS OF ROHAN BUT THERE WERE MANY LEAGUES TO GO FORTY LEAGUES AND MORE IT WAS AS A BIRD FLIES FROM EDORAS TO THE FORDS OF THE ISEN WHERE THEY HOPED TO FIND THE KINGS MEN THAT HELD BACK THE HOSTS OF SARUMAN
NIGHT CLOSED ABOUT THEM AT LAST THEY HALTED TO MAKE THEIR CAMP THEY HAD RIDDEN FOR SOME FIVE HOURS AND WERE FAR OUT UPON THE WESTERN PLAIN YET MORE THAN HALF THEIR JOURNEY LAY STILL BEFORE THEM IN A GREAT CIRCLE UNDER THE STARRY SKY AND THE WAXING MOON THEY NOW MADE THEIR BIVOUAC THEY LIT NO FIRES FOR THEY WERE UNCERTAIN OF EVENTS BUT THEY SET A RING OF MOUNTED GUARDS ABOUT THEM AND SCOUTS RODE OUT FAR AHEAD PASSING LIKE SHADOWS IN THE FOLDS OF THE LAND THE SLOW NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT TIDINGS OR ALARM AT DAWN THE HORNS SOUNDED AND WITHIN AN HOUR THEY TOOK THE ROAD AGAIN
THERE WERE NO CLOUDS OVERHEAD YET BUT A HEAVINESS WAS IN THE AIR IT WAS HOT FOR THE SEASON OF THE YEAR THE RISING SUN WAS HAZY AND BEHIND IT FOLLOWING IT SLOWLY UP THE SKY THERE WAS A GROWING DARKNESS AS OF A GREAT STORM MOVING OUT OF THE EAST AND AWAY IN THE NORTHWEST THERE SEEMED TO BE ANOTHER DARKNESS BROODING ABOUT THE FEET OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS A SHADOW THAT CREPT DOWN SLOWLY FROM THE WIZARDS VALE
GANDALF DROPPED BACK TO WHERE LEGOLAS RODE BESIDE EOMER YOU HAVE THE KEEN EYES OF YOUR FAIR KINDRED LEGOLAS HE SAID AND THEY CAN TELL A SPARROW FROM A FINCH A LEAGUE OFF TELL ME CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING AWAY YONDER TOWARDS ISENGARD
MANY MILES LIE BETWEEN SAID LEGOLAS GAZING THITHER AND SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS LONG HAND I CAN SEE A DARKNESS THERE ARE SHAPES MOVING IN IT GREAT SHAPES FAR AWAY UPON THE BANK OF THE RIVER BUT WHAT THEY ARE I CANNOT TELL IT IS NOT MIST OR CLOUD THAT DEFEATS MY EYES THERE IS A VEILING SHADOW THAT SOME POWER LAYS UPON THE LAND AND IT MARCHES SLOWLY DOWN STREAM IT IS AS IF THE TWILIGHT UNDER ENDLESS TREES WERE FLOWING DOWNWARDS FROM THE HILLS
AND BEHIND US COMES A VERY STORM OF MORDOR SAID GANDALF IT WILL BE A BLACK NIGHT
AS THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR RIDING DREW ON THE HEAVINESS IN THE AIR INCREASED IN THE AFTERNOON THE DARK CLOUDS BEGAN TO OVERTAKE THEM A SOMBRE CANOPY WITH GREAT BILLOWING EDGES FLECKED WITH DAZZLING LIGHT THE SUN WENT DOWN BLOODRED IN A SMOKING HAZE THE SPEARS OF THE RIDERS WERE TIPPED WITH FIRE AS THE LAST SHAFTS OF LIGHT KINDLED THE STEEP FACES OF THE PEAKS OF THRIHYRNE NOW VERY NEAR THEY STOOD ON THE NORTHERNMOST ARM OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS THREE JAGGED HORNS STARING AT THE SUNSET IN THE LAST RED GLOW MEN IN THE VANGUARD SAW A BLACK SPECK A HORSEMAN RIDING BACK TOWARDS THEM THEY HALTED AWAITING HIM
HE CAME A WEARY MAN WITH DINTED HELM AND CLOVEN SHIELD SLOWLY HE CLIMBED FROM HIS HORSE AND STOOD THERE A WHILE GASPING AT LENGTH HE SPOKE IS EOMER HERE HE ASKED YOU COME AT LAST BUT TOO LATE AND WITH TOO LITTLE STRENGTH THINGS HAVE GONE EVILLY SINCE THEODRED FELL WE WERE DRIVEN BACK YESTERDAY OVER THE ISEN WITH GREAT LOSS MANY PERISHED AT THE CROSSING THEN AT NIGHT FRESH FORCES CAME OVER THE RIVER AGAINST OUR CAMP ALL ISENGARD MUST BE EMPTIED AND SARUMAN HAS ARMED THE WILD HILLMEN AND HERDFOLK OF DUNLAND BEYOND THE RIVERS AND THESE ALSO HE LOOSED UPON US WE WERE OVERMASTERED THE SHIELDWALL WAS BROKEN ERKENBRAND OF WESTFOLD HAS DRAWN OFF THOSE MEN HE COULD GATHER TOWARDS HIS FASTNESS IN HELMS DEEP THE REST ARE SCATTERED
WHERE IS EOMER TELL HIM THERE IS NO HOPE AHEAD HE SHOULD RETURN TO EDORAS BEFORE THE WOLVES OF ISENGARD COME THERE THEODEN HAD SAT SILENT HIDDEN FROM THE MANS SIGHT BEHIND HIS GUARDS NOW HE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD COME STAND BEFORE ME CEORL HE SAID I AM HERE THE LAST HOST OF THE EORLINGAS HAS RIDDEN FORTH IT WILL NOT RETURN WITHOUT BATTLE
THE MANS FACE LIGHTENED WITH JOY AND WONDER HE DREW HIMSELF UP THEN HE KNELT OFFERING HIS NOTCHED SWORD TO THE KING COMMAND ME LORD HE CRIED AND PARDON ME I THOUGHT
YOU THOUGHT I REMAINED IN MEDUSELD BENT LIKE AN OLD TREE UNDER WINTER SNOW SO IT WAS WHEN YOU RODE TO WAR BUT A WEST WIND HAS SHAKEN THE BOUGHS SAID THEODEN GIVE THIS MAN A FRESH HORSE LET US RIDE TO THE HELP OF ERKENBRAND
WHILE THEODEN WAS SPEAKING GANDALF RODE A SHORT WAY AHEAD AND HE SAT THERE ALONE GAZING NORTH TO ISENGARD AND WEST TO THE SETTING SUN NOW HE CAME BACK
RIDE THEODEN HE SAID RIDE TO HELMS DEEP GO NOT TO THE FORDS OF ISEN AND DO NOT TARRY IN THE PLAIN I MUST LEAVE YOU FOR A WHILE SHADOWFAX MUST BEAR ME NOW ON A SWIFT ERRAND TURNING TO ARAGORN AND EOMER AND THE MEN OF THE KINGS HOUSEHOLD HE CRIED KEEP WELL THE LORD OF THE MARK TILL I RETURN AWAIT ME AT HELMS GATE FAREWELL
HE SPOKE A WORD TO SHADOWFAX AND LIKE AN ARROW FROM THE BOW THE GREAT HORSE SPRANG AWAY EVEN AS THEY LOOKED HE WAS GONE A FLASH OF SILVER IN THE SUNSET A WIND OVER THE GRASS A SHADOW THAT FLED AND PASSED FROM SIGHT SNOWMANE SNORTED AND REARED EAGER TO FOLLOW BUT ONLY A SWIFT BIRD ON THE WING COULD HAVE OVERTAKEN HIM
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SAID ONE OF THE GUARD TO HAMA
THAT GANDALF GREYHAME HAS NEED OF HASTE ANSWERED HAMA EVER HE GOES AND COMES UNLOOKEDFOR
WORMTONGUE WERE HE HERE WOULD NOT FIND IT HARD TO EXPLAIN SAID THE OTHER
TRUE ENOUGH SAID HAMA BUT FOR MYSELF I WILL WAIT UNTIL I SEE GANDALF AGAIN
MAYBE YOU WILL WAIT LONG SAID THE OTHER
THE HOST TURNED AWAY NOW FROM THE ROAD TO THE FORDS OF ISEN AND BENT THEIR COURSE SOUTHWARD NIGHT FELL AND STILL THEY RODE ON THE HILLS DREW NEAR BUT THE TALL PEAKS OF THRIHYRNE WERE ALREADY DIM AGAINST THE DARKENING SKY STILL SOME MILES AWAY ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE WESTFOLD VALE LAY A GREEN COOMB A GREAT BAY IN THE MOUNTAINS OUT OF WHICH A GORGE OPENED IN THE HILLS MEN OF THAT LAND CALLED IT HELMS DEEP AFTER A HERO OF OLD WARS WHO HAD MADE HIS REFUGE THERE EVER STEEPER AND NARROWER IT WOUND INWARD FROM THE NORTH UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE THRIHYRNE TILL THE CROWHAUNTED CLIFFS ROSE LIKE MIGHTY TOWERS ON EITHER SIDE SHUTTING OUT THE LIGHT
AT HELMS GATE BEFORE THE MOUTH OF THE DEEP THERE WAS A HEEL OF ROCK THRUST OUTWARD BY THE NORTHERN CLIFF THERE UPON ITS SPUR STOOD HIGH WALLS OF ANCIENT STONE AND WITHIN THEM WAS A LOFTY TOWER MEN SAID THAT IN THE FAROFF DAYS OF THE GLORY OF GONDOR THE SEAKINGS HAD BUILT HERE THIS FASTNESS WITH THE HANDS OF GIANTS THE HORNBURG IT WAS CALLED FOR A TRUMPET SOUNDED UPON THE TOWER ECHOED IN THE DEEP BEHIND AS IF ARMIES LONGFORGOTTEN WERE ISSUING TO WAR FROM CAVES BENEATH THE HILLS A WALL TOO THE MEN OF OLD HAD MADE FROM THE HORNBURG TO THE SOUTHERN CLIFF BARRING THE ENTRANCE TO THE GORGE BENEATH IT BY A WIDE CULVERT THE DEEPINGSTREAM PASSED OUT ABOUT THE FEET OF THE HORNROCK IT WOUND AND FLOWED THEN IN A GULLY THROUGH THE MIDST OF A WIDE GREEN GORE SLOPING GENTLY DOWN FROM HELMS GATE TO HELMS DIKE THENCE IT FELL INTO THE DEEPINGCOOMB AND OUT INTO THE WESTFOLD VALE THERE IN THE HORNBURG AT HELMS GATE ERKENBRAND MASTER OF WESTFOLD ON THE BORDERS OF THE MARK NOW DWELT AS THE DAYS DARKENED WITH THREAT OF WAR BEING WISE HE HAD REPAIRED THE WALL AND MADE THE FASTNESS STRONG
THE RIDERS WERE STILL IN THE LOW VALLEY BEFORE THE MOUTH OF THE COOMB WHEN CRIES AND HORNBLASTS WERE HEARD FROM THEIR SCOUTS THAT WENT IN FRONT OUT OF THE DARKNESS ARROWS WHISTLED SWIFTLY A SCOUT RODE BACK AND REPORTED THAT WOLFRIDERS WERE ABROAD IN THE VALLEY AND THAT A HOST OF ORCS AND WILD MEN WERE HURRYING SOUTHWARD FROM THE FORDS OF ISEN AND SEEMED TO BE MAKING FOR HELMS DEEP
WE HAVE FOUND MANY OF OUR FOLK LYING SLAIN AS THEY FLED THITHER SAID THE SCOUT AND WE HAVE MET SCATTERED COMPANIES GOING THIS WAY AND THAT LEADERLESS WHAT HAS BECOME OF ERKENBRAND NONE SEEM TO KNOW IT IS LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE OVERTAKEN ERE HE CAN REACH HELMS GATE IF HE HAS NOT ALREADY PERISHED
HAS AUGHT BEEN SEEN OF GANDALF ASKED THEODEN
YES LORD MANY HAVE SEEN AN OLD MAN IN WHITE UPON A HORSE PASSING HITHER AND THITHER OVER THE PLAINS LIKE WIND IN THE GRASS SOME THOUGHT HE WAS SARUMAN IT IS SAID THAT HE WENT AWAY ERE NIGHTFALL TOWARDS ISENGARD SOME SAY ALSO THAT WORMTONGUE WAS SEEN EARLIER GOING NORTHWARD WITH A COMPANY OF ORCS
IT WILL GO ILL WITH WORMTONGUE IF GANDALF COMES UPON HIM SAID THEODEN NONETHELESS I MISS NOW BOTH MY COUNSELLORS THE OLD AND THE NEW BUT IN THIS NEED WE HAVE NO BETTER CHOICE THAN TO GO ON AS GANDALF SAID TO HELMS GATE WHETHER ERKENBRAND BE THERE OR NO IS IT KNOWN HOW GREAT IS THE HOST THAT COMES FROM THE NORTH
IT IS VERY GREAT SAID THE SCOUT HE THAT FLIES COUNTS EVERY FOEMAN TWICE YET I HAVE SPOKEN TO STOUTHEARTED MEN AND I DO NOT DOUBT THAT THE MAIN STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY IS MANY TIMES AS GREAT AS ALL THAT WE HAVE HERE
THEN LET US BE SWIFT SAID EOMER LET US DRIVE THROUGH SUCH FOES AS ARE ALREADY BETWEEN US AND THE FASTNESS THERE ARE CAVES IN HELMS DEEP WHERE HUNDREDS MAY LIE HID AND SECRET WAYS LEAD THENCE UP ON TO THE HILLS
TRUST NOT TO SECRET WAYS SAID THE KING SARUMAN HAS LONG SPIED OUT THIS LAND STILL IN THAT PLACE OUR DEFENCE MAY LAST LONG LET US GO
ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS WENT NOW WITH EOMER IN THE VAN ON THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT THEY RODE EVER SLOWER AS THE DARKNESS DEEPENED AND THEIR WAY CLIMBED SOUTHWARD HIGHER AND HIGHER INTO THE DIM FOLDS ABOUT THE MOUNTAINS FEET THEY FOUND FEW OF THE ENEMY BEFORE THEM HERE AND THERE THEY CAME UPON ROVING BANDS OF ORCS BUT THEY FLED ERE THE RIDERS COULD TAKE OR SLAY THEM
IT WILL NOT BE LONG I FEAR SAID EOMER ERE THE COMING OF THE KINGS HOST WILL BE KNOWN TO THE LEADER OF OUR ENEMIES SARUMAN OR WHATEVER CAPTAIN HE HAS SENT FORTH
THE RUMOUR OF WAR GREW BEHIND THEM NOW THEY COULD HEAR BORNE OVER THE DARK THE SOUND OF HARSH SINGING THEY HAD CLIMBED FAR UP INTO THE DEEPINGCOOMB WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK THEN THEY SAW TORCHESCOUNTLESS POINTS OF FIERY LIGHT UPON THE BLACK FIELDS BEHIND SCATTERED LIKE RED FLOWERS OR WINDING UP FROM THE LOWLANDS IN LONG FLICKERING LINES HERE AND THERE A LARGER BLAZE LEAPT UP
IT IS A GREAT HOST AND FOLLOWS US HARD SAID ARAGORN
THEY BRING FIRE SAID THEODEN AND THEY ARE BURNING AS THEY COME RICK COT AND TREE THIS WAS A RICH VALE AND HAD MANY HOMESTEADS ALAS FOR MY FOLK
WOULD THAT DAY WAS HERE AND WE MIGHT RIDE DOWN UPON THEM LIKE A STORM OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS SAID ARAGORN IT GRIEVES ME TO FLY BEFORE THEM
WE NEED NOT FLY MUCH FURTHER SAID EOMER NOT FAR AHEAD NOW LIES HELMS DIKE AN ANCIENT TRENCH AND RAMPART SCORED ACROSS THE COOMB TWO FURLONGS BELOW HELMS GATE THERE WE CAN TURN AND GIVE BATTLE
NAY WE ARE TOO FEW TO DEFEND THE DIKE SAID THEODEN IT IS A MILE LONG OR MORE AND THE BREACH IN IT IS WIDE
AT THE BREACH OUR REARGUARD MUST STAND IF WE ARE PRESSED SAID EOMER
THERE WAS NEITHER STAR NOR MOON WHEN THE RIDERS CAME TO THE BREACH IN THE DIKE WHERE THE STREAM FROM ABOVE PASSED OUT AND THE ROAD BESIDE IT RAN DOWN FROM THE HORNBURG THE RAMPART LOOMED SUDDENLY BEFORE THEM A HIGH SHADOW BEYOND A DARK PIT AS THEY RODE UP A SENTINEL CHALLENGED THEM
THE LORD OF THE MARK RIDES TO HELMS GATE EOMER ANSWERED I EOMER SON OF EOMUND SPEAK
THIS IS GOOD TIDINGS BEYOND HOPE SAID THE SENTINEL HASTEN THE ENEMY IS ON YOUR HEELS
THE HOST PASSED THROUGH THE BREACH AND HALTED ON THE SLOPING SWARD ABOVE THEY NOW LEARNED TO THEIR JOY THAT ERKENBRAND HAD LEFT MANY MEN TO HOLD HELMS GATE AND MORE HAD SINCE ESCAPED THITHER
MAYBE WE HAVE A THOUSAND FIT TO FIGHT ON FOOT SAID GAMLING AN OLD MAN THE LEADER OF THOSE THAT WATCHED THE DIKE BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE SEEN TOO MANY WINTERS AS I HAVE OR TOO FEW AS MY SONS SON HERE WHAT NEWS OF ERKENBRAND WORD CAME YESTERDAY THAT HE WAS RETREATING HITHER WITH ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE BEST RIDERS OF WESTFOLD BUT HE HAS NOT COME
I FEAR THAT HE WILL NOT COME NOW SAID EOMER OUR SCOUTS HAVE GAINED NO NEWS OF HIM AND THE ENEMY FILLS ALL THE VALLEY BEHIND US
I WOULD THAT HE HAD ESCAPED SAID THEODEN HE WAS A MIGHTY MAN IN HIM LIVED AGAIN THE VALOUR OF HELM THE HAMMERHAND BUT WE CANNOT AWAIT HIM HERE WE MUST DRAW ALL OUR FORCES NOW BEHIND THE WALLS ARE YOU WELL STORED WE BRING LITTLE PROVISION FOR WE RODE FORTH TO OPEN BATTLE NOT TO A SIEGE
BEHIND US IN THE CAVES OF THE DEEP ARE THREE PARTS OF THE FOLK OF WESTFOLD OLD AND YOUNG CHILDREN AND WOMEN SAID GAMLING BUT GREAT STORE OF FOOD AND MANY BEASTS AND THEIR FODDER HAVE ALSO BEEN GATHERED THERE
THAT IS WELL SAID EOMER THEY ARE BURNING OR DESPOILING ALL THAT IS LEFT IN THE VALE
IF THEY COME TO BARGAIN FOR OUR GOODS AT HELMS GATE THEY WILL PAY A HIGH PRICE SAID GAMLING
THE KING AND HIS RIDERS PASSED ON BEFORE THE CAUSEWAY THAT CROSSED THE STREAM THEY DISMOUNTED IN A LONG FILE THEY LED THEIR HORSES UP THE RAMP AND PASSED WITHIN THE GATES OF THE HORNBURG THERE THEY WERE WELCOMED AGAIN WITH JOY AND RENEWED HOPE FOR NOW THERE WERE MEN ENOUGH TO MAN BOTH THE BURG AND THE BARRIER WALL
QUICKLY EOMER SET HIS MEN IN READINESS THE KING AND THE MEN OF HIS HOUSEHOLD WERE IN THE HORNBURG AND THERE ALSO WERE MANY OF THE WESTFOLDMEN BUT ON THE DEEPING WALL AND ITS TOWER AND BEHIND IT EOMER ARRAYED MOST OF THE STRENGTH THAT HE HAD FOR HERE THE DEFENCE SEEMED MORE DOUBTFUL IF THE ASSAULT WERE DETERMINED AND IN GREAT FORCE THE HORSES WERE LED FAR UP THE DEEP UNDER SUCH GUARD AS COULD BE SPARED
THE DEEPING WALL WAS TWENTY FEET HIGH AND SO THICK THAT FOUR MEN COULD WALK ABREAST ALONG THE TOP SHELTERED BY A PARAPET OVER WHICH ONLY A TALL MAN COULD LOOK HERE AND THERE WERE CLEFTS IN THE STONE THROUGH WHICH MEN COULD SHOOT THIS BATTLEMENT COULD BE REACHED BY A STAIR RUNNING DOWN FROM A DOOR IN THE OUTER COURT OF THE HORNBURG THREE FLIGHTS OF STEPS LED ALSO UP ON TO THE WALL FROM THE DEEP BEHIND BUT IN FRONT IT WAS SMOOTH AND THE GREAT STONES OF IT WERE SET WITH SUCH SKILL THAT NO FOOTHOLD COULD BE FOUND AT THEIR JOINTS AND AT THE TOP THEY HUNG OVER LIKE A SEADELVED CLIFF
GIMLI STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE BREASTWORK UPON THE WALL LEGOLAS SAT ABOVE ON THE PARAPET FINGERING HIS BOW AND PEERING OUT INTO THE GLOOM
THIS IS MORE TO MY LIKING SAID THE DWARF STAMPING ON THE STONES EVER MY HEART RISES AS WE DRAW NEAR THE MOUNTAINS THERE IS GOOD ROCK HERE THIS COUNTRY HAS TOUGH BONES I FELT THEM IN MY FEET AS WE CAME UP FROM THE DIKE GIVE ME A YEAR AND A HUNDRED OF MY KIN AND I WOULD MAKE THIS A PLACE THAT ARMIES WOULD BREAK UPON LIKE WATER
I DO NOT DOUBT IT SAID LEGOLAS BUT YOU ARE A DWARF AND DWARVES ARE STRANGE FOLK I DO NOT LIKE THIS PLACE AND I SHALL LIKE IT NO MORE BY THE LIGHT OF DAY BUT YOU COMFORT ME GIMLI AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU STANDING NIGH WITH YOUR STOUT LEGS AND YOUR HARD AXE I WISH THERE WERE MORE OF YOUR KIN AMONG US BUT EVEN MORE WOULD I GIVE FOR A HUNDRED GOOD ARCHERS OF MIRKWOOD WE SHALL NEED THEM THE ROHIRRIM HAVE GOOD BOWMEN AFTER THEIR FASHION BUT THERE ARE TOO FEW HERE TOO FEW
IT IS DARK FOR ARCHERY SAID GIMLI INDEED IT IS TIME FOR SLEEP SLEEP I FEEL THE NEED OF IT AS NEVER I THOUGHT ANY DWARF COULD RIDING IS TIRING WORK YET MY AXE IS RESTLESS IN MY HAND GIVE ME A ROW OF ORCNECKS AND ROOM TO SWING AND ALL WEARINESS WILL FALL FROM ME
A SLOW TIME PASSED FAR DOWN IN THE VALLEY SCATTERED FIRES STILL BURNED THE HOSTS OF ISENGARD WERE ADVANCING IN SILENCE NOW THEIR TORCHES COULD BE SEEN WINDING UP THE COOMB IN MANY LINES
SUDDENLY FROM THE DIKE YELLS AND SCREAMS AND THE FIERCE BATTLECRIES OF MEN BROKE OUT FLAMING BRANDS APPEARED OVER THE BRINK AND CLUSTERED THICKLY AT THE BREACH THEN THEY SCATTERED AND VANISHED MEN CAME GALLOPING BACK OVER THE FIELD AND UP THE RAMP TO THE GATE OF THE HORNBURG THE REARGUARD OF THE WESTFOLDERS HAD BEEN DRIVEN IN
THE ENEMY IS AT HAND THEY SAID WE LOOSED EVERY ARROW THAT WE HAD AND FILLED THE DIKE WITH ORCS BUT IT WILL NOT HALT THEM LONG ALREADY THEY ARE SCALING THE BANK AT MANY POINTS THICK AS MARCHING ANTS BUT WE HAVE TAUGHT THEM NOT TO CARRY TORCHES
IT WAS NOW PAST MIDNIGHT THE SKY WAS UTTERLY DARK AND THE STILLNESS OF THE HEAVY AIR FOREBODED STORM SUDDENLY THE CLOUDS WERE SEARED BY A BLINDING FLASH BRANCHED LIGHTNING SMOTE DOWN UPON THE EASTWARD HILLS FOR A STARING MOMENT THE WATCHERS ON THE WALLS SAW ALL THE SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND THE DIKE LIT WITH WHITE LIGHT IT WAS BOILING AND CRAWLING WITH BLACK SHAPES SOME SQUAT AND BROAD SOME TALL AND GRIM WITH HIGH HELMS AND SABLE SHIELDS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS MORE WERE POURING OVER THE DIKE AND THROUGH THE BREACH THE DARK TIDE FLOWED UP TO THE WALLS FROM CLIFF TO CLIFF THUNDER ROLLED IN THE VALLEY RAIN CAME LASHING DOWN
ARROWS THICK AS THE RAIN CAME WHISTLING OVER THE BATTLEMENTS AND FELL CLINKING AND GLANCING ON THE STONES SOME FOUND A MARK THE ASSAULT ON HELMS DEEP HAD BEGUN BUT NO SOUND OR CHALLENGE WAS HEARD WITHIN NO ANSWERING ARROWS CAME
THE ASSAILING HOSTS HALTED FOILED BY THE SILENT MENACE OF ROCK AND WALL EVER AND AGAIN THE LIGHTNING TORE ASIDE THE DARKNESS THEN THE ORCS SCREAMED WAVING SPEAR AND SWORD AND SHOOTING A CLOUD OF ARROWS AT ANY THAT STOOD REVEALED UPON THE BATTLEMENTS AND THE MEN OF THE MARK AMAZED LOOKED OUT AS IT SEEMED TO THEM UPON A GREAT FIELD OF DARK CORN TOSSED BY A TEMPEST OF WAR AND EVERY EAR GLINTED WITH BARBED LIGHT
BRAZEN TRUMPETS SOUNDED THE ENEMY SURGED FORWARD SOME AGAINST THE DEEPING WALL OTHER TOWARDS THE CAUSEWAY AND THE RAMP THAT LED UP TO THE HORNBURGGATES THERE THE HUGEST ORCS WERE MUSTERED AND THE WILD MEN OF THE DUNLAND FELLS A MOMENT THEY HESITATED AND THEN ON THEY CAME THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND BLAZONED UPON EVERY HELM AND SHIELD THE GHASTLY HAND OF ISENGARD WAS SEEN THEY REACHED THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCK THEY DROVE TOWARDS THE GATES
THEN AT LAST AN ANSWER CAME A STORM OF ARROWS MET THEM AND A HAIL OF STONES THEY WAVERED BROKE AND FLED BACK AND THEN CHARGED AGAIN BROKE AND CHARGED AGAIN AND EACH TIME LIKE THE INCOMING SEA THEY HALTED AT A HIGHER POINT AGAIN TRUMPETS RANG AND A PRESS OF ROARING MEN LEAPED FORTH THEY HELD THEIR GREAT SHIELDS ABOVE THEM LIKE A ROOF WHILE IN THEIR MIDST THEY BORE TWO TRUNKS OF MIGHTY TREES BEHIND THEM ORCARCHERS CROWDED SENDING A HAIL OF DARTS AGAINST THE BOWMEN ON THE WALLS THEY GAINED THE GATES THE TREES SWUNG BY STRONG ARMS SMOTE THE TIMBERS WITH A RENDING BOOM IF ANY MAN FELL CRUSHED BY A STONE HURTLING FROM ABOVE TWO OTHERS SPRANG TO TAKE HIS PLACE AGAIN AND AGAIN THE GREAT RAMS SWUNG AND CRASHED
EOMER AND ARAGORN STOOD TOGETHER ON THE DEEPING WALL THEY HEARD THE ROAR OF VOICES AND THE THUDDING OF THE RAMS AND THEN IN A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT THEY BEHELD THE PERIL OF THE GATES
COME SAID ARAGORN THIS IS THE HOUR WHEN WE DRAW SWORDS TOGETHER
RUNNING LIKE FIRE THEY SPED ALONG THE WALL AND UP THE STEPS AND PASSED INTO THE OUTER COURT UPON THE ROCK AS THEY RAN THEY GATHERED A HANDFUL OF STOUT SWORDSMEN THERE WAS A SMALL POSTERNDOOR THAT OPENED IN AN ANGLE OF THE BURGWALL ON THE WEST WHERE THE CLIFF STRETCHED OUT TO MEET IT ON THAT SIDE A NARROW PATH RAN ROUND TOWARDS THE GREAT GATE BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE SHEER BRINK OF THE ROCK TOGETHER EOMER AND ARAGORN SPRANG THROUGH THE DOOR THEIR MEN CLOSE BEHIND THE SWORDS FLASHED FROM THE SHEATH AS ONE
GUTHWINE CRIED EOMER GUTHWINE FOR THE MARK
ANDURIL CRIED ARAGORN ANDURIL FOR THE DUNEDAIN
CHARGING FROM THE SIDE THEY HURLED THEMSELVES UPON THE WILD MEN ANDURIL ROSE AND FELL GLEAMING WITH WHITE FIRE A SHOUT WENT UP FROM WALL AND TOWER ANDURIL ANDURIL GOES TO WAR THE BLADE THAT WAS BROKEN SHINES AGAIN
DISMAYED THE RAMMERS LET FALL THE TREES AND TURNED TO FIGHT BUT THE WALL OF THEIR SHIELDS WAS BROKEN AS BY A LIGHTNINGSTROKE AND THEY WERE SWEPT AWAY HEWN DOWN OR CAST OVER THE ROCK INTO THE STONY STREAM BELOW THE ORCARCHERS SHOT WILDLY AND THEN FLED
FOR A MOMENT EOMER AND ARAGORN HALTED BEFORE THE GATES THE THUNDER WAS RUMBLING IN THE DISTANCE NOW THE LIGHTNING FLICKERED STILL FAR OFF AMONG THE MOUNTAINS IN THE SOUTH A KEEN WIND WAS BLOWING FROM THE NORTH AGAIN THE CLOUDS WERE TORN AND DRIFTING AND STARS PEEPED OUT AND ABOVE THE HILLS OF THE COOMBSIDE THE WESTERING MOON RODE GLIMMERING YELLOW IN THE STORMWRACK
WE DID NOT COME TOO SOON SAID ARAGORN LOOKING AT THE GATES THEIR GREAT HINGES AND IRON BARS WERE WRENCHED AND BENT MANY OF THEIR TIMBERS WERE CRACKED
YET WE CANNOT STAY HERE BEYOND THE WALLS TO DEFEND THEM SAID EOMER LOOK HE POINTED TO THE CAUSEWAY ALREADY A GREAT PRESS OF ORCS AND MEN WERE GATHERING AGAIN BEYOND THE STREAM ARROWS WHINED AND SKIPPED ON THE STONES ABOUT THEM COME WE MUST GET BACK AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO PILE STONE AND BEAM ACROSS THE GATES WITHIN COME NOW
THEY TURNED AND RAN AT THAT MOMENT SOME DOZEN ORCS THAT HAD LAIN MOTIONLESS AMONG THE SLAIN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND CAME SILENTLY AND SWIFTLY BEHIND TWO FLUNG THEMSELVES TO THE GROUND AT EOMERS HEELS TRIPPED HIM AND IN A MOMENT THEY WERE ON TOP OF HIM BUT A SMALL DARK FIGURE THAT NONE HAD OBSERVED SPRANG OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND GAVE A HOARSE SHOUT BARUK KHAZAD KHAZAD AIMENU AN AXE SWUNG AND SWEPT BACK TWO ORCS FELL HEADLESS THE REST FLED
EOMER STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET EVEN AS ARAGORN RAN BACK TO HIS AID
THE POSTERN WAS CLOSED AGAIN THE IRON DOOR WAS BARRED AND PILED INSIDE WITH STONES WHEN ALL WERE SAFE WITHIN EOMER TURNED I THANK YOU GIMLI SON OF GLOIN HE SAID I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE WITH US IN THE SORTIE BUT OFT THE UNBIDDEN GUEST PROVES THE BEST COMPANY HOW CAME YOU THERE
I FOLLOWED YOU TO SHAKE OFF SLEEP SAID GIMLI BUT I LOOKED ON THE HILLMEN AND THEY SEEMED OVER LARGE FOR ME SO I SAT BESIDE A STONE TO SEE YOUR SWORDPLAY

TWO SAID LEGOLAS I HAVE DONE BETTER THOUGH NOW I MUST GROPE FOR SPENT ARROWS ALL MINE ARE GONE YET I MAKE MY TALE TWENTY AT THE LEAST BUT THAT IS ONLY A FEW LEAVES IN A FOREST
THE SKY NOW WAS QUICKLY CLEARING AND THE SINKING MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY BUT THE LIGHT BROUGHT LITTLE HOPE TO THE RIDERS OF THE MARK THE ENEMY BEFORE THEM SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN RATHER THAN DIMINISHED STILL MORE WERE PRESSING UP FROM THE VALLEY THROUGH THE BREACH THE SORTIE UPON THE ROCK GAINED ONLY A BRIEF RESPITE THE ASSAULT ON THE GATES WAS REDOUBLED AGAINST THE DEEPING WALL THE HOSTS OF ISENGARD ROARED LIKE A SEA ORCS AND HILLMEN SWARMED ABOUT ITS FEET FROM END TO END ROPES WITH GRAPPLING HOOKS WERE HURLED OVER THE PARAPET FASTER THAN MEN COULD CUT THEM OR FLING THEM BACK HUNDREDS OF LONG LADDERS WERE LIFTED UP MANY WERE CAST DOWN IN RUIN BUT MANY MORE REPLACED THEM AND ORCS SPRANG UP THEM LIKE APES IN THE DARK FORESTS OF THE SOUTH BEFORE THE WALLS FOOT THE DEAD AND BROKEN WERE PILED LIKE SHINGLE IN A STORM EVER HIGHER ROSE THE HIDEOUS MOUNDS AND STILL THE ENEMY CAME ON
THE MEN OF ROHAN GREW WEARY ALL THEIR ARROWS WERE SPENT AND EVERY SHAFT WAS SHOT THEIR SWORDS WERE NOTCHED AND THEIR SHIELDS WERE RIVEN THREE TIMES ARAGORN AND EOMER RALLIED THEM AND THREE TIMES ANDURIL FLAMED IN A DESPERATE CHARGE THAT DROVE THE ENEMY FROM THE WALL
THEN A CLAMOUR AROSE IN THE DEEP BEHIND ORCS HAD CREPT LIKE RATS THROUGH THE CULVERT THROUGH WHICH THE STREAM FLOWED OUT THERE THEY HAD GATHERED IN THE SHADOW OF THE CLIFFS UNTIL THE ASSAULT ABOVE WAS HOTTEST AND NEARLY ALL THE MEN OF THE DEFENCE HAD RUSHED TO THE WALLS TOP THEN THEY SPRANG OUT ALREADY SOME HAD PASSED INTO THE JAWS OF THE DEEP AND WERE AMONG THE HORSES FIGHTING WITH THE GUARDS
DOWN FROM THE WALL LEAPT GIMLI WITH A FIERCE CRY THAT ECHOED IN THE CLIFFS KHAZAD KHAZAD HE SOON HAD WORK ENOUGH
AIOI HE SHOUTED THE ORCS ARE BEHIND THE WALL AIOI COME LEGOLAS THERE ARE ENOUGH FOR US BOTH KHAZAD AIMENU
GAMLING THE OLD LOOKED DOWN FROM THE HORNBURG HEARING THE GREAT VOICE OF THE DWARF ABOVE ALL THE TUMULT THE ORCS ARE IN THE DEEP HE CRIED HELM HELM FORTH HELMINGAS HE SHOUTED AS HE LEAPED DOWN THE STAIR FROM THE ROCK WITH MANY MEN OF WESTFOLD AT HIS BACK
THEIR ONSET WAS FIERCE AND SUDDEN AND THE ORCS GAVE WAY BEFORE THEM ERE LONG THEY WERE HEMMED IN IN THE NARROWS OF THE GORGE AND ALL WERE SLAIN OR DRIVEN SHRIEKING INTO THE CHASM OF THE DEEP TO FALL BEFORE THE GUARDIANS OF THE HIDDEN CAVES
TWENTYONE CRIED GIMLI HE HEWED A TWOHANDED STROKE AND LAID THE LAST ORC BEFORE HIS FEET NOW MY COUNT PASSES MASTER LEGOLAS AGAIN
WE MUST STOP THIS RATHOLE SAID GAMLING DWARVES ARE SAID TO BE CUNNING FOLK WITH STONE LEND US YOUR AID MASTER
WE DO NOT SHAPE STONE WITH BATTLEAXES NOR WITH OUR FINGERNAILS SAID GIMLI BUT I WILL HELP AS I MAY
THEY GATHERED SUCH SMALL BOULDERS AND BROKEN STONES AS THEY COULD FIND TO HAND AND UNDER GIMLIS DIRECTION THE WESTFOLDMEN BLOCKED UP THE INNER END OF THE CULVERT UNTIL ONLY A NARROW OUTLET REMAINED THEN THE DEEPINGSTREAM SWOLLEN BY THE RAIN CHURNED AND FRETTED IN ITS CHOKED PATH AND SPREAD SLOWLY IN COLD POOLS FROM CLIFF TO CLIFF
IT WILL BE DRIER ABOVE SAID GIMLI COME GAMLING LET US SEE HOW THINGS GO ON THE WALL
HE CLIMBED UP AND FOUND LEGOLAS BESIDE ARAGORN AND EOMER THE ELF WAS WHETTING HIS LONG KNIFE THERE WAS FOR A WHILE A LULL IN THE ASSAULT SINCE THE ATTEMPT TO BREAK IN THROUGH THE CULVERT HAD BEEN FOILED
TWENTYONE SAID GIMLI
GOOD SAID LEGOLAS BUT MY COUNT IS NOW TWO DOZEN IT HAS BEEN KNIFEWORK UP HERE
EOMER AND ARAGORN LEANT WEARILY ON THEIR SWORDS AWAY ON THE LEFT THE CRASH AND CLAMOUR OF THE BATTLE ON THE ROCK ROSE LOUD AGAIN BUT THE HORNBURG STILL HELD FAST LIKE AN ISLAND IN THE SEA ITS GATES LAY IN RUIN BUT OVER THE BARRICADE OF BEAMS AND STONES WITHIN NO ENEMY AS YET HAD PASSED
ARAGORN LOOKED AT THE PALE STARS AND AT THE MOON NOW SLOPING BEHIND THE WESTERN HILLS THAT ENCLOSED THE VALLEY THIS IS A NIGHT AS LONG AS YEARS HE SAID HOW LONG WILL THE DAY TARRY
DAWN IS NOT FAR OFF SAID GAMLING WHO HAD NOW CLIMBED UP BESIDE HIM BUT DAWN WILL NOT HELP US I FEAR
YET DAWN IS EVER THE HOPE OF MEN SAID ARAGORN
BUT THESE CREATURES OF ISENGARD THESE HALFORCS AND GOBLINMEN THAT THE FOUL CRAFT OF SARUMAN HAS BRED THEY WILL NOT QUAIL AT THE SUN SAID GAMLING AND NEITHER WILL THE WILD MEN OF THE HILLS DO YOU NOT HEAR THEIR VOICES
I HEAR THEM SAID EOMER BUT THEY ARE ONLY THE SCREAM OF BIRDS AND THE BELLOWING OF BEASTS TO MY EARS
YET THERE ARE MANY THAT CRY IN THE DUNLAND TONGUE SAID GAMLING I KNOW THAT TONGUE IT IS AN ANCIENT SPEECH OF MEN AND ONCE WAS SPOKEN IN MANY WESTERN VALLEYS OF THE MARK HARK THEY HATE US AND THEY ARE GLAD FOR OUR DOOM SEEMS CERTAIN TO THEM THE KING THE KING THEY CRY WE WILL TAKE THEIR KING DEATH TO THE FORGOIL DEATH TO THE STRAWHEADS DEATH TO THE ROBBERS OF THE NORTH SUCH NAMES THEY HAVE FOR US NOT IN HALF A THOUSAND YEARS HAVE THEY FORGOTTEN THEIR GRIEVANCE THAT THE LORDS OF GONDOR GAVE THE MARK TO EORL THE YOUNG AND MADE ALLIANCE WITH HIM THAT OLD HATRED SARUMAN HAS INFLAMED THEY ARE FIERCE FOLK WHEN ROUSED THEY WILL NOT GIVE WAY NOW FOR DUSK OR DAWN UNTIL THEODEN IS TAKEN OR THEY THEMSELVES ARE SLAIN
NONETHELESS DAY WILL BRING HOPE TO ME SAID ARAGORN IS IT NOT SAID THAT NO FOE HAS EVER TAKEN THE HORNBURG IF MEN DEFENDED IT
SO THE MINSTRELS SAY SAID EOMER
THEN LET US DEFEND IT AND HOPE SAID ARAGORN
EVEN AS THEY SPOKE THERE CAME A BLARE OF TRUMPETS THEN THERE WAS A CRASH AND A FLASH OF FLAME AND SMOKE THE WATERS OF THE DEEPINGSTREAM POURED OUT HISSING AND FOAMING THEY WERE CHOKED NO LONGER A GAPING HOLE WAS BLASTED IN THE WALL A HOST OF DARK SHAPES POURED IN
DEVILRY OF SARUMAN CRIED ARAGORN THEY HAVE CREPT IN THE CULVERT AGAIN WHILE WE TALKED AND THEY HAVE LIT THE FIRE OF ORTHANC BENEATH OUR FEET ELENDIL ELENDIL HE SHOUTED AS HE LEAPED DOWN INTO THE BREACH BUT EVEN AS HE DID SO A HUNDRED LADDERS WERE RAISED AGAINST THE BATTLEMENTS OVER THE WALL AND UNDER THE WALL THE LAST ASSAULT CAME SWEEPING LIKE A DARK WAVE UPON A HILL OF SAND THE DEFENCE WAS SWEPT AWAY SOME OF THE RIDERS WERE DRIVEN BACK FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO THE DEEP FALLING AND FIGHTING AS THEY GAVE WAY STEP BY STEP TOWARDS THE CAVES OTHERS CUT THEIR WAY BACK TOWARDS THE CITADEL
A BROAD STAIRWAY CLIMBED FROM THE DEEP UP TO THE ROCK AND THE REARGATE OF THE HORNBURG NEAR THE BOTTOM STOOD ARAGORN IN HIS HAND STILL ANDURIL GLEAMED AND THE TERROR OF THE SWORD FOR A WHILE HELD BACK THE ENEMY AS ONE BY ONE ALL WHO COULD GAIN THE STAIR PASSED UP TOWARDS THE GATE BEHIND ON THE UPPER STEPS KNELT LEGOLAS HIS BOW WAS BENT BUT ONE GLEANED ARROW WAS ALL THAT HE HAD LEFT AND HE PEERED OUT NOW READY TO SHOOT THE FIRST ORC THAT SHOULD DARE TO APPROACH THE STAIR
ALL WHO CAN HAVE NOW GOT SAFE WITHIN ARAGORN HE CALLED COME BACK
ARAGORN TURNED AND SPED UP THE STAIR BUT AS HE RAN HE STUMBLED IN HIS WEARINESS AT ONCE HIS ENEMIES LEAPT FORWARD UP CAME THE ORCS YELLING WITH THEIR LONG ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO SEIZE HIM THE FOREMOST FELL WITH LEGOLAS LAST ARROW IN HIS THROAT BUT THE REST SPRANG OVER HIM THEN A GREAT BOULDER CAST FROM THE OUTER WALL ABOVE CRASHED DOWN UPON THE STAIR AND HURLED THEM BACK INTO THE DEEP ARAGORN GAINED THE DOOR AND SWIFTLY IT CLANGED TO BEHIND HIM
THINGS GO ILL MY FRIENDS HE SAID WIPING THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW WITH HIS ARM
ILL ENOUGH SAID LEGOLAS BUT NOT YET HOPELESS WHILE WE HAVE YOU WITH US WHERE IS GIMLI
I DO NOT KNOW SAID ARAGORN I LAST SAW HIM FIGHTING ON THE GROUND BEHIND THE WALL BUT THE ENEMY SWEPT US APART
ALAS THAT IS EVIL NEWS SAID LEGOLAS
HE IS STOUT AND STRONG SAID ARAGORN LET US HOPE THAT HE WILL ESCAPE BACK TO THE CAVES THERE HE WOULD BE SAFE FOR A WHILE SAFER THAN WE SUCH A REFUGE WOULD BE TO THE LIKING OF A DWARF
THAT MUST BE MY HOPE SAID LEGOLAS BUT I WISH THAT HE HAD COME THIS WAY I DESIRED TO TELL MASTER GIMLI THAT MY TALE IS NOW THIRTYNINE
IF HE WINS BACK TO THE CAVES HE WILL PASS YOUR COUNT AGAIN LAUGHED ARAGORN NEVER DID I SEE AN AXE SO WIELDED
I MUST GO AND SEEK SOME ARROWS SAID LEGOLAS WOULD THAT THIS NIGHT WOULD END AND I COULD HAVE BETTER LIGHT FOR SHOOTING
ARAGORN NOW PASSED INTO THE CITADEL THERE TO HIS DISMAY HE LEARNED THAT EOMER HAD NOT REACHED THE HORNBURG
NAY HE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK SAID ONE OF THE WESTFOLDMEN I LAST SAW HIM GATHERING MEN ABOUT HIM AND FIGHTING IN THE MOUTH OF THE DEEP GAMLING WAS WITH HIM AND THE DWARF BUT I COULD NOT COME TO THEM
ARAGORN STRODE ON THROUGH THE INNER COURT AND MOUNTED TO A HIGH CHAMBER IN THE TOWER THERE STOOD THE KING DARK AGAINST A NARROW WINDOW LOOKING OUT UPON THE VALE
WHAT IS THE NEWS ARAGORN HE SAID
THE DEEPING WALL IS TAKEN LORD AND ALL THE DEFENCE SWEPT AWAY BUT MANY HAVE ESCAPED HITHER TO THE ROCK
IS EOMER HERE
NO LORD BUT MANY OF YOUR MEN RETREATED INTO THE DEEP AND SOME SAY THAT EOMER WAS AMONGST THEM IN THE NARROWS THEY MAY HOLD BACK THE ENEMY AND COME WITHIN THE CAVES WHAT HOPE THEY MAY HAVE THEN I DO NOT KNOW
MORE THAN WE GOOD PROVISION IT IS SAID AND THE AIR IS WHOLESOME THERE BECAUSE OF THE OUTLETS THROUGH FISSURES IN THE ROCK FAR ABOVE NONE CAN FORCE AN ENTRANCE AGAINST DETERMINED MEN THEY MAY HOLD OUT LONG
BUT THE ORCS HAVE BROUGHT A DEVILRY FROM ORTHANC SAID ARAGORN THEY HAVE A BLASTING FIRE AND WITH IT THEY TOOK THE WALL IF THEY CANNOT COME IN THE CAVES THEY MAY SEAL UP THOSE THAT ARE INSIDE BUT NOW WE MUST TURN ALL OUR THOUGHTS TO OUR OWN DEFENCE
I FRET IN THIS PRISON SAID THEODEN IF I COULD HAVE SET A SPEAR IN REST RIDING BEFORE MY MEN UPON THE FIELD MAYBE I COULD HAVE FELT AGAIN THE JOY OF BATTLE AND SO ENDED BUT I SERVE LITTLE PURPOSE HERE
HERE AT LEAST YOU ARE GUARDED IN THE STRONGEST FASTNESS OF THE MARK SAID ARAGORN MORE HOPE WE HAVE TO DEFEND YOU IN THE HORNBURG THAN IN EDORAS OR EVEN AT DUNHARROW IN THE MOUNTAINS
IT IS SAID THAT THE HORNBURG HAS NEVER FALLEN TO ASSAULT SAID THEODEN BUT NOW MY HEART IS DOUBTFUL THE WORLD CHANGES AND ALL THAT ONCE WAS STRONG NOW PROVES UNSURE HOW SHALL ANY TOWER WITHSTAND SUCH NUMBERS AND SUCH RECKLESS HATE HAD I KNOWN THAT THE STRENGTH OF ISENGARD WAS GROWN SO GREAT MAYBE L SHOULD NOT SO RASHLY HAVE RIDDEN FORTH TO MEET IT FOR ALL THE ARTS OF GANDALF HIS COUNSEL SEEMS NOT NOW SO GOOD AS IT DID UNDER THE MORNING SUN
DO NOT JUDGE THE COUNSEL OF GANDALF UNTIL ALL IS OVER LORD SAID ARAGORN
THE END WILL NOT BE LONG SAID THE KING BUT I WILL NOT END HERE TAKEN LIKE AN OLD BADGER IN A TRAP SNOWMANE AND HASUFEL AND THE HORSES OF MY GUARD ARE IN THE INNER COURT WHEN DAWN COMES I WILL BID MEN SOUND HELMS HORN AND I WILL RIDE FORTH WILL YOU RIDE WITH ME THEN SON OF ARATHORN MAYBE WE SHALL CLEAVE A ROAD OR MAKE SUCH AN END AS WILL BE WORTH A SONG  IF ANY BE LEFT TO SING OF US HEREAFTER
I WILL RIDE WITH YOU SAID ARAGORN
TAKING HIS LEAVE HE RETURNED TO THE WALLS AND PASSED ROUND ALL THEIR CIRCUIT ENHEARTENING THE MEN AND LENDING AID WHEREVER THE ASSAULT WAS HOT LEGOLAS WENT WITH HIM BLASTS OF FIRE LEAPED UP FROM BELOW SHAKING THE STONES GRAPPLINGHOOKS WERE HURLED AND LADDERS RAISED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE ORCS GAINED THE SUMMIT OF THE OUTER WALL AND AGAIN THE DEFENDERS CAST THEM DOWN
AT LAST ARAGORN STOOD ABOVE THE GREAT GATES HEEDLESS OF THE DARTS OF THE ENEMY AS HE LOOKED FORTH HE SAW THE EASTERN SKY GROW PALE THEN HE RAISED HIS EMPTY HAND PALM OUTWARD IN TOKEN OF PARLEY
THE ORCS YELLED AND JEERED COME DOWN COME DOWN THEY CRIED IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO US COME DOWN BRING OUT YOUR KING WE ARE THE FIGHTING URUKHAI WE WILL FETCH HIM FROM HIS HOLE IF HE DOES NOT COME BRING OUT YOUR SKULKING KING
THE KING STAYS OR COMES AT HIS OWN WILL SAID ARAGORN
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THEY ANSWERED WHY DO YOU LOOK OUT DO YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREATNESS OF OUR ARMY WE ARE THE FIGHTING URUKHAI
I LOOKED OUT TO SEE THE DAWN SAID ARAGORN
WHAT OF THE DAWN THEY JEERED WE ARE THE URUKHAI WE DO NOT STOP THE FIGHT FOR NIGHT OR DAY FOR FAIR WEATHER OR FOR STORM WE COME TO KILL BY SUN OR MOON WHAT OF THE DAWN
NONE KNOWS WHAT THE NEW DAY SHALL BRING HIM SAID ARAGORN GET YOU GONE ERE IT TURN TO YOUR EVIL
GET DOWN OR WE WILL SHOOT YOU FROM THE WALL THEY CRIED THIS IS NO PARLEY YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
I HAVE STILL THIS TO SAY ANSWERED ARAGORN NO ENEMY HAS YET TAKEN THE HORNBURG DEPART OR NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE SPARED NOT ONE WILL BE LEFT ALIVE TO TAKE BACK TIDINGS TO THE NORTH YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR PERIL
SO GREAT A POWER AND ROYALTY WAS REVEALED IN ARAGORN AS HE STOOD THERE ALONE ABOVE THE RUINED GATES BEFORE THE HOST OF HIS ENEMIES THAT MANY OF THE WILD MEN PAUSED AND LOOKED BACK OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO THE VALLEY AND SOME LOOKED UP DOUBTFULLY AT THE SKY BUT THE ORCS LAUGHED WITH LOUD VOICES AND A HAIL OF DARTS AND ARROWS WHISTLED OVER THE WALL AS ARAGORN LEAPED DOWN
THERE WAS A ROAR AND A BLAST OF FIRE THE ARCHWAY OF THE GATE ABOVE WHICH HE HAD STOOD A MOMENT BEFORE CRUMBLED AND CRASHED IN SMOKE AND DUST THE BARRICADE WAS SCATTERED AS IF BY A THUNDERBOLT ARAGORN RAN TO THE KINGS TOWER
BUT EVEN AS THE GATE FELL AND THE ORCS ABOUT IT YELLED PREPARING TO CHARGE A MURMUR AROSE BEHIND THEM LIKE A WIND IN THE DISTANCE AND IT GREW TO A CLAMOUR OF MANY VOICES CRYING STRANGE NEWS IN THE DAWN THE ORCS UPON THE ROCK HEARING THE RUMOUR OF DISMAY WAVERED AND LOOKED BACK AND THEN SUDDEN AND TERRIBLE FROM THE TOWER ABOVE THE SOUND OF THE GREAT HORN OF HELM RANG OUT
ALL THAT HEARD THAT SOUND TREMBLED MANY OF THE ORCS CAST THEMSELVES ON THEIR FACES AND COVERED THEIR EARS WITH THEIR CLAWS BACK FROM THE DEEP THE ECHOES CAME BLAST UPON BLAST AS IF ON EVERY CLIFF AND HILL A MIGHTY HERALD STOOD BUT ON THE WALLS MEN LOOKED UP LISTENING WITH WONDER FOR THE ECHOES DID NOT DIE EVER THE HORNBLASTS WOUND ON AMONG THE HILLS NEARER NOW AND LOUDER THEY ANSWERED ONE TO ANOTHER BLOWING FIERCE AND FREE
HELM HELM THE RIDERS SHOUTED HELM IS ARISEN AND COMES BACK TO WAR HELM FOR THEODEN KING
AND WITH THAT SHOUT THE KING CAME HIS HORSE WAS WHITE AS SNOW GOLDEN WAS HIS SHIELD AND HIS SPEAR WAS LONG AT HIS RIGHT HAND WAS ARAGORN ELENDILS HEIR BEHIND HIM RODE THE LORDS OF THE HOUSE OF EORL THE YOUNG LIGHT SPRANG IN THE SKY NIGHT DEPARTED
FORTH EORLINGAS WITH A CRY AND A GREAT NOISE THEY CHARGED DOWN FROM THE GATES THEY ROARED OVER THE CAUSEWAY THEY SWEPT AND THEY DROVE THROUGH THE HOSTS OF ISENGARD AS A WIND AMONG GRASS BEHIND THEM FROM THE DEEP CAME THE STERN CRIES OF MEN ISSUING FROM THE CAVES DRIVING FORTH THE ENEMY OUT POURED ALL THE MEN THAT WERE LEFT UPON THE ROCK AND EVER THE SOUND OF BLOWING HORNS ECHOED IN THE HILLS
ON THEY RODE THE KING AND HIS COMPANIONS CAPTAINS AND CHAMPIONS FELL OR FLED BEFORE THEM NEITHER ORC NOR MAN WITHSTOOD THEM THEIR BACKS WERE TO THE SWORDS AND SPEARS OF THE RIDERS AND THEIR FACES TO THE VALLEY THEY CRIED AND WAILED FOR FEAR AND GREAT WONDER HAD COME UPON THEM WITH THE RISING OF THE DAY
SO KING THEODEN RODE FROM HELMS GATE AND CLOVE HIS PATH TO THE GREAT DIKE THERE THE COMPANY HALTED LIGHT GREW BRIGHT ABOUT THEM SHAFTS OF THE SUN FLARED ABOVE THE EASTERN HILLS AND GLIMMERED ON THEIR SPEARS BUT THEY SAT SILENT ON THEIR HORSES AND THEY GAZED DOWN UPON THE DEEPINGCOOMB
THE LAND HAD CHANGED WHERE BEFORE THE GREEN DALE HAD LAIN ITS GRASSY SLOPES LAPPING THE EVERMOUNTING HILLS THERE NOW A FOREST LOOMED GREAT TREES BARE AND SILENT STOOD RANK ON RANK WITH TANGLED BOUGH AND HOARY HEAD THEIR TWISTED ROOTS WERE BURIED IN THE LONG GREEN GRASS DARKNESS WAS UNDER THEM BETWEEN THE DIKE AND THE EAVES OF THAT NAMELESS WOOD ONLY TWO OPEN FURLONGS LAY THERE NOW COWERED THE PROUD HOSTS OF SARUMAN IN TERROR OF THE KING AND IN TERROR OF THE TREES THEY STREAMED DOWN FROM HELMS GATE UNTIL ALL ABOVE THE DIKE WAS EMPTY OF THEM BUT BELOW IT THEY WERE PACKED LIKE SWARMING FLIES VAINLY THEY CRAWLED AND CLAMBERED ABOUT THE WALLS OF THE COOMB SEEKING TO ESCAPE UPON THE EAST TOO SHEER AND STONY WAS THE VALLEYS SIDE UPON THE LEFT FROM THE WEST THEIR FINAL DOOM APPROACHED
THERE SUDDENLY UPON A RIDGE APPEARED A RIDER CLAD IN WHITE SHINING IN THE RISING SUN OVER THE LOW HILLS THE HORNS WERE SOUNDING BEHIND HIM HASTENING DOWN THE LONG SLOPES WERE A THOUSAND MEN ON FOOT THEIR SWORDS WERE IN THEIR HANDS AMID THEM STRODE A MAN TALL AND STRONG HIS SHIELD WAS RED AS HE CAME TO THE VALLEYS BRINK HE SET TO HIS LIPS A GREAT BLACK HORN AND BLEW A RINGING BLAST
ERKENBRAND THE RIDERS SHOUTED ERKENBRAND
BEHOLD THE WHITE RIDER CRIED ARAGORN GANDALF IS COME AGAIN
MITHRANDIR MITHRANDIR SAID LEGOLAS THIS IS WIZARDRY INDEED COME I WOULD LOOK ON THIS FOREST ERE THE SPELL CHANGES
THE HOSTS OF ISENGARD ROARED SWAYING THIS WAY AND THAT TURNING FROM FEAR TO FEAR AGAIN THE HORN SOUNDED FROM THE TOWER DOWN THROUGH THE BREACH OF THE DIKE CHARGED THE KINGS COMPANY DOWN FROM THE HILLS LEAPED ERKENBRAND LORD OF WESTFOLD DOWN LEAPED SHADOWFAX LIKE A DEER THAT RUNS SUREFOOTED IN THE MOUNTAINS THE WHITE RIDER WAS UPON THEM AND THE TERROR OF HIS COMING FILLED THE ENEMY WITH MADNESS THE WILD MEN FELL ON THEIR FACES BEFORE HIM THE ORCS REELED AND SCREAMED AND CAST ASIDE BOTH SWORD AND SPEAR LIKE A BLACK SMOKE DRIVEN BY A MOUNTING WIND THEY FLED WAILING THEY PASSED UNDER THE WAITING SHADOW OF THE TREES AND FROM THAT SHADOW NONE EVER CAME AGAIN



CHAPTER 8
THE ROAD TO ISENGARD

SO IT WAS THAT IN THE LIGHT OF A FAIR MORNING KING THEODEN AND GANDALF THE WHITE RIDER MET AGAIN UPON THE GREEN GRASS BESIDE THE DEEPINGSTREAM THERE WAS ALSO ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN AND LEGOLAS THE ELF AND ERKENBRAND OF WESTFOLD AND THE LORDS OF THE GOLDEN HOUSE ABOUT THEM WERE GATHERED THE ROHIRRIM THE RIDERS OF THE MARK WONDER OVERCAME THEIR JOY IN VICTORY AND THEIR EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS THE WOOD
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT SHOUT AND DOWN FROM THE DIKE CAME THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DRIVEN BACK INTO THE DEEP THERE CAME GAMLING THE OLD AND EOMER SON OF EOMUND AND BESIDE THEM WALKED GIMLI THE DWARF HE HAD NO HELM AND ABOUT HIS HEAD WAS A LINEN BAND STAINED WITH BLOOD BUT HIS VOICE WAS LOUD AND STRONG
FORTYTWO MASTER LEGOLAS HE CRIED ALAS MY AXE IS NOTCHED THE FORTYSECOND HAD AN IRON COLLAR ON HIS NECK HOW IS IT WITH YOU
YOU HAVE PASSED MY SCORE BY ONE ANSWERED LEGOLAS BUT I DO NOT GRUDGE YOU THE GAME SO GLAD AM I TO SEE YOU ON YOUR LEGS
WELCOME EOMER SISTERSON SAID THEODEN NOW THAT I SEE YOU SAFE I AM GLAD INDEED
HAIL LORD OF THE MARK SAID EOMER THE DARK NIGHT HAS PASSED AND DAY HAS COME AGAIN BUT THE DAY HAS BROUGHT STRANGE TIDINGS HE TURNED AND GAZED IN WONDER FIRST AT THE WOOD AND THEN AT GANDALF ONCE MORE YOU COME IN THE HOUR OF NEED UNLOOKEDFOR HE SAID
UNLOOKEDFOR SAID GANDALF I SAID THAT I WOULD RETURN AND MEET YOU HERE
BUT YOU DID NOT NAME THE HOUR NOR FORETELL THE MANNER OF YOUR COMING STRANGE HELP YOU BRING YOU ARE MIGHTY IN WIZARDRY GANDALF THE WHITE
THAT MAY BE BUT IF SO I HAVE NOT SHOWN IT YET I HAVE BUT GIVEN GOOD COUNSEL IN PERIL AND MADE USE OF THE SPEED OF SHADOWFAX YOUR OWN VALOUR HAS DONE MORE AND THE STOUT LEGS OF THE WESTFOLDMEN MARCHING THROUGH THE NIGHT
THEN THEY ALL GAZED AT GANDALF WITH STILL GREATER WONDER SOME GLANCED DARKLY AT THE WOOD AND PASSED THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR BROWS AS IF THEY THOUGHT THEIR EYES SAW OTHERWISE THAN HIS
GANDALF LAUGHED LONG AND MERRILY THE TREES HE SAID NAY I SEE THE WOOD AS PLAINLY AS DO YOU BUT THAT IS NO DEED OF MINE IT IS A THING BEYOND THE COUNSEL OF THE WISE BETTER THAN MY DESIGN AND BETTER EVEN THAN MY HOPE THE EVENT HAS PROVED
THEN IF NOT YOURS WHOSE IS THE WIZARDRY SAID THEODEN NOT SARUMANS THAT IS PLAIN IS THERE SOME MIGHTIER SAGE OF WHOM WE HAVE YET TO LEARN
IT IS NOT WIZARDRY BUT A POWER FAR OLDER SAID GANDALF A POWER THAT WALKED THE EARTH ERE ELF SANG OR HAMMER RANG
ERE IRON WAS FOUND OR TREE WAS HEWN
WHEN YOUNG WAS MOUNTAIN UNDER MOON
ERE RING WAS MADE OR WROUGHT WAS WOE
IT WALKED THE FORESTS LONG AGO

AND WHAT MAY BE THE ANSWER TO YOUR RIDDLE SAID THEODEN
IF YOU WOULD LEARN THAT YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME TO ISENGARD ANSWERED GANDALF
TO ISENGARD THEY CRIED
YES SAID GANDALF I SHALL RETURN TO ISENGARD AND THOSE WHO WILL MAY COME WITH ME THERE WE MAY SEE STRANGE THINGS
BUT THERE ARE NOT MEN ENOUGH IN THE MARK NOT IF THEY WERE ALL GATHERED TOGETHER AND HEALED OF WOUNDS AND WEARINESS TO ASSAULT THE STRONGHOLD OF SARUMAN SAID THEODEN
NEVERTHELESS TO ISENGARD I GO SAID GANDALF I SHALL NOT STAY THERE LONG MY WAY LIES NOW EASTWARD LOOK FOR ME IN EDORAS ERE THE WANING OF THE MOON
NAY SAID THEODEN IN THE DARK HOUR BEFORE DAWN I DOUBTED BUT WE WILL NOT PART NOW I WILL COME WITH YOU IF THAT IS YOUR COUNSEL
I WISH TO SPEAK WITH SARUMAN AS SOON AS MAY BE NOW SAID GANDALF AND SINCE HE HAS DONE YOU GREAT INJURY IT WOULD BE FITTING IF YOU WERE THERE BUT HOW SOON AND HOW SWIFTLY WILL YOU RIDE
MY MEN ARE WEARY WITH BATTLE SAID THE KING AND I AM WEARY ALSO FOR I HAVE RIDDEN FAR AND SLEPT LITTLE ALAS MY OLD AGE IS NOT FEIGNED NOR DUE ONLY TO THE WHISPERINGS OF WORMTONGUE IT IS AN ILL THAT NO LEECH CAN WHOLLY CURE NOT EVEN GANDALF
THEN LET ALL WHO ARE TO RIDE WITH ME REST NOW SAID GANDALF WE WILL JOURNEY UNDER THE SHADOW OF EVENING IT IS AS WELL FOR IT IS MY COUNSEL THAT ALL OUR COMINGS AND GOINGS SHOULD BE AS SECRET AS MAY BE HENCEFORTH BUT DO NOT COMMAND MANY MEN TO GO WITH YOU THEODEN WE GO TO A PARLEY NOT TO A FIGHT
THE KING THEN CHOSE MEN THAT WERE UNHURT AND HAD SWIFT HORSES AND HE SENT THEM FORTH WITH TIDINGS OF THE VICTORY INTO EVERY VALE OF THE MARK AND THEY BORE HIS SUMMONS ALSO BIDDING ALL MEN YOUNG AND OLD TO COME IN HASTE TO EDORAS THERE THE LORD OF THE MARK WOULD HOLD AN ASSEMBLY OF ALL THAT COULD BEAR ARMS ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE FULL MOON TO RIDE WITH HIM TO ISENGARD THE KING CHOSE EOMER AND TWENTY MEN OF HIS HOUSEHOLD WITH GANDALF WOULD GO ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS AND GIMLI IN SPITE OF HIS HURT THE DWARF WOULD NOT STAY BEHIND
IT WAS ONLY A FEEBLE BLOW AND THE CAP TURNED IT HE SAID IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN SUCH AN ORCSCRATCH TO KEEP ME BACK
I WILL TEND IT WHILE YOU REST SAID ARAGORN
THE KING NOW RETURNED TO THE HORNBURG AND SLEPT SUCH A SLEEP OF QUIET AS HE HAD NOT KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AND THE REMAINDER OF HIS CHOSEN COMPANY RESTED ALSO BUT THE OTHERS ALL THAT WERE NOT HURT OR WOUNDED BEGAN A GREAT LABOUR FOR MANY HAD FALLEN IN THE BATTLE AND LAY DEAD UPON THE FIELD OR IN THE DEEP
NO ORCS REMAINED ALIVE THEIR BODIES WERE UNCOUNTED BUT A GREAT MANY OF THE HILLMEN HAD GIVEN THEMSELVES UP AND THEY WERE AFRAID AND CRIED FOR MERCY
THE MEN OF THE MARK TOOK THEIR WEAPONS FROM THEM AND SET THEM TO WORK
HELP NOW TO REPAIR THE EVIL IN WHICH YOU HAVE JOINED SAID ERKENBRAND AND AFTERWARDS YOU SHALL TAKE AN OATH NEVER AGAIN TO PASS THE FORDS OF ISEN IN ARMS NOR TO MARCH WITH THE ENEMIES OF MEN AND THEN YOU SHALL GO FREE BACK TO YOUR LAND FOR YOU HAVE BEEN DELUDED BY SARUMAN MANY OF YOU HAVE GOT DEATH AS THE REWARD OF YOUR TRUST IN HIM BUT HAD YOU CONQUERED LITTLE BETTER WOULD YOUR WAGES HAVE BEEN
THE MEN OF DUNLAND WERE AMAZED FOR SARUMAN HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE MEN OF ROHAN WERE CRUEL AND BURNED THEIR CAPTIVES ALIVE
IN THE MIDST OF THE FIELD BEFORE THE HORNBURG TWO MOUNDS WERE RAISED AND BENEATH THEM WERE LAID ALL THE RIDERS OF THE MARK WHO FELL IN THE DEFENCE THOSE OF THE EAST DALES UPON ONE SIDE AND THOSE OF WESTFOLD UPON THE OTHER IN A GRAVE ALONE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HORNBURG LAY HAMA CAPTAIN OF THE KINGS GUARD HE FELL BEFORE THE GATE
THE ORCS WERE PILED IN GREAT HEAPS AWAY FROM THE MOUNDS OF MEN NOT FAR FROM THE EAVES OF THE FOREST AND THE PEOPLE WERE TROUBLED IN THEIR MINDS FOR THE HEAPS OF CARRION WERE TOO GREAT FOR BURIAL OR FOR BURNING THEY HAD LITTLE WOOD FOR FIRING AND NONE WOULD HAVE DARED TO TAKE AN AXE TO THE STRANGE TREES EVEN IF GANDALF HAD NOT WARNED THEM TO HURT NEITHER BARK NOR BOUGH AT THEIR GREAT PERIL
LET THE ORCS LIE SAID GANDALF THE MORNING MAY BRING NEW COUNSEL
IN THE AFTERNOON THE KINGS COMPANY PREPARED TO DEPART THE WORK OF BURIAL WAS THEN BUT BEGINNING AND THEODEN MOURNED FOR THE LOSS OF HAMA HIS CAPTAIN AND CAST THE FIRST EARTH UPON HIS GRAVE GREAT INJURY INDEED HAS SARUMAN DONE TO ME AND ALL THIS LAND HE SAID AND I WILL REMEMBER IT WHEN WE MEET
THE SUN WAS ALREADY DRAWING NEAR THE HILLS UPON THE WEST OF THE COOMB WHEN AT LAST THEODEN AND GANDALF AND THEIR COMPANIONS RODE DOWN FROM THE DIKE BEHIND THEM WERE GATHERED A GREAT HOST BOTH OF THE RIDERS AND OF THE PEOPLE OF WESTFOLD OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAD COME OUT FROM THE CAVES A SONG OF VICTORY THEY SANG WITH CLEAR VOICES AND THEN THEY FELL SILENT WONDERING WHAT WOULD CHANCE FOR THEIR EYES WERE ON THE TREES AND THEY FEARED THEM
THE RIDERS CAME TO THE WOOD AND THEY HALTED HORSE AND MAN THEY WERE UNWILLING TO PASS IN THE TREES WERE GREY AND MENACING AND A SHADOW OR A MIST WAS ABOUT THEM THE ENDS OF THEIR LONG SWEEPING BOUGHS HUNG DOWN LIKE SEARCHING FINGERS THEIR ROOTS STOOD UP FROM THE GROUND LIKE THE LIMBS OF STRANGE MONSTERS AND DARK CAVERNS OPENED BENEATH THEM BUT GANDALF WENT FORWARD LEADING THE COMPANY AND WHERE THE ROAD FROM THE HORNBURG MET THE TREES THEY SAW NOW AN OPENING LIKE AN ARCHED GATE UNDER MIGHTY BOUGHS AND THROUGH IT GANDALF PASSED AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM THEN TO THEIR AMAZEMENT THEY FOUND THAT THE ROAD RAN ON AND THE DEEPINGSTREAM BESIDE IT AND THE SKY WAS OPEN ABOVE AND FULL OF GOLDEN LIGHT BUT ON EITHER SIDE THE GREAT AISLES OF THE WOOD WERE ALREADY WRAPPED IN DUSK STRETCHING AWAY INTO IMPENETRABLE SHADOWS AND THERE THEY HEARD THE CREAKING AND GROANING OF BOUGHS AND FAR CRIES AND A RUMOUR OF WORDLESS VOICES MURMURING ANGRILY NO ORC OR OTHER LIVING CREATURE COULD BE SEEN
LEGOLAS AND GIMLI WERE NOW RIDING TOGETHER UPON ONE HORSE AND THEY KEPT CLOSE BESIDE GANDALF FOR GIMLI WAS AFRAID OF THE WOOD
IT IS HOT IN HERE SAID LEGOLAS TO GANDALF I FEEL A GREAT WRATH ABOUT ME DO YOU NOT FEEL THE AIR THROB IN YOUR EARS
YES SAID GANDALF
WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE MISERABLE ORCS SAID LEGOLAS
THAT I THINK NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW SAID GANDALF
THEY RODE IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE BUT LEGOLAS WAS EVER GLANCING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND WOULD OFTEN HAVE HALTED TO LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF THE WOOD IF GIMLI HAD ALLOWED IT
THESE ARE THE STRANGEST TREES THAT EVER I SAW HE SAID AND I HAVE SEEN MANY AN OAK GROW FROM ACORN TO RUINOUS AGE I WISH THAT THERE WERE LEISURE NOW TO WALK AMONG THEM THEY HAVE VOICES AND IN TIME I MIGHT COME TO UNDERSTAND THEIR THOUGHT
NO NO SAID GIMLI LET US LEAVE THEM I GUESS THEIR THOUGHT ALREADY HATRED OF ALL THAT GO ON TWO LEGS AND THEIR SPEECH IS OF CRUSHING AND STRANGLING
NOT OF ALL THAT GO ON TWO LEGS SAID LEGOLAS THERE I THINK YOU ARE WRONG IT IS ORCS THAT THEY HATE FOR THEY DO NOT BELONG HERE AND KNOW LITTLE OF ELVES AND MEN FAR AWAY ARE THE VALLEYS WHERE THEY SPRANG FROM THE DEEP DALES OF FANGORN GIMLI THAT IS WHENCE THEY COME I GUESS
THEN THAT IS THE MOST PERILOUS WOOD IN MIDDLEEARTH SAID GIMLI I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THE PART THEY HAVE PLAYED BUT I DO NOT LOVE THEM YOU MAY THINK THEM WONDERFUL BUT I HAVE SEEN A GREATER WONDER IN THIS LAND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY GROVE OR GLADE THAT EVER GREW MY HEART IS STILL FULL OF IT
STRANGE ARE THE WAYS OF MEN LEGOLAS HERE THEY HAVE ONE OF THE MARVELS OF THE NORTHERN WORLD AND WHAT DO THEY SAY OF IT CAVES THEY SAY CAVES HOLES TO FLY TO IN TIME OF WAR TO STORE FODDER IN MY GOOD LEGOLAS DO YOU KNOW THAT THE CAVERNS OF HELMS DEEP ARE VAST AND BEAUTIFUL THERE WOULD BE AN ENDLESS PILGRIMAGE OF DWARVES MERELY TO GAZE AT THEM IF SUCH THINGS WERE KNOWN TO BE AYE INDEED THEY WOULD PAY PURE GOLD FOR A BRIEF GLANCE
AND I WOULD GIVE GOLD TO BE EXCUSED SAID LEGOLAS AND DOUBLE TO BE LET OUT IF I STRAYED IN
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SO I FORGIVE YOUR JEST SAID GIMLI BUT YOU SPEAK LIKE A FOOL DO YOU THINK THOSE HALLS ARE FAIR WHERE YOUR KING DWELLS UNDER THE HILL IN MIRKWOOD AND DWARVES HELPED IN THEIR MAKING LONG AGO THEY ARE BUT HOVELS COMPARED WITH THE CAVERNS I HAVE SEEN HERE IMMEASURABLE HALLS FILLED WITH AN EVERLASTING MUSIC OF WATER THAT TINKLES INTO POOLS AS FAIR AS KHELEDZARAM IN THE STARLIGHT
AND LEGOLAS WHEN THE TORCHES ARE KINDLED AND MEN WALK ON THE SANDY FLOORS UNDER THE ECHOING DOMES AH THEN LEGOLAS GEMS AND CRYSTALS AND VEINS OF PRECIOUS ORE GLINT IN THE POLISHED WALLS AND THE LIGHT GLOWS THROUGH FOLDED MARBLES SHELLLIKE TRANSLUCENT AS THE LIVING HANDS OF QUEEN GALADRIEL THERE ARE COLUMNS OF WHITE AND SAFFRON AND DAWNROSE LEGOLAS FLUTED AND TWISTED INTO DREAMLIKE FORMS THEY SPRING UP FROM MANYCOLOURED FLOORS TO MEET THE GLISTENING PENDANTS OF THE ROOF WINGS ROPES CURTAINS FINE AS FROZEN CLOUDS SPEARS BANNERS PINNACLES OF SUSPENDED PALACES STILL LAKES MIRROR THEM A GLIMMERING WORLD LOOKS UP FROM DARK POOLS COVERED WITH CLEAR GLASS CITIES SUCH AS THE MIND OF DURIN COULD SCARCE HAVE IMAGINED IN HIS SLEEP STRETCH ON THROUGH AVENUES AND PILLARED COURTS ON INTO THE DARK RECESSES WHERE NO LIGHT CAN COME AND PLINK A SILVER DROP FALLS AND THE ROUND WRINKLES IN THE GLASS MAKE ALL THE TOWERS BEND AND WAVER LIKE WEEDS AND CORALS IN A GROTTO OF THE SEA THEN EVENING COMES THEY FADE AND TWINKLE OUT THE TORCHES PASS ON INTO ANOTHER CHAMBER AND ANOTHER DREAM THERE IS CHAMBER AFTER CHAMBER LEGOLAS HALL OPENING OUT OF HALL DOME AFTER DOME STAIR BEYOND STAIR AND STILL THE WINDING PATHS LEAD ON INTO THE MOUNTAINS HEART CAVES THE CAVERNS OF HELMS DEEP HAPPY WAS THE CHANCE THAT DROVE ME THERE IT MAKES ME WEEP TO LEAVE THEM
THEN I WILL WISH YOU THIS FORTUNE FOR YOUR COMFORT GIMLI SAID THE ELF THAT YOU MAY COME SAFE FROM WAR AND RETURN TO SEE THEM AGAIN BUT DO NOT TELL ALL YOUR KINDRED THERE SEEMS LITTLE LEFT FOR THEM TO DO FROM YOUR ACCOUNT MAYBE THE MEN OF THIS LAND ARE WISE TO SAY LITTLE ONE FAMILY OF BUSY DWARVES WITH HAMMER AND CHISEL MIGHT MAR MORE THAN THEY MADE
NO YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND SAID GIMLI NO DWARF COULD BE UNMOVED BY SUCH LOVELINESS NONE OF DURINS RACE WOULD MINE THOSE CAVES FOR STONES OR ORE NOT IF DIAMONDS AND GOLD COULD BE GOT THERE DO YOU CUT DOWN GROVES OF BLOSSOMING TREES IN THE SPRINGTIME FOR FIREWOOD WE WOULD TEND THESE GLADES OF FLOWERING STONE NOT QUARRY THEM WITH CAUTIOUS SKILL TAP BY TAP  A SMALL CHIP OF ROCK AND NO MORE PERHAPS IN A WHOLE ANXIOUS DAY  SO WE COULD WORK AND AS THE YEARS WENT BY WE SHOULD OPEN UP NEW WAYS AND DISPLAY FAR CHAMBERS THAT ARE STILL DARK GLIMPSED ONLY AS A VOID BEYOND FISSURES IN THE ROCK AND LIGHTS LEGOLAS WE SHOULD MAKE LIGHTS SUCH LAMPS AS ONCE SHONE IN KHAZADDUM AND WHEN WE WISHED WE WOULD DRIVE AWAY THE NIGHT THAT HAS LAIN THERE SINCE THE HILLS WERE MADE AND WHEN WE DESIRED REST WE WOULD LET THE NIGHT RETURN
YOU MOVE ME GIMLI SAID LEGOLAS I HAVE NEVER HEARD YOU SPEAK LIKE THIS BEFORE ALMOST YOU MAKE ME REGRET THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN THESE CAVES COME LET US MAKE THIS BARGAIN  IF WE BOTH RETURN SAFE OUT OF THE PERILS THAT AWAIT US WE WILL JOURNEY FOR A WHILE TOGETHER YOU SHALL VISIT FANGORN WITH ME AND THEN I WILL COME WITH YOU TO SEE HELMS DEEP
THAT WOULD NOT BE THE WAY OF RETURN THAT I SHOULD CHOOSE SAID GIMLI BUT I WILL ENDURE FANGORN IF I HAVE YOUR PROMISE TO COME BACK TO THE CAVES AND SHARE THEIR WONDER WITH ME
YOU HAVE MY PROMISE SAID LEGOLAS BUT ALAS NOW WE MUST LEAVE BEHIND BOTH CAVE AND WOOD FOR A WHILE SEE WE ARE COMING TO THE END OF THE TREES HOW FAR IS IT TO ISENGARD GANDALF
ABOUT FIFTEEN LEAGUES AS THE CROWS OF SARUMAN MAKE IT SAID GANDALF FIVE FROM THE MOUTH OF DEEPINGCOOMB TO THE FORDS AND TEN MORE FROM THERE TO THE GATES OF ISENGARD BUT WE SHALL NOT RIDE ALL THE WAY THIS NIGHT
AND WHEN WE COME THERE WHAT SHALL WE SEE ASKED GIMLI YOU MAY KNOW BUT I CANNOT GUESS
I DO NOT KNOW MYSELF FOR CERTAIN ANSWERED THE WIZARD I WAS THERE AT NIGHTFALL YESTERDAY BUT MUCH MAY HAVE HAPPENED SINCE YET I THINK THAT YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT THE JOURNEY WAS IN VAIN  NOT THOUGH THE GLITTERING CAVES OF AGLAROND BE LEFT BEHIND
AT LAST THE COMPANY PASSED THROUGH THE TREES AND FOUND THAT THEY HAD COME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE COOMB WHERE THE ROAD FROM HELMS DEEP BRANCHED GOING ONE WAY EAST TO EDORAS AND THE OTHER NORTH TO THE FORDS OF ISEN AS THEY RODE FROM UNDER THE EAVES OF THE WOOD LEGOLAS HALTED AND LOOKED BACK WITH REGRET THEN HE GAVE A SUDDEN CRY
THERE ARE EYES HE SAID EYES LOOKING OUT FROM THE SHADOWS OF THE BOUGHS I NEVER SAW SUCH EYES BEFORE
THE OTHERS SURPRISED BY HIS CRY HALTED AND TURNED BUT LEGOLAS STARTED TO RIDE BACK
NO NO CRIED GIMLI DO AS YOU PLEASE IN YOUR MADNESS BUT LET ME FIRST GET DOWN FROM THIS HORSE I WISH TO SEE NO EYES
STAY LEGOLAS GREENLEAF SAID GANDALF DO NOT GO BACK INTO THE WOOD NOT YET NOW IS NOT YOUR TIME
EVEN AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME FORWARD OUT OF THE TREES THREE STRANGE SHAPES AS TALL AS TROLLS THEY WERE TWELVE FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT THEIR STRONG BODIES STOUT AS YOUNG TREES SEEMED TO BE CLAD WITH RAIMENT OR WITH HIDE OF CLOSEFITTING GREY AND BROWN THEIR LIMBS WERE LONG AND THEIR HANDS HAD MANY FINGERS THEIR HAIR WAS STIFF AND THEIR BEARDS GREYGREEN AS MOSS THEY GAZED OUT WITH SOLEMN EYES BUT THEY WERE NOT LOOKING AT THE RIDERS THEIR EYES WERE BENT NORTHWARDS SUDDENLY THEY LIFTED THEIR LONG HANDS TO THEIR MOUTHS AND SENT FORTH RINGING CALLS CLEAR AS NOTES OF A HORN BUT MORE MUSICAL AND VARIOUS THE CALLS WERE ANSWERED AND TURNING AGAIN THE RIDERS SAW OTHER CREATURES OF THE SAME KIND APPROACHING STRIDING THROUGH THE GRASS THEY CAME SWIFTLY FROM THE NORTH WALKING LIKE WADING HERONS IN THEIR GAIT BUT NOT IN THEIR SPEED FOR THEIR LEGS IN THEIR LONG PACES BEAT QUICKER THAN THE HERONS WINGS THE RIDERS CRIED ALOUD IN WONDER AND SOME SET THEIR HANDS UPON THEIR SWORDHILTS
YOU NEED NO WEAPONS SAID GANDALF THESE ARE BUT HERDSMEN THEY ARE NOT ENEMIES INDEED THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH US AT ALL
SO IT SEEMED TO BE FOR AS HE SPOKE THE TALL CREATURES WITHOUT A GLANCE AT THE RIDERS STRODE INTO THE WOOD AND VANISHED
HERDSMEN SAID THEODEN WHERE ARE THEIR FLOCKS WHAT ARE THEY GANDALF FOR IT IS PLAIN THAT TO YOU AT ANY RATE THEY ARE NOT STRANGE
THEY ARE THE SHEPHERDS OF THE TREES ANSWERED GANDALF IS IT SO LONG SINCE YOU LISTENED TO TALES BY THE FIRESIDE THERE ARE CHILDREN IN YOUR LAND WHO OUT OF THE TWISTED THREADS OF STORY COULD PICK THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION YOU HAVE SEEN ENTS O KING ENTS OUT OF FANGORN FOREST WHICH IN YOUR TONGUE YOU CALL THE ENTWOOD DID YOU THINK THAT THE NAME WAS GIVEN ONLY IN IDLE FANCY NAY THEODEN IT IS OTHERWISE TO THEM YOU ARE BUT THE PASSING TALE ALL THE YEARS FROM EORL THE YOUNG TO THEODEN THE OLD ARE OF LITTLE COUNT TO THEM AND ALL THE DEEDS OF YOUR HOUSE BUT A SMALL MATTER
THE KING WAS SILENT ENTS HE SAID AT LENGTH OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF LEGEND I BEGIN A LITTLE TO UNDERSTAND THE MARVEL OF THE TREES I THINK I HAVE LIVED TO SEE STRANGE DAYS LONG WE HAVE TENDED OUR BEASTS AND OUR FIELDS BUILT OUR HOUSES WROUGHT OUR TOOLS OR RIDDEN AWAY TO HELP IN THE WARS OF MINAS TIRITH AND THAT WE CALLED THE LIFE OF MEN THE WAY OF THE WORLD WE CARED LITTLE FOR WHAT LAY BEYOND THE BORDERS OF OUR LAND SONGS WE HAVE THAT TELL OF THESE THINGS BUT WE ARE FORGETTING THEM TEACHING THEM ONLY TO CHILDREN AS A CARELESS CUSTOM AND NOW THE SONGS HAVE COME DOWN AMONG US OUT OF STRANGE PLACES AND WALK VISIBLE UNDER THE SUN
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD THEODEN KING SAID GANDALF FOR NOT ONLY THE LITTLE LIFE OF MEN IS NOW ENDANGERED BUT THE LIFE ALSO OF THOSE THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE DEEMED THE MATTER OF LEGEND YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT ALLIES EVEN IF YOU KNOW THEM NOT
YET ALSO I SHOULD BE SAD SAID THEODEN FOR HOWEVER THE FORTUNE OF WAR SHALL GO MAY IT NOT SO END THAT MUCH THAT WAS FAIR AND WONDERFUL SHALL PASS FOR EVER OUT OF MIDDLEEARTH
IT MAY SAID GANDALF THE EVIL OF SAURON CANNOT BE WHOLLY CURED NOR MADE AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN BUT TO SUCH DAYS WE ARE DOOMED LET US NOW GO ON WITH THE JOURNEY WE HAVE BEGUN
THE COMPANY TURNED THEN AWAY FROM THE COOMB AND FROM THE WOOD AND TOOK THE ROAD TOWARDS THE FORDS LEGOLAS FOLLOWED RELUCTANTLY THE SUN HAD SET ALREADY IT HAD SUNK BEHIND THE RIM OF THE WORLD BUT AS THEY RODE OUT FROM THE SHADOW OF THE HILLS AND LOOKED WEST TO THE GAP OF ROHAN THE SKY WAS STILL RED AND A BURNING LIGHT WAS UNDER THE FLOATING CLOUDS DARK AGAINST IT THERE WHEELED AND FLEW MANY BLACKWINGED BIRDS SOME PASSED OVERHEAD WITH MOURNFUL CRIES RETURNING TO THEIR HOMES AMONG THE ROCKS
THE CARRIONFOWL HAVE BEEN BUSY ABOUT THE BATTLEFIELD SAID EOMER
THEY RODE NOW AT AN EASY PACE AND DARK CAME DOWN UPON THE PLAINS ABOUT THEM THE SLOW MOON MOUNTED NOW WAXING TOWARDS THE FULL AND IN ITS COLD SILVER LIGHT THE SWELLING GRASSLANDS ROSE AND FELL LIKE A WIDE GREY SEA THEY HAD RIDDEN FOR SOME FOUR HOURS FROM THE BRANCHING OF THE ROADS WHEN THEY DREW NEAR TO THE FORDS LONG SLOPES RAN SWIFTLY DOWN TO WHERE THE RIVER SPREAD IN STONY SHOALS BETWEEN HIGH GRASSY TERRACES BORNE UPON THE WIND THEY HEARD THE HOWLING OF WOLVES THEIR HEARTS WERE HEAVY REMEMBERING THE MANY MEN THAT HAD FALLEN IN BATTLE IN THIS PLACE
THE ROAD DIPPED BETWEEN RISING TURFBANKS CARVING ITS WAY THROUGH THE TERRACES TO THE RIVERS EDGE AND UP AGAIN UPON THE FURTHER SIDE THERE WERE THREE LINES OF FLAT STEPPINGSTONES ACROSS THE STREAM AND BETWEEN THEM FORDS FOR HORSES THAT WENT FROM EITHER BRINK TO A BARE EYOT IN THE MIDST THE RIDERS LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CROSSINGS AND IT SEEMED STRANGE TO THEM FOR THE FORDS HAD EVER BEEN A PLACE FULL OF THE RUSH AND CHATTER OF WATER UPON STONES BUT NOW THEY WERE SILENT THE BEDS OF THE STREAM WERE ALMOST DRY A BARE WASTE OF SHINGLES AND GREY SAND
THIS IS BECOME A DREARY PLACE SAID EOMER WHAT SICKNESS HAS BEFALLEN THE RIVER MANY FAIR THINGS SARUMAN HAS DESTROYED HAS HE DEVOURED THE SPRINGS OF ISEN TOO
SO IT WOULD SEEM SAID GANDALF
ALAS SAID THEODEN MUST WE PASS THIS WAY WHERE THE CARRIONBEASTS DEVOUR SO MANY GOOD RIDERS OF THE MARK
THIS IS OUR WAY SAID GANDALF GRIEVOUS IS THE FALL OF YOUR MEN BUT YOU SHALL SEE THAT AT LEAST THE WOLVES OF THE MOUNTAINS DO NOT DEVOUR THEM IT IS WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE ORCS THAT THEY HOLD THEIR FEAST SUCH INDEED IS THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR KIND COME
THEY RODE DOWN TO THE RIVER AND AS THEY CAME THE WOLVES CEASED THEIR HOWLING AND SLUNK AWAY FEAR FELL ON THEM SEEING GANDALF IN THE MOON AND SHADOWFAX HIS HORSE SHINING LIKE SILVER THE RIDERS PASSED OVER TO THE ISLET AND GLITTERING EYES WATCHED THEM WANLY FROM THE SHADOWS OF THE BANKS
LOOK SAID GANDALF FRIENDS HAVE LABOURED HERE
AND THEY SAW THAT IN THE MIDST OF THE EYOT A MOUND WAS PILED RINGED WITH STONES AND SET ABOUT WITH MANY SPEARS
HERE LIE ALL THE MEN OF THE MARK THAT FELL NEAR THIS PLACE SAID GANDALF
HERE LET THEM REST SAID EOMER AND WHEN THEIR SPEARS HAVE ROTTED AND RUSTED LONG STILL MAY THEIR MOUND STAND AND GUARD THE FORDS OF ISEN
IS THIS YOUR WORK ALSO GANDALF MY FRIEND SAID THEODEN YOU ACCOMPLISHED MUCH IN AN EVENING AND A NIGHT
WITH THE HELP OF SHADOWFAX  AND OTHERS SAID GANDALF I RODE FAST AND FAR BUT HERE BESIDE THE MOUND I WILL SAY THIS FOR YOUR COMFORT MANY FELL IN THE BATTLES OF THE FORDS BUT FEWER THAN RUMOUR MADE THEM MORE WERE SCATTERED THAN WERE SLAIN I GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THAT I COULD FIND SOME MEN I SENT WITH GRIMBOLD OF WESTFOLD TO JOIN ERKENBRAND SOME I SET TO MAKE THIS BURIAL THEY HAVE NOW FOLLOWED YOUR MARSHAL ELFHELM I SENT HIM WITH MANY RIDERS TO EDORAS SARUMAN I KNEW HAD DESPATCHED HIS FULL STRENGTH AGAINST YOU AND HIS SERVANTS HAD TURNED ASIDE FROM ALL OTHER ERRANDS AND GONE TO HELMS DEEP THE LANDS SEEMED EMPTY OF ENEMIES YET I FEARED THAT WOLFRIDERS AND PLUNDERERS MIGHT RIDE NONETHELESS TO MEDUSELD WHILE IT WAS UNDEFENDED BUT NOW I THINK YOU NEED NOT FEAR YOU WILL FIND YOUR HOUSE TO WELCOME YOUR RETURN
AND GLAD SHALL I BE TO SEE IT AGAIN SAID THEODEN THOUGH BRIEF NOW I DOUBT NOT SHALL BE MY ABIDING THERE
WITH THAT THE COMPANY SAID FAREWELL TO THE ISLAND AND THE MOUND AND PASSED OVER THE RIVER AND CLIMBED THE FURTHER BANK THEN THEY RODE ON GLAD TO HAVE LEFT THE MOURNFUL FORDS AS THEY WENT THE HOWLING OF THE WOLVES BROKE OUT ANEW
THERE WAS AN ANCIENT HIGHWAY THAT RAN DOWN FROM ISENGARD TO THE CROSSINGS FOR SOME WAY IT TOOK ITS COURSE BESIDE THE RIVER BENDING WITH IT EAST AND THEN NORTH BUT AT THE LAST IT TURNED AWAY AND WENT STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE GATES OF ISENGARD AND THESE WERE UNDER THE MOUNTAINSIDE IN THE WEST OF THE VALLEY SIXTEEN MILES OR MORE FROM ITS MOUTH THIS ROAD THEY FOLLOWED BUT THEY DID NOT RIDE UPON IT FOR THE GROUND BESIDE IT WAS FIRM AND LEVEL COVERED FOR MANY MILES ABOUT WITH SHORT SPRINGING TURF THEY RODE NOW MORE SWIFTLY AND BY MIDNIGHT THE FORDS WERE NEARLY FIVE LEAGUES BEHIND THEN THEY HALTED ENDING THEIR NIGHTS JOURNEY FOR THE KING WAS WEARY THEY WERE COME TO THE FEET OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND THE LONG ARMS OF NAN CURUNIR STRETCHED DOWN TO MEET THEM DARK LAY THE VALE BEFORE THEM FOR THE MOON HAD PASSED INTO THE WEST AND ITS LIGHT WAS HIDDEN BY THE HILLS BUT OUT OF THE DEEP SHADOW OF THE DALE ROSE A VAST SPIRE OF SMOKE AND VAPOUR AS IT MOUNTED IT CAUGHT THE RAYS OF THE SINKING MOON AND SPREAD IN SHIMMERING BILLOWS BLACK AND SILVER OVER THE STARRY SKY
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT GANDALF ASKED ARAGORN ONE WOULD SAY THAT ALL THE WIZARDS VALE WAS BURNING
THERE IS EVER A FUME ABOVE THAT VALLEY IN THESE DAYS SAID EOMER BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN AUGHT LIKE THIS BEFORE THESE ARE STEAMS RATHER THAN SMOKES SARUMAN IS BREWING SOME DEVILRY TO GREET US MAYBE HE IS BOILING ALL THE WATERS OF ISEN AND THAT IS WHY THE RIVER RUNS DRY
MAYBE HE IS SAID GANDALF TOMORROW WE SHALL LEARN WHAT HE IS DOING NOW LET US REST FOR A WHILE IF WE CAN
THEY CAMPED BESIDE THE BED OF THE ISEN RIVER IT WAS STILL SILENT AND EMPTY SOME OF THEM SLEPT A LITTLE BUT LATE IN THE NIGHT THE WATCHMEN CRIED OUT AND ALL AWOKE THE MOON WAS GONE STARS WERE SHINING ABOVE BUT OVER THE GROUND THERE CREPT A DARKNESS BLACKER THAN THE NIGHT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER IT ROLLED TOWARDS THEM GOING NORTHWARD
STAY WHERE YOU ARE SAID GANDALF DRAW NO WEAPONS WAIT AND IT WILL PASS YOU BY
A MIST GATHERED ABOUT THEM ABOVE THEM A FEW STARS STILL GLIMMERED FAINTLY BUT ON EITHER SIDE THERE AROSE WALLS OF IMPENETRABLE GLOOM THEY WERE IN A NARROW LANE BETWEEN MOVING TOWERS OF SHADOW VOICES THEY HEARD WHISPERINGS AND GROANINGS AND AN ENDLESS RUSTLING SIGH THE EARTH SHOOK UNDER THEM LONG IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEY SAT AND WERE AFRAID BUT AT LAST THE DARKNESS AND THE RUMOUR PASSED AND VANISHED BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS ARMS
AWAY SOUTH UPON THE HORNBURG IN THE MIDDLE NIGHT MEN HEARD A GREAT NOISE AS A WIND IN THE VALLEY AND THE GROUND TREMBLED AND ALL WERE AFRAID AND NO ONE VENTURED TO GO FORTH BUT IN THE MORNING THEY WENT OUT AND WERE AMAZED FOR THE SLAIN ORCS WERE GONE AND THE TREES ALSO FAR DOWN INTO THE VALLEY OF THE DEEP THE GRASS WAS CRUSHED AND TRAMPLED BROWN AS IF GIANT HERDSMEN HAD PASTURED GREAT DROVES OF CATTLE THERE BUT A MILE BELOW THE DIKE A HUGE PIT HAD BEEN DELVED IN THE EARTH AND OVER IT STONES WERE PILED INTO A HILL MEN BELIEVED THAT THE ORCS WHOM THEY HAD SLAIN WERE BURIED THERE BUT WHETHER THOSE WHO HAD FLED INTO THE WOOD WERE WITH THEM NONE COULD SAY FOR NO MAN EVER SET FOOT UPON THAT HILL THE DEATH DOWN IT WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED AND NO GRASS WOULD GROW THERE BUT THE STRANGE TREES WERE NEVER SEEN IN DEEPINGCOOMB AGAIN THEY HAD RETURNED AT NIGHT AND HAD GONE FAR AWAY TO THE DARK DALES OF FANGORN THUS THEY WERE REVENGED UPON THE ORCS
THE KING AND HIS COMPANY SLEPT NO MORE THAT NIGHT BUT THEY SAW AND HEARD NO OTHER STRANGE THING SAVE ONE THE VOICE OF THE RIVER BESIDE THEM SUDDENLY AWOKE THERE WAS A RUSH OF WATER HURRYING DOWN AMONG THE STONES AND WHEN IT HAD PASSED THE ISEN FLOWED AND BUBBLED IN ITS BED AGAIN AS IT HAD EVER DONE
AT DAWN THEY MADE READY TO GO ON THE LIGHT CAME GREY AND PALE AND THEY DID NOT SEE THE RISING OF THE SUN THE AIR ABOVE WAS HEAVY WITH FOG AND A REEK LAY ON THE LAND ABOUT THEM THEY WENT SLOWLY RIDING NOW UPON THE HIGHWAY IT WAS BROAD AND HARD AND WELLTENDED DIMLY THROUGH THE MISTS THEY COULD DESCRY THE LONG ARM OF THE MOUNTAINS RISING ON THEIR LEFT THEY HAD PASSED INTO NAN CURUNIR THE WIZARDS VALE THAT WAS A SHELTERED VALLEY OPEN ONLY TO THE SOUTH ONCE IT HAD BEEN FAIR AND GREEN AND THROUGH IT THE ISEN FLOWED ALREADY DEEP AND STRONG BEFORE IT FOUND THE PLAINS FOR IT WAS FED BY MANY SPRINGS AND LESSER STREAMS AMONG THE RAINWASHED HILLS AND ALL ABOUT IT THERE HAD LAIN A PLEASANT FERTILE LAND
IT WAS NOT SO NOW BENEATH THE WALLS OF ISENGARD THERE STILL WERE ACRES TILLED BY THE SLAVES OF SARUMAN BUT MOST OF THE VALLEY HAD BECOME A WILDERNESS OF WEEDS AND THORNS BRAMBLES TRAILED UPON THE GROUND OR CLAMBERING OVER BUSH AND BANK MADE SHAGGY CAVES WHERE SMALL BEASTS HOUSED NO TREES GREW THERE BUT AMONG THE RANK GRASSES COULD STILL BE SEEN THE BURNED AND AXEHEWN STUMPS OF ANCIENT GROVES IT WAS A SAD COUNTRY SILENT NOW BUT FOR THE STONY NOISE OF QUICK WATERS SMOKES AND STEAMS DRIFTED IN SULLEN CLOUDS AND LURKED IN THE HOLLOWS THE RIDERS DID NOT SPEAK MANY DOUBTED IN THEIR HEARTS WONDERING TO WHAT DISMAL END THEIR JOURNEY LED
AFTER THEY HAD RIDDEN FOR SOME MILES THE HIGHWAY BECAME A WIDE STREET PAVED WITH GREAT FLAT STONES SQUARED AND LAID WITH SKILL NO BLADE OF GRASS WAS SEEN IN ANY JOINT DEEP GUTTERS FILLED WITH TRICKLING WATER RAN DOWN ON EITHER SIDE SUDDENLY A TALL PILLAR LOOMED UP BEFORE THEM IT WAS BLACK AND SET UPON IT WAS A GREAT STONE CARVED AND PAINTED IN THE LIKENESS OF A LONG WHITE HAND ITS FINGER POINTED NORTH NOT FAR NOW THEY KNEW THAT THE GATES OF ISENGARD MUST STAND AND THEIR HEARTS WERE HEAVY BUT THEIR EYES COULD NOT PIERCE THE MISTS AHEAD
BENEATH THE MOUNTAINS ARM WITHIN THE WIZARDS VALE THROUGH YEARS UNCOUNTED HAD STOOD THAT ANCIENT PLACE THAT MEN CALLED ISENGARD PARTLY IT WAS SHAPED IN THE MAKING OF THE MOUNTAINS BUT MIGHTY WORKS THE MEN OF WESTERNESSE HAD WROUGHT THERE OF OLD AND SARUMAN HAD DWELT THERE LONG AND HAD NOT BEEN IDLE
THIS WAS ITS FASHION WHILE SARUMAN WAS AT HIS HEIGHT ACCOUNTED BY MANY THE CHIEF OF WIZARDS A GREAT RINGWALL OF STONE LIKE TOWERING CLIFFS STOOD OUT FROM THE SHELTER OF THE MOUNTAINSIDE FROM WHICH IT RAN AND THEN RETURNED AGAIN ONE ENTRANCE ONLY WAS THERE MADE IN IT A GREAT ARCH DELVED IN THE SOUTHERN WALL HERE THROUGH THE BLACK ROCK A LONG TUNNEL HAD BEEN HEWN CLOSED AT EITHER END WITH MIGHTY DOORS OF IRON THEY WERE SO WROUGHT AND POISED UPON THEIR HUGE HINGES POSTS OF STEEL DRIVEN INTO THE LIVING STONE THAT WHEN UNBARRED THEY COULD BE MOVED WITH A LIGHT THRUST OF THE ARMS NOISELESSLY ONE WHO PASSED IN AND CAME AT LENGTH OUT OF THE ECHOING TUNNEL BEHELD A PLAIN A GREAT CIRCLE SOMEWHAT HOLLOWED LIKE A VAST SHALLOW BOWL A MILE IT MEASURED FROM RIM TO RIM ONCE IT HAD BEEN GREEN AND FILLED WITH AVENUES AND GROVES OF FRUITFUL TREES WATERED BY STREAMS THAT FLOWED FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO A LAKE BUT NO GREEN THING GREW THERE IN THE LATTER DAYS OF SARUMAN THE ROADS WERE PAVED WITH STONEFLAGS DARK AND HARD AND BESIDE THEIR BORDERS INSTEAD OF TREES THERE MARCHED LONG LINES OF PILLARS SOME OF MARBLE SOME OF COPPER AND OF IRON JOINED BY HEAVY CHAINS
MANY HOUSES THERE WERE CHAMBERS HALLS AND PASSAGES CUT AND TUNNELLED BACK INTO THE WALLS UPON THEIR INNER SIDE SO THAT ALL THE OPEN CIRCLE WAS OVERLOOKED BY COUNTLESS WINDOWS AND DARK DOORS THOUSANDS COULD DWELL THERE WORKERS SERVANTS SLAVES AND WARRIORS WITH GREAT STORE OF ARMS WOLVES WERE FED AND STABLED IN DEEP DENS BENEATH THE PLAIN TOO WAS BORED AND DELVED SHAFTS WERE DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE GROUND THEIR UPPER ENDS WERE COVERED BY LOW MOUNDS AND DOMES OF STONE SO THAT IN THE MOONLIGHT THE RING OF ISENGARD LOOKED LIKE A GRAVEYARD OF UNQUIET DEAD FOR THE GROUND TREMBLED THE SHAFTS RAN DOWN BY MANY SLOPES AND SPIRAL STAIRS TO CAVERNS FAR UNDER THERE SARUMAN HAD TREASURIES STOREHOUSES ARMOURIES SMITHIES AND GREAT FURNACES IRON WHEELS REVOLVED THERE ENDLESSLY AND HAMMERS THUDDED AT NIGHT PLUMES OF VAPOUR STEAMED FROM THE VENTS LIT FROM BENEATH WITH RED LIGHT OR BLUE OR VENOMOUS GREEN
TO THE CENTRE ALL THE ROADS RAN BETWEEN THEIR CHAINS THERE STOOD A TOWER OF MARVELLOUS SHAPE IT WAS FASHIONED BY THE BUILDERS OF OLD WHO SMOOTHED THE RING OF ISENGARD AND YET IT SEEMED A THING NOT MADE BY THE CRAFT OF MEN BUT RIVEN FROM THE BONES OF THE EARTH IN THE ANCIENT TORMENT OF THE HILLS A PEAK AND ISLE OF ROCK IT WAS BLACK AND GLEAMING HARD FOUR MIGHTY PIERS OF MANYSIDED STONE WERE WELDED INTO ONE BUT NEAR THE SUMMIT THEY OPENED INTO GAPING HORNS THEIR PINNACLES SHARP AS THE POINTS OF SPEARS KEENEDGED AS KNIVES BETWEEN THEM WAS A NARROW SPACE AND THERE UPON A FLOOR OF POLISHED STONE WRITTEN WITH STRANGE SIGNS A MAN MIGHT STAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE PLAIN THIS WAS ORTHANC THE CITADEL OF SARUMAN THE NAME OF WHICH HAD BY DESIGN OR CHANCE A TWOFOLD MEANING FOR IN THE ELVISH SPEECH ORTHANC SIGNIFIES MOUNT FANG BUT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MARK OF OLD THE CUNNING MIND
A STRONG PLACE AND WONDERFUL WAS ISENGARD AND LONG IT HAD BEEN BEAUTIFUL AND THERE GREAT LORDS HAD DWELT THE WARDENS OF GONDOR UPON THE WEST AND WISE MEN THAT WATCHED THE STARS BUT SARUMAN HAD SLOWLY SHAPED IT TO HIS SHIFTING PURPOSES AND MADE IT BETTER AS HE THOUGHT BEING DECEIVED  FOR ALL THOSE ARTS AND SUBTLE DEVICES FOR WHICH HE FORSOOK HIS FORMER WISDOM AND WHICH FONDLY HE IMAGINED WERE HIS OWN CAME BUT FROM MORDOR SO THAT WHAT HE MADE WAS NAUGHT ONLY A LITTLE COPY A CHILDS MODEL OR A SLAVES FLATTERY OF THAT VAST FORTRESS ARMOURY PRISON FURNACE OF GREAT POWER BARADDUR THE DARK TOWER WHICH SUFFERED NO RIVAL AND LAUGHED AT FLATTERY BIDING ITS TIME SECURE IN ITS PRIDE AND ITS IMMEASURABLE STRENGTH
THIS WAS THE STRONGHOLD OF SARUMAN AS FAME REPORTED IT FOR WITHIN LIVING MEMORY THE MEN OF ROHAN HAD NOT PASSED ITS GATES SAVE PERHAPS A FEW SUCH AS WORMTONGUE WHO CAME IN SECRET AND TOLD NO MAN WHAT THEY SAW
NOW GANDALF RODE TO THE GREAT PILLAR OF THE HAND AND PASSED IT AND AS HE DID SO THE RIDERS SAW TO THEIR WONDER THAT THE HAND APPEARED NO LONGER WHITE IT WAS STAINED AS WITH DRIED BLOOD AND LOOKING CLOSER THEY PERCEIVED THAT ITS NAILS WERE RED UNHEEDING GANDALF RODE ON INTO THE MIST AND RELUCTANTLY THEY FOLLOWED HIM ALL ABOUT THEM NOW AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A SUDDEN FLOOD WIDE POOLS OF WATER LAY BESIDE THE ROAD FILLING THE HOLLOWS AND RILLS WENT TRICKLING DOWN AMONG THE STONES
AT LAST GANDALF HALTED AND BECKONED TO THEM AND THEY CAME AND SAW THAT BEYOND HIM THE MISTS HAD CLEARED AND A PALE SUNLIGHT SHONE THE HOUR OF NOON HAD PASSED THEY WERE COME TO THE DOORS OF ISENGARD
BUT THE DOORS LAY HURLED AND TWISTED ON THE GROUND AND ALL ABOUT STONE CRACKED AND SPLINTERED INTO COUNTLESS JAGGED SHARDS WAS SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE OR PILED IN RUINOUS HEAPS THE GREAT ARCH STILL STOOD BUT IT OPENED NOW UPON A ROOFLESS CHASM THE TUNNEL WAS LAID BARE AND THROUGH THE CLIFFLIKE WALLS ON EITHER SIDE GREAT RENTS AND BREACHES HAD BEEN TORN THEIR TOWERS WERE BEATEN INTO DUST IF THE GREAT SEA HAD RISEN IN WRATH AND FALLEN ON THE HILLS WITH STORM IT COULD HAVE WORKED NO GREATER RUIN
THE RING BEYOND WAS FILLED WITH STEAMING WATER A BUBBLING CAULDRON IN WHICH THERE HEAVED AND FLOATED A WRECKAGE OF BEAMS AND SPARS CHESTS AND CASKS AND BROKEN GEAR TWISTED AND LEANING PILLARS REARED THEIR SPLINTERED STEMS ABOVE THE FLOOD BUT ALL THE ROADS WERE DROWNED FAR OFF IT SEEMED HALF VEILED IN WINDING CLOUD THERE LOOMED THE ISLAND ROCK STILL DARK AND TALL UNBROKEN BY THE STORM THE TOWER OF ORTHANC STOOD PALE WATERS LAPPED ABOUT ITS FEET
THE KING AND ALL HIS COMPANY SAT SILENT ON THEIR HORSES MARVELLING PERCEIVING THAT THE POWER OF SARUMAN WAS OVERTHROWN BUT HOW THEY COULD NOT GUESS AND NOW THEY TURNED THEIR EYES TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY AND THE RUINED GATES THERE THEY SAW CLOSE BESIDE THEM A GREAT RUBBLEHEAP AND SUDDENLY THEY WERE AWARE OF TWO SMALL FIGURES LYING ON IT AT THEIR EASE GREYCLAD HARDLY TO BE SEEN AMONG THE STONES THERE WERE BOTTLES AND BOWLS AND PLATTERS LAID BESIDE THEM AS IF THEY HAD JUST EATEN WELL AND NOW RESTED FROM THEIR LABOUR ONE SEEMED ASLEEP THE OTHER WITH CROSSED LEGS AND ARMS BEHIND HIS HEAD LEANED BACK AGAINST A BROKEN ROCK AND SENT FROM HIS MOUTH LONG WISPS AND LITTLE RINGS OF THIN BLUE SMOKE
FOR A MOMENT THEODEN AND EOMER AND ALL HIS MEN STARED AT THEM IN WONDER AMID ALL THE WRECK OF ISENGARD THIS SEEMED TO THEM THE STRANGEST SIGHT BUT BEFORE THE KING COULD SPEAK THE SMALL SMOKEBREATHING FIGURE BECAME SUDDENLY AWARE OF THEM AS THEY SAT THERE SILENT ON THE EDGE OF THE MIST HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET A YOUNG MAN HE LOOKED OR LIKE ONE THOUGH NOT MUCH MORE THAN HALF A MAN IN HEIGHT HIS HEAD OF BROWN CURLING HAIR WAS UNCOVERED BUT HE WAS CLAD IN A TRAVELSTAINED CLOAK OF THE SAME HUE AND SHAPE AS THE COMPANIONS OF GANDALF HAD WORN WHEN THEY RODE TO EDORAS HE BOWED VERY LOW PUTTING HIS HAND UPON HIS BREAST THEN SEEMING NOT TO OBSERVE THE WIZARD AND HIS FRIENDS HE TURNED TO EOMER AND THE KING
WELCOME MY LORDS TO ISENGARD HE SAID WE ARE THE DOORWARDENS MERIADOC SON OF SARADOC IS MY NAME AND MY COMPANION WHO ALAS IS OVERCOME WITH WEARINESS  HERE HE GAVE THE OTHER A DIG WITH HIS FOOT  IS PEREGRIN SON OF PALADIN OF THE HOUSE OF TOOK FAR IN THE NORTH IS OUR HOME THE LORD SARUMAN IS WITHIN BUT AT THE MOMENT HE IS CLOSETED WITH ONE WORMTONGUE OR DOUBTLESS HE WOULD BE HERE TO WELCOME SUCH HONOURABLE GUESTS
DOUBTLESS HE WOULD LAUGHED GANDALF AND WAS IT SARUMAN THAT ORDERED YOU TO GUARD HIS DAMAGED DOORS AND WATCH FOR THE ARRIVAL OF GUESTS WHEN YOUR ATTENTION COULD BE SPARED FROM PLATE AND BOTTLE
NO GOOD SIR THE MATTER ESCAPED HIM ANSWERED MERRY GRAVELY HE HAS BEEN MUCH OCCUPIED OUR ORDERS CAME FROM TREEBEARD WHO HAS TAKEN OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF ISENGARD HE COMMANDED ME TO WELCOME THE LORD OF ROHAN WITH FITTING WORDS I HAVE DONE MY BEST
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR COMPANIONS WHAT ABOUT LEGOLAS AND ME CRIED GIMLI UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIMSELF LONGER YOU RASCALS YOU WOOLLYFOOTED AND WOOLPATED TRUANTS A FINE HUNT YOU HAVE LED US TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES THROUGH FEN AND FOREST BATTLE AND DEATH TO RESCUE YOU AND HERE WE FIND YOU FEASTING AND IDLING  AND SMOKING SMOKING WHERE DID YOU COME BY THE WEED YOU VILLAINS HAMMER AND TONGS I AM SO TORN BETWEEN RAGE AND JOY THAT IF I DO NOT BURST IT WILL BE A MARVEL
YOU SPEAK FOR ME GIMLI LAUGHED LEGOLAS THOUGH I WOULD SOONER LEARN HOW THEY CAME BY THE WINE
ONE THING YOU HAVE NOT FOUND IN YOUR HUNTING AND THATS BRIGHTER WITS SAID PIPPIN OPENING AN EYE HERE YOU FIND US SITTING ON A FIELD OF VICTORY AMID THE PLUNDER OF ARMIES AND YOU WONDER HOW WE CAME BY A FEW WELLEARNED COMFORTS
WELLEARNED SAID GIMLI I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
THE RIDERS LAUGHED IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT WE WITNESS THE MEETING OF DEAR FRIENDS SAID THEODEN SO THESE ARE THE LOST ONES OF YOUR COMPANY GANDALF THE DAYS ARE FATED TO BE FILLED WITH MARVELS ALREADY I HAVE SEEN MANY SINCE I LEFT MY HOUSE AND NOW HERE BEFORE MY EYES STAND YET ANOTHER OF THE FOLK OF LEGEND ARE NOT THESE THE HALFLINGS THAT SOME AMONG US CALL THE HOLBYTLAN
HOBBITS IF YOU PLEASE LORD SAID PIPPIN
HOBBITS SAID THEODEN YOUR TONGUE IS STRANGELY CHANGED BUT THE NAME SOUNDS NOT UNFITTING SO HOBBITS NO REPORT THAT I HAVE HEARD DOES JUSTICE TO THE TRUTH
MERRY BOWED AND PIPPIN GOT UP AND BOWED LOW YOU ARE GRACIOUS LORD OR I HOPE THAT I MAY SO TAKE YOUR WORDS HE SAID AND HERE IS ANOTHER MARVEL I HAVE WANDERED IN MANY LANDS SINCE I LEFT MY HOME AND NEVER TILL NOW HAVE I FOUND PEOPLE THAT KNEW ANY STORY CONCERNING HOBBITS
MY PEOPLE CAME OUT OF THE NORTH LONG AGO SAID THEODEN BUT I WILL NOT DECEIVE YOU WE KNOW NO TALES ABOUT HOBBITS ALL THAT IS SAID AMONG US IS THAT FAR AWAY OVER MANY HILLS AND RIVERS LIVE THE HALFLING FOLK THAT DWELL IN HOLES IN SANDDUNES BUT THERE ARE NO LEGENDS OF THEIR DEEDS FOR IT IS SAID THAT THEY DO LITTLE AND AVOID THE SIGHT OF MEN BEING ABLE TO VANISH IN A TWINKLING AND THEY CAN CHANGE THEIR VOICES TO RESEMBLE THE PIPING OF BIRDS BUT IT SEEMS THAT MORE COULD BE SAID
IT COULD INDEED LORD SAID MERRY
FOR ONE THING SAID THEODEN I HAD NOT HEARD THAT THEY SPOUTED SMOKE FROM THEIR MOUTHS
THAT IS NOT SURPRISING ANSWERED MERRY FOR IT IS AN ART WHICH WE HAVE NOT PRACTISED FOR MORE THAN A FEW GENERATIONS IT WAS TOBOLD HORNBLOWER OF LONGBOTTOM IN THE SOUTHFARTHING WHO FIRST GREW THE TRUE PIPEWEED IN HIS GARDENS ABOUT THE YEAR 1070 ACCORDING TO OUR RECKONING HOW OLD TOBY CAME BY THE PLANT
YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR DANGER THEODEN INTERRUPTED GANDALF THESE HOBBITS WILL SIT ON THE EDGE OF RUIN AND DISCUSS THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE OR THE SMALL DOINGS OF THEIR FATHERS GRANDFATHERS AND GREATGRANDFATHERS AND REMOTER COUSINS TO THE NINTH DEGREE IF YOU ENCOURAGE THEM WITH UNDUE PATIENCE SOME OTHER TIME WOULD BE MORE FITTING FOR THE HISTORY OF SMOKING WHERE IS TREEBEARD MERRY
AWAY ON THE NORTH SIDE I BELIEVE HE WENT TO GET A DRINK OF CLEAN WATER MOST OF THE OTHER ENTS ARE WITH HIM STILL BUSY AT THEIR WORK  OVER THERE MERRY WAVED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE STEAMING LAKE AND AS THEY LOOKED THEY HEARD A DISTANT RUMBLING AND RATTLING AS IF AN AVALANCHE WAS FALLING FROM THE MOUNTAINSIDE FAR AWAY CAME A HOOMHOM AS OF HORNS BLOWING TRIUMPHANTLY
AND IS ORTHANC THEN LEFT UNGUARDED ASKED GANDALF
THERE IS THE WATER SAID MERRY BUT QUICKBEAM AND SOME OTHERS ARE WATCHING IT NOT ALL THOSE POSTS AND PILLARS IN THE PLAIN ARE OF SARUMANS PLANTING QUICKBEAM I THINK IS BY THE ROCK NEAR THE FOOT OF THE STAIR
YES A TALL GREY ENT IS THERE SAID LEGOLAS BUT HIS ARMS ARE AT HIS SIDES AND HE STANDS AS STILL AS A DOORTREE
IT IS PAST NOON SAID GANDALF AND WE AT ANY RATE HAVE NOT EATEN SINCE EARLY MORNING YET I WISH TO SEE TREEBEARD AS SOON AS MAY BE DID HE LEAVE ME NO MESSAGE OR HAS PLATE AND BOTTLE DRIVEN IT FROM YOUR MIND
HE LEFT A MESSAGE SAID MERRY AND I WAS COMING TO IT BUT I HAVE BEEN HINDERED BY MANY OTHER QUESTIONS I WAS TO SAY THAT IF THE LORD OF THE MARK AND GANDALF WILL RIDE TO THE NORTHERN WALL THEY WILL FIND TREEBEARD THERE AND HE WILL WELCOME THEM I MAY ADD THAT THEY WILL ALSO FIND FOOD OF THE BEST THERE IT WAS DISCOVERED AND SELECTED BY YOUR HUMBLE SERVANTS HE BOWED
GANDALF LAUGHED THAT IS BETTER HE SAID WELL THEODEN WILL YOU RIDE WITH ME TO FIND TREEBEARD WE MUST GO ROUND ABOUT BUT IT IS NOT FAR WHEN YOU SEE TREEBEARD YOU WILL LEARN MUCH FOR TREEBEARD IS FANGORN AND THE ELDEST AND CHIEF OF THE ENTS AND WHEN YOU SPEAK WITH HIM YOU WILL HEAR THE SPEECH OF THE OLDEST OF ALL LIVING THINGS
I WILL COME WITH YOU SAID THEODEN FAREWELL MY HOBBITS MAY WE MEET AGAIN IN MY HOUSE THERE YOU SHALL SIT BESIDE ME AND TELL ME ALL THAT YOUR HEARTS DESIRE THE DEEDS OF YOUR GRANDSIRES AS FAR AS YOU CAN RECKON THEM AND WE WILL SPEAK ALSO OF TOBOLD THE OLD AND HIS HERBLORE FAREWELL
THE HOBBITS BOWED LOW SO THAT IS THE KING OF ROHAN SAID PIPPIN IN AN UNDERTONE A FINE OLD FELLOW VERY POLITE



CHAPTER 9
FLOTSAM AND JETSAM

GANDALF AND THE KINGS COMPANY RODE AWAY TURNING EASTWARD TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT OF THE RUINED WALLS OF ISENGARD BUT ARAGORN GIMLI AND LEGOLAS REMAINED BEHIND LEAVING AROD AND HASUFEL TO STRAY IN SEARCH OF GRASS THEY CAME AND SAT BESIDE THE HOBBITS
WELL WELL THE HUNT IS OVER AND WE MEET AGAIN AT LAST WHERE NONE OF US EVER THOUGHT TO COME SAID ARAGORN
AND NOW THAT THE GREAT ONES HAVE GONE TO DISCUSS HIGH MATTERS SAID LEGOLAS THE HUNTERS CAN PERHAPS LEARN THE ANSWERS TO THEIR OWN SMALL RIDDLES WE TRACKED YOU AS FAR AS THE FOREST BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY THINGS THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF
AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO THAT WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU SAID MERRY WE HAVE LEARNT A FEW THINGS THROUGH TREEBEARD THE OLD ENT BUT THAT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH
ALL IN GOOD TIME SAID LEGOLAS WE WERE THE HUNTERS AND YOU SHOULD GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOURSELVES TO US FIRST
OR SECOND SAID GIMLI IT WOULD GO BETTER AFTER A MEALI HAVE A SORE HEAD AND IT IS PAST MIDDAY YOU TRUANTS MIGHT MAKE AMENDS BY FINDING US SOME OF THE PLUNDER THAT YOU SPOKE OF FOOD AND DRINK WOULD PAY OFF SOME OF MY SCORE AGAINST YOU
THEN YOU SHALL HAVE IT SAID PIPPIN WILL YOU HAVE IT HERE OR IN MORE COMFORT IN WHATS LEFT OF SARUMANS GUARDHOUSE  OVER THERE UNDER THE ARCH WE HAD TO PICNIC OUT HERE SO AS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE ROAD
LESS THAN AN EYE SAID GIMLI BUT I WILL NOT GO INTO ANY ORCHOUSE NOR TOUCH ORCS MEAT OR ANYTHING THAT THEY HAVE MAULED
WE WOULDNT ASK YOU TO SAID MERRY WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF ORCS OURSELVES TO LAST A LIFETIME BUT THERE WERE MANY OTHER FOLK IN ISENGARD SARUMAN KEPT ENOUGH WISDOM NOT TO TRUST HIS ORCS HE HAD MEN TO GUARD HIS GATES SOME OF HIS MOST FAITHFUL SERVANTS I SUPPOSE ANYWAY THEY WERE FAVOURED AND GOT GOOD PROVISIONS
AND PIPEWEED ASKED GIMLI
NO I DONT THINK SO MERRY LAUGHED BUT THAT IS ANOTHER STORY WHICH CAN WAIT UNTIL AFTER LUNCH
WELL LET US GO AND HAVE LUNCH THEN SAID THE DWARF
THE HOBBITS LED THE WAY AND THEY PASSED UNDER THE ARCH AND CAME TO A WIDE DOOR UPON THE LEFT AT THE TOP OF A STAIR IT OPENED DIRECT INTO A LARGE CHAMBER WITH OTHER SMALLER DOORS AT THE FAR END AND A HEARTH AND CHIMNEY AT ONE SIDE THE CHAMBER WAS HEWN OUT OF THE STONE AND IT MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN DARK FOR ITS WINDOWS LOOKED OUT ONLY INTO THE TUNNEL BUT LIGHT CAME IN NOW THROUGH THE BROKEN ROOF ON THE HEARTH WOOD WAS BURNING
I LIT A BIT OF FIRE SAID PIPPIN IT CHEERED US UP IN THE FOGS THERE WERE FEW FAGGOTS ABOUT AND MOST OF THE WOOD WE COULD FIND WAS WET BUT THERE IS A GREAT DRAUGHT IN THE CHIMNEY IT SEEMS TO WIND AWAY UP THROUGH THE ROCK AND FORTUNATELY IT HAS NOT BEEN BLOCKED A FIRE IS HANDY I WILL MAKE YOU SOME TOAST THE BREAD IS THREE OR FOUR DAYS OLD I AM AFRAID
ARAGORN AND HIS COMPANIONS SAT THEMSELVES DOWN AT ONE END OF A LONG TABLE AND THE HOBBITS DISAPPEARED THROUGH ONE OF THE INNER DOORS STOREROOM IN THERE AND ABOVE THE WOODS LUCKILY SAID PIPPIN AS THEY CAME BACK LADEN WITH DISHES BOWLS CUPS KNIVES AND FOOD OF VARIOUS SORTS
AND YOU NEED NOT TURN UP YOUR NOSE AT THE PROVENDER MASTER GIMLI SAID MERRY THIS IS NOT ORCSTUFF BUT MANFOOD AS TREEBEARD CALLS IT WILL YOU HAVE WINE OR BEER THERES A BARREL INSIDE THERE  VERY PASSABLE AND THIS IS FIRSTRATE SALTED PORK OR I CAN CUT YOU SOME RASHERS OF BACON AND BROIL THEM IF YOU LIKE I AM SORRY THERE IS NO GREEN STUFF THE DELIVERIES HAVE BEEN RATHER INTERRUPTED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS I CANNOT OFFER YOU ANYTHING TO FOLLOW BUT BUTTER AND HONEY FOR YOUR BREAD ARE YOU CONTENT
INDEED YES SAID GIMLI THE SCORE IS MUCH REDUCED
THE THREE WERE SOON BUSY WITH THEIR MEAL AND THE TWO HOBBITS UNABASHED SET TO A SECOND TIME WE MUST KEEP OUR GUESTS COMPANY THEY SAID
YOU ARE FULL OF COURTESY THIS MORNING LAUGHED LEGOLAS BUT MAYBE IF WE HAD NOT ARRIVED YOU WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN KEEPING ONE ANOTHER COMPANY AGAIN
MAYBE AND WHY NOT SAID PIPPIN WE HAD FOUL FARE WITH THE ORCS AND LITTLE ENOUGH FOR DAYS BEFORE THAT IT SEEMS A LONG WHILE SINCE WE COULD EAT TO HEARTS CONTENT
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE DONE YOU ANY HARM SAID ARAGORN INDEED YOU LOOK IN THE BLOOM OF HEALTH
AYE YOU DO INDEED SAID GIMLI LOOKING THEM UP AND DOWN OVER THE TOP OF HIS CUP WHY YOUR HAIR IS TWICE AS THICK AND CURLY AS WHEN WE PARTED AND I WOULD SWEAR THAT YOU HAVE BOTH GROWN SOMEWHAT IF THAT IS POSSIBLE FOR HOBBITS OF YOUR AGE THIS TREEBEARD AT ANY RATE HAS NOT STARVED YOU
HE HAS NOT SAID MERRY BUT ENTS ONLY DRINK AND DRINK IS NOT ENOUGH FOR CONTENT TREEBEARDS DRAUGHTS MAY BE NOURISHING BUT ONE FEELS THE NEED OF SOMETHING SOLID AND EVEN LEMBAS IS NONE THE WORSE FOR A CHANGE
YOU HAVE DRUNK OF THE WATERS OF THE ENTS HAVE YOU SAID LEGOLAS AH THEN I THINK IT IS LIKELY THAT GIMLIS EYES DO NOT DECEIVE HIM STRANGE SONGS HAVE BEEN SUNG OF THE DRAUGHTS OF FANGORN
MANY STRANGE TALES HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT THAT LAND SAID ARAGORN I HAVE NEVER ENTERED IT COME TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT AND ABOUT THE ENTS
ENTS SAID PIPPIN ENTS ARE  WELL ENTS ARE ALL DIFFERENT FOR ON THING BUT THEIR EYES NOW THEIR EYES ARE VERY ODD HE TRIED A FEW FUMBLING WORDS THAT TRAILED OFF INTO SILENCE OH WELL HE WENT ON YOU HAVE SEEN SOME AT A DISTANCE ALREADYTHEY SAW YOU AT ANY RATE AND REPORTED THAT YOU WERE ON THE WAYAND YOU WILL SEE MANY OTHERS I EXPECT BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE YOU MUST FORM YOUR OWN IDEAS
NOW NOW SAID GIMLI WE ARE BEGINNING THE STORY IN THE MIDDLE I SHOULD LIKE A TALE IN THE RIGHT ORDER STARTING WITH THAT STRANGE DAY WHEN OUR FELLOWSHIP WAS BROKEN
YOU SHALL HAVE IT IF THERE IS TIME SAID MERRY BUT FIRST  IF YOU HAVE FINISHED EATING  YOU SHALL FILL YOUR PIPES AND LIGHT UP AND THEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE WE CAN PRETEND THAT WE ARE ALL BACK SAFE AT BREE AGAIN OR IN RIVENDELL
HE PRODUCED A SMALL LEATHER BAG FULL OF TOBACCO WE HAVE HEAPS OF IT HE SAID AND YOU CAN ALL PACK AS MUCH AS YOU WISH WHEN WE GO WE DID SOME SALVAGEWORK THIS MORNING PIPPIN AND I THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS FLOATING ABOUT IT WAS PIPPIN WHO FOUND TWO SMALL BARRELS WASHED UP OUT OF SOME CELLAR OR STOREHOUSE I SUPPOSE WHEN WE OPENED THEM WE FOUND THEY WERE FILLED WITH THIS AS FINE A PIPEWEED AS YOU COULD WISH FOR AND QUITE UNSPOILT
GIMLI TOOK SOME AND RUBBED IT IN HIS PALMS AND SNIFFED IT IT FEELS GOOD AND IT SMELLS GOOD HE SAID
IT IS GOOD SAID MERRY MY DEAR GIMLI IT IS LONGBOTTOM LEAF THERE WERE THE HORNBLOWER BRANDMARKS ON THE BARRELS AS PLAIN AS PLAIN HOW IT CAME HERE I CANT IMAGINE FOR SARUMANS PRIVATE USE I FANCY I NEVER KNEW THAT IT WENT SO FAR ABROAD BUT IT COMES IN HANDY NOW
IT WOULD SAID GIMLI IF I HAD A PIPE TO GO WITH IT ALAS I LOST MINE IN MORIA OR BEFORE IS THERE NO PIPE IN ALL YOUR PLUNDER
NO I AM AFRAID NOT SAID MERRY WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY NOT EVEN HERE IN THE GUARDROOMS SARUMAN KEPT THIS DAINTY TO HIMSELF IT SEEMS AND I DONT THINK IT WOULD BE ANY USE KNOCKING ON THE DOORS OF ORTHANC TO BEG A PIPE OF HIM WE SHALL HAVE TO SHARE PIPES AS GOOD FRIENDS MUST AT A PINCH
HALF A MOMENT SAID PIPPIN PUTTING HIS HAND INSIDE THE BREAST OF HIS JACKET HE PULLED OUT A LITTLE SOFT WALLET ON A STRING I KEEP A TREASURE OR TWO NEAR MY SKIN AS PRECIOUS AS RINGS TO ME HERES ONE MY OLD WOODEN PIPE AND HERES ANOTHER AN UNUSED ONE I HAVE CARRIED IT A LONG WAY THOUGH I DONT KNOW WHY I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED TO FIND ANY PIPEWEED ON THE JOURNEY WHEN MY OWN RAN OUT BUT NOW IT COMES IN USEFUL AFTER ALL HE HELD UP A SMALL PIPE WITH A WIDE FLATTENED BOWL AND HANDED IT TO GIMLI DOES THAT SETTLE THE SCORE BETWEEN US HE SAID SETTLE IT CRIED GIMLI MOST NOBLE HOBBIT IT LEAVES ME DEEP IN YOUR DEBT
WELL I AM GOING BACK INTO THE OPEN AIR TO SEE WHAT THE WIND AND SKY ARE DOING SAID LEGOLAS
WE WILL COME WITH YOU SAID ARAGORN
THEY WENT OUT AND SEATED THEMSELVES UPON THE PILED STONES BEFORE THE GATEWAY THEY COULD SEE FAR DOWN INTO THE VALLEY NOW THE MISTS WERE LIFTING AND FLOATING AWAY UPON THE BREEZE
NOW LET US TAKE OUR EASE HERE FOR A LITTLE SAID ARAGORN WE WILL SIT ON THE EDGE OF RUIN AND TALK AS GANDALF SAYS WHILE HE IS BUSY ELSEWHERE I FEEL A WEARINESS SUCH AS I HAVE SELDOM FELT BEFORE HE WRAPPED HIS GREY CLOAK ABOUT HIM HIDING HIS MAILSHIRT AND STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG LEGS THEN HE LAY BACK AND SENT FROM HIS LIPS A THIN STREAM OF SMOKE
LOOK SAID PIPPIN STRIDER THE RANGER HAS COME BACK
HE HAS NEVER BEEN AWAY SAID ARAGORN I AM STRIDER AND DUNADAN TOO AND I BELONG BOTH TO GONDOR AND THE NORTH
THEY SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE AND THE SUN SHONE ON THEM SLANTING INTO THE VALLEY FROM AMONG WHITE CLOUDS HIGH IN THE WEST LEGOLAS LAY STILL LOOKING UP AT THE SUN AND SKY WITH STEADY EYES AND SINGING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AT LAST HE SAT UP COME NOW HE SAID TIME WEARS ON AND THE MISTS ARE BLOWING AWAY OR WOULD IF YOU STRANGE FOLK DID NOT WREATHE YOURSELVES IN SMOKE WHAT OF THE TALE
WELL MY TALE BEGINS WITH WAKING UP IN THE DARK AND FINDING MYSELF ALL STRUNGUP IN AN ORCCAMP SAID PIPPIN LET ME SEE WHAT IS TODAY
THE FIFTH OF MARCH IN THE SHIRERECKONING SAID ARAGORN
PIPPIN MADE SOME CALCULATIONS ON HIS FINGERS ONLY NINE DAYS AGO HE SAID2IT SEEMS A YEAR SINCE WE WERE CAUGHT WELL THOUGH HALF OF IT WAS LIKE A BAD DREAM I RECKON THAT THREE VERY HORRIBLE DAYS FOLLOWED MERRY WILL CORRECT ME IF I FORGET ANYTHING IMPORTANT I AM NOT GOING INTO DETAILS THE WHIPS AND THE FILTH AND STENCH AND ALL THAT IT DOES NOT BEAR REMEMBERING WITH THAT HE PLUNGED INTO AN ACCOUNT OF BOROMIRS LAST FIGHT AND THE ORCMARCH FROM EMYN MUIL TO THE FOREST THE OTHERS NODDED AS THE VARIOUS POINTS WERE FITTED IN WITH THEIR GUESSES
HERE ARE SOME TREASURES THAT YOU LET FALL SAID ARAGORN YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE THEM BACK HE LOOSENED HIS BELT FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK AND TOOK FROM IT THE TWO SHEATHED KNIVES
WELL SAID MERRY I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE THOSE AGAIN I MARKED A FEW ORCS WITH MINE BUT UGLUK TOOK THEM FROM US HOW HE GLARED AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO STAB ME BUT HE THREW THE THINGS AWAY AS IF THEY BURNED HIM
AND HERE ALSO IS YOUR BROOCH PIPPIN SAID ARAGORN I HAVE KEPT IT SAFE FOR IT IS A VERY PRECIOUS THING
I KNOW SAID PIPPIN IT WAS A WRENCH TO LET IT GO BUT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO
NOTHING ELSE ANSWERED ARAGORN ONE WHO CANNOT CAST AWAY A TREASURE AT NEED IS IN FETTERS YOU DID RIGHTLY
THE CUTTING OF THE BANDS ON YOUR WRISTS THAT WAS SMART WORK SAID GIMLI LUCK SERVED YOU THERE BUT YOU SEIZED YOUR CHANCE WITH BOTH HANDS ONE MIGHT SAY
AND SET US A PRETTY RIDDLE SAID LEGOLAS I WONDERED IF YOU HAD GROWN WINGS
UNFORTUNATELY NOT SAID PIPPIN BUT YOU DID NOT KNOW ABOUT GRISHNAKH HE SHUDDERED AND SAID NO MORE LEAVING MERRY TO TELL OF THOSE LAST HORRIBLE MOMENTS THE PAWING HANDS THE HOT BREATH AND THE DREADFUL STRENGTH OF GRISHNAKHS HAIRY ARMS
ALL THIS ABOUT THE ORCS OF BARADDUR LUGBURZ AS THEY CALL IT MAKES ME UNEASY SAID ARAGORN THE DARK LORD ALREADY KNEW TOO MUCH AND HIS SERVANTS ALSO AND GRISHNAKH EVIDENTLY SENT SOME MESSAGE ACROSS THE RIVER AFTER THE QUARREL THE RED EYE WILL BE LOOKING TOWARDS ISENGARD BUT SARUMAN AT ANY RATE IS IN A CLEFT STICK OF HIS OWN CUTTING
YES WHICHEVER SIDE WINS HIS OUTLOOK IS POOR SAID MERRY THINGS BEGAN TO GO ALL WRONG FOR HIM FROM THE MOMENT HIS ORCS SET FOOT IN ROHAN
WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE OLD VILLAIN OR SO GANDALF HINTS SAID GIMLI ON THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
WHEN WAS THAT ASKED PIPPIN
FIVE NIGHTS AGO SAID ARAGORN
LET ME SEE SAID MERRY FIVE NIGHTS AGO  NOW WE COME TO A PART OF THE STORY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WE MET TREEBEARD THAT MORNING AFTER THE BATTLE AND THAT NIGHT WE WERE AT WELLINGHALL ONE OF HIS ENTHOUSES THE NEXT MORNING WE WENT TO ENTMOOT A GATHERING OF ENTS THAT IS AND THE QUEEREST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE IT LASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT AND WE SPENT THE NIGHTS WITH AN ENT CALLED QUICKBEAM AND THEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE THIRD DAY OF THEIR MOOT THE ENTS SUDDENLY BLEW UP IT WAS AMAZING THE FOREST HAD FELT AS TENSE AS IF A THUNDERSTORM WAS BREWING INSIDE IT THEN ALL AT ONCE IT EXPLODED I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HEARD THEIR SONG AS THEY MARCHED
IF SARUMAN HAD HEARD IT HE WOULD BE A HUNDRED MILES AWAY BY NOW EVEN IF HE HAD HAD TO RUN ON HIS OWN LEGS SAID PIPPIN
THOUGH ISENGARD BE STRONG AND HARD AS COLD AS STONE AND BARE AS BONE
WE GO WE GO WE GO TO WAR TO HEW THE STONE AND BREAK THE DOOR

THERE WAS VERY MUCH MORE A GREAT DEAL OF THE SONG HAD NO WORDS AND WAS LIKE A MUSIC OF HORNS AND DRUMS IT WAS VERY EXCITING BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY MARCHING MUSIC AND NO MORE JUST A SONG  UNTIL I GOT HERE I KNOW BETTER NOW
WE CAME DOWN OVER THE LAST RIDGE INTO NAN CURUNIR AFTER NIGHT HAD FALLEN MERRY CONTINUED IT WAS THEN THAT I FIRST HAD THE FEELING THAT THE FOREST ITSELF WAS MOVING BEHIND US I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING AN ENTISH DREAM BUT PIPPIN HAD NOTICED IT TOO WE WERE BOTH FRIGHTENED BUT WE DID NOT FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT UNTIL LATER
IT WAS THE HUORNS OR SO THE ENTS CALL THEM IN SHORT LANGUAGE TREEBEARD WONT SAY MUCH ABOUT THEM BUT I THINK THEY ARE ENTS THAT HAVE BECOME ALMOST LIKE TREES AT LEAST TO LOOK AT THEY STAND HERE AND THERE IN THE WOOD OR UNDER ITS EAVES SILENT WATCHING ENDLESSLY OVER THE TREES BUT DEEP IN THE DARKEST DALES THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM I BELIEVE
THERE IS A GREAT POWER IN THEM AND THEY SEEM ABLE TO WRAP THEMSELVES IN SHADOW IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE THEM MOVING BUT THEY DO THEY CAN MOVE VERY QUICKLY IF THEY ARE ANGRY YOU STAND STILL LOOKING AT THE WEATHER MAYBE OR LISTENING TO THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU FIND THAT YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A WOOD WITH GREAT GROPING TREES ALL AROUND YOU THEY STILL HAVE VOICES AND CAN SPEAK WITH THE ENTS  THAT IS WHY THEY ARE CALLED HUORNS TREEBEARD SAYS  BUT THEY HAVE BECOME QUEER AND WILD DANGEROUS I SHOULD BE TERRIFIED OF MEETING THEM IF THERE WERE NO TRUE ENTS ABOUT TO LOOK AFTER THEM
WELL IN THE EARLY NIGHT WE CREPT DOWN A LONG RAVINE INTO THE UPPER END OF THE WIZARDS VALE THE ENTS WITH ALL THEIR RUSTLING HUORNS BEHIND WE COULD NOT SEE THEM OF COURSE BUT THE WHOLE AIR WAS FULL OF CREAKING IT WAS VERY DARK A CLOUDY NIGHT THEY MOVED AT A GREAT SPEED AS SOON AS THEY HAD LEFT THE HILLS AND MADE A NOISE LIKE A RUSHING WIND THE MOON DID NOT APPEAR THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND NOT LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT THERE WAS A TALL WOOD ALL ROUND THE NORTH SIDE OF ISENGARD THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ENEMIES NOR OF ANY CHALLENGE THERE WAS A LIGHT GLEAMING FROM A HIGH WINDOW IN THE TOWER THAT WAS ALL
TREEBEARD AND A FEW MORE ENTS CREPT ON RIGHT ROUND TO WITHIN SIGHT OF THE GREAT GATES PIPPIN AND I WERE WITH HIM WE WERE SITTING ON TREEBEARDS SHOULDERS AND I COULD FEEL THE QUIVERING TENSENESS IN HIM BUT EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ROUSED ENTS CAN BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND PATIENT THEY STOOD STILL AS CARVED STONES BREATHING AND LISTENING
THEN ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS STIR TRUMPETS BLARED AND THE WALLS OF ISENGARD ECHOED WE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND THAT BATTLE WAS GOING TO BEGIN BUT NOTHING OF THE SORT ALL SARUMANS PEOPLE WERE MARCHING AWAY I DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS WAR OR ABOUT THE HORSEMEN OF ROHAN BUT SARUMAN SEEMS TO HAVE MEANT TO FINISH OFF THE KING AND ALL HIS MEN WITH ONE FINAL BLOW HE EMPTIED ISENGARD I SAW THE ENEMY GO ENDLESS LINES OF MARCHING ORCS AND TROOPS OF THEM MOUNTED ON GREAT WOLVES AND THERE WERE BATTALIONS OF MEN TOO MANY OF THEM CARRIED TORCHES AND IN THE FLARE I COULD SEE THEIR FACES MOST OF THEM WERE ORDINARY MEN RATHER TALL AND DARKHAIRED AND GRIM BUT NOT PARTICULARLY EVILLOOKING BUT THERE WERE SOME OTHERS THAT WERE HORRIBLE MANHIGH BUT WITH GOBLINFACES SALLOW LEERING SQUINTEYED DO YOU KNOW THEY REMINDED ME AT ONCE OF THAT SOUTHERNER AT BREE ONLY HE WAS NOT SO OBVIOUSLY ORCLIKE AS MOST OF THESE WERE
I THOUGHT OF HIM TOO SAID ARAGORN WE HAD MANY OF THESE HALFORCS TO DEAL WITH AT HELMS DEEP IT SEEMS PLAIN NOW THAT THAT SOUTHERNER WAS A SPY OF SARUMANS BUT WHETHER HE WAS WORKING WITH THE BLACK RIDERS OR FOR SARUMAN ALONE I DO NOT KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT WITH THESE EVIL FOLK TO KNOW WHEN THEY ARE IN LEAGUE AND WHEN THEY ARE CHEATING ONE ANOTHER
WELL OF ALL SORTS TOGETHER THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TEN THOUSAND AT THE VERY LEAST SAID MERRY THEY TOOK AN HOUR TO PASS OUT OF THE GATES SOME WENT OFF DOWN THE HIGHWAY TO THE FORDS AND SOME TURNED AWAYAND WENT EASTWARD A BRIDGE HAS BEEN BUILT DOWN THERE ABOUT A MILE AWAY WHERE THE RIVER RUNS IN A VERY DEEP CHANNEL YOU COULD SEE IT NOW IF YOU STOOD UP THEY WERE ALL SINGING WITH HARSH VOICES AND LAUGHING MAKING A HIDEOUS DIN I THOUGHT THINGS LOOKED VERY BLACK FOR ROHAN BUT TREEBEARD DID NOT MOVE HE SAID MY BUSINESS IS WITH ISENGARD TONIGHT WITH ROCK AND STONE
BUT THOUGH I COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE DARK I BELIEVE THAT HUORNS BEGAN TO MOVE SOUTH AS SOON AS THE GATES WERE SHUT AGAIN THEIR BUSINESS WAS WITH ORCS I THINK THEY WERE FAR DOWN THE VALLEY IN THE MORNING OR ANY RATE THERE WAS A SHADOW THERE THAT ONE COULDNT SEE THROUGH
AS SOON AS SARUMAN HAD SENT OFF ALL HIS ARMY OUR TURN CAME TREEBEARD PUT US DOWN AND WENT UP TO THE GATES AND BEGAN HAMMERING ON THE DOORS AND CALLING FOR SARUMAN THERE WAS NO ANSWER EXCEPT ARROWS AND STONES FROM THE WALLS BUT ARROWS ARE NO USE AGAINST ENTS THEY HURT THEM OF COURSE AND INFURIATE THEM LIKE STINGING FLIES BUT AN ENT CAN BE STUCK AS FULL OF ORCARROWS AS A PINCUSHION AND TAKE NO SERIOUS HARM THEY CANNOT BE POISONED FOR ONE THING AND THEIR SKIN SEEMS TO BE VERY THICK AND TOUGHER THAN BARK IT TAKES A VERY HEAVY AXESTROKE TO WOUND THEM SERIOUSLY THEY DONT LIKE AXES BUT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A GREAT MANY AXEMEN TO ONE ENT A MAN THAT HACKS ONCE AT AN ENT NEVER GETS A CHANCE OF A SECOND BLOW A PUNCH FROM AN ENTFIST CRUMPLES UP IRON LIKE THIN TIN
WHEN TREEBEARD HAD GOT A FEW ARROWS IN HIM HE BEGAN TO WARM UP TO GET POSITIVELY HASTY AS HE WOULD SAY HE LET OUT A GREAT HOOMHOM AND A DOZEN MORE ENTS CAME STRIDING UP AN ANGRY ENT IS TERRIFYING THEIR FINGERS AND THEIR TOES JUST FREEZE ON TO ROCK AND THEY TEAR IT UP LIKE BREADCRUST IT WAS LIKE WATCHING THE WORK OF GREAT TREEROOTS IN A HUNDRED YEARS ALL PACKED INTO A FEW MOMENTS
THEY PUSHED PULLED TORE SHOOK AND HAMMERED AND CLANGBANG CRASHCRACK IN FIVE MINUTES THEY HAD THESE HUGE GATES JUST LYING IN RUIN AND SOME WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO EAT INTO THE WALLS LIKE RABBITS IN A SANDPIT I DONT KNOW WHAT SARUMAN THOUGHT WAS HAPPENING BUT ANYWAY HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT HIS WIZARDRY MAY HAVE BEEN FALLING OFF LATELY OF COURSE BUT ANYWAY I THINK HE HAS NOT MUCH GRIT NOT MUCH PLAIN COURAGE ALONE IN A TIGHT PLACE WITHOUT A LOT OF SLAVES AND MACHINES AND THINGS IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN VERY DIFFERENT FROM OLD GANDALF I WONDER IF HIS FAME WAS NOT ALL ALONG MAINLY DUE TO HIS CLEVERNESS IN SETTLING AT ISENGARD
NO SAID ARAGORN ONCE HE WAS AS GREAT AS HIS FAME MADE HIM HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS DEEP HIS THOUGHT WAS SUBTLE AND HIS HANDS MARVELLOUSLY SKILLED AND HE HAD A POWER OVER THE MINDS OF OTHERS THE WISE HE COULD PERSUADE AND THE SMALLER FOLK HE COULD DAUNT THAT POWER HE CERTAINLY STILL KEEPS THERE ARE NOT MANY IN MIDDLEEARTH THAT I SHOULD SAY WERE SAFE IF THEY WERE LEFT ALONE TO TALK WITH HIM EVEN NOW WHEN HE HAS SUFFERED A DEFEAT GANDALF ELROND AND GALADRIEL PERHAPS NOW THAT HIS WICKEDNESS HAS BEEN LAID BARE BUT VERY FEW OTHERS
THE ENTS ARE SAFE SAID PIPPIN HE SEEMS AT ONE TIME TO HAVE GOT ROUND THEM BUT NEVER AGAIN AND ANYWAY HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM AND HE MADE THE GREAT MISTAKE OF LEAVING THEM OUT OF HIS CALCULATIONS HE HAD NO PLAN FOR THEM AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO MAKE ANY ONCE THEY HAD SET TO WORK AS SOON AS OUR ATTACK BEGAN THE FEW REMAINING RATS IN ISENGARD STARTED BOLTING THROUGH EVERY HOLE THAT THE ENTS MADE THE ENTS LET THE MEN GO AFTER THEY HAD QUESTIONED THEM TWO OR THREE DOZEN ONLY DOWN AT THIS END I DONT THINK MANY ORCFOLK OF ANY SIZE ESCAPED NOT FROM THE HUORNS THERE WAS A WOOD FULL OF THEM ALL ROUND ISENGARD BY THAT TIME AS WELL AS THOSE THAT HAD GONE DOWN THE VALLEY
WHEN THE ENTS HAD REDUCED A LARGE PART OF THE SOUTHERN WALLS TO RUBBISH AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS PEOPLE HAD BOLTED AND DESERTED HIM SARUMAN FLED IN A PANIC HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AT THE GATES WHEN WE ARRIVED I EXPECT HE CAME TO WATCH HIS SPLENDID ARMY MARCH OUT WHEN THE ENTS BROKE THEIR WAY IN HE LEFT IN A HURRY THEY DID NOT SPOT HIM AT FIRST BUT THE NIGHT HAD OPENED OUT AND THERE WAS A GREAT LIGHT OF STARS QUITE ENOUGH FOR ENTS TO SEE BY AND SUDDENLY QUICKBEAM GAVE A CRY THE TREEKILLER THE TREEKILLER QUICKBEAM IS A GENTLE CREATURE BUT HE HATES SARUMAN ALL THE MORE FIERCELY FOR THAT HIS PEOPLE SUFFERED CRUELLY FROM ORCAXES HE LEAPT DOWN THE PATH FROM THE INNER GATE AND HE CAN MOVE LIKE A WIND WHEN HE IS ROUSED THERE WAS A PALE FIGURE HURRYING AWAY IN AND OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF THE PILLARS AND IT HAD NEARLY REACHED THE STAIRS TO THE TOWERDOOR BUT IT WAS A NEAR THING QUICKBEAM WAS SO HOT AFTER HIM THAT HE WAS WITHIN A STEP OR TWO OF BEING CAUGHT AND STRANGLED WHEN HE SLIPPED IN THROUGH THE DOOR
WHEN SARUMAN WAS SAFE BACK IN ORTHANC IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE SET SOME OF HIS PRECIOUS MACHINERY TO WORK BY THAT TIME THERE WERE MANY ENTS INSIDE ISENGARD SOME HAD FOLLOWED QUICKBEAM AND OTHERS HAD BURST IN FROM THE NORTH AND EAST THEY WERE ROAMING ABOUT AND DOING A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE SUDDENLY UP CAME FIRES AND FOUL FUMES THE VENTS AND SHAFTS ALL OVER THE PLAIN BEGAN TO SPOUT AND BELCH SEVERAL OF THE ENTS GOT SCORCHED AND BLISTERED ONE OF THEM BEECHBONE I THINK HE WAS CALLED A VERY TALL HANDSOME ENT GOT CAUGHT IN A SPRAY OF SOME LIQUID FIRE AND BURNED LIKE A TORCH A HORRIBLE SIGHT
THAT SENT THEM MAD I THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD BEEN REALLY ROUSED BEFORE BUT I WAS WRONG I SAW WHAT IT WAS LIKE AT LAST IT WAS STAGGERING THEY ROARED AND BOOMED AND TRUMPETED UNTIL STONES BEGAN TO CRACK AND FALL AT THE MERE NOISE OF THEM MERRY AND I LAY ON THE GROUND AND STUFFED OUR CLOAKS INTO OUR EARS ROUND AND ROUND THE ROCK OF ORTHANC THE ENTS WENT STRIDING AND STORMING LIKE A HOWLING GALE BREAKING PILLARS HURLING AVALANCHES OF BOULDERS DOWN THE SHAFTS TOSSING UP HUGE SLABS OF STONE INTO THE AIR LIKE LEAVES THE TOWER WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SPINNING WHIRLWIND I SAW IRON POSTS AND BLOCKS OF MASONRY GO ROCKETING UP HUNDREDS OF FEET AND SMASH AGAINST THE WINDOWS OF ORTHANC BUT TREEBEARD KEPT HIS HEAD HE HAD NOT HAD ANY BURNS LUCKILY HE DID NOT WANT HIS FOLK TO HURT THEMSELVES IN THEIR FURY AND HE DID NOT WANT SARUMAN TO ESCAPE OUT OF SOME HOLE IN THE CONFUSION MANY OF THE ENTS WERE HURLING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE ORTHANCROCK BUT THAT DEFEATED THEM IT IS VERY SMOOTH AND HARD SOME WIZARDRY IS IN IT PERHAPS OLDER AND STRONGER THAN SARUMANS ANYWAY THEY COULD NOT GET A GRIP ON IT OR MAKE A CRACK IN IT AND THEY WERE BRUISING AND WOUNDING THEMSELVES AGAINST IT SO TREEBEARD WENT OUT INTO THE RING AND SHOUTED HIS ENORMOUS VOICE ROSE ABOVE ALL THE DIN THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE SUDDENLY IN IT WE HEARD A SHRILL LAUGH FROM A HIGH WINDOW IN THE TOWER THAT HAD A QUEER EFFECT ON THE ENTS THEY HAD BEEN BOILING OVER NOW THEY BECAME COLD GRIM AS ICE AND QUIET THEY LEFT THE PLAIN AND GATHERED ROUND TREEBEARD STANDING QUITE STILL HE SPOKE TO THEM FOR A LITTLE IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE I THINK HE WAS TELLING THEM OF A PLAN HE HAD MADE IN HIS OLD HEAD LONG BEFORE THEN THEY JUST FADED SILENTLY AWAY IN THE GREY LIGHT DAY WAS DAWNING BY THAT TIME
THEY SET A WATCH ON THE TOWER I BELIEVE BUT THE WATCHERS WERE SO WELL HIDDEN IN SHADOWS AND KEPT SO STILL THAT I COULD NOT SEE THEM THE OTHERS WENT AWAY NORTH ALL THAT DAY THEY WERE BUSY OUT OF SIGHT MOST OF THE TIME WE WERE LEFT ALONE IT WAS A DREARY DAY AND WE WANDERED ABOUT A BIT THOUGH WE KEPT OUT OF THE VIEW OF THE WINDOWS OF ORTHANC AS MUCH AS WE COULD THEY STARED AT US SO THREATENINGLY A GOOD DEAL OF THE TIME WE SPENT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO EAT AND ALSO WE SAT AND TALKED WONDERING WHAT WAS HAPPENING AWAY SOUTH IN ROHAN AND WHAT HAD BECOME OF ALL THE REST OF OUR COMPANY EVERY NOW AND THEN WE COULD HEAR IN THE DISTANCE THE RATTLE AND FALL OF STONE AND THUDDING NOISES ECHOING IN THE HILLS
IN THE AFTERNOON WE WALKED ROUND THE CIRCLE AND WENT TO HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE WAS A GREAT SHADOWY WOOD OF HUORNS AT THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY AND ANOTHER ROUND THE NORTHERN WALL WE DID NOT DARE TO GO IN BUT THERE WAS A RENDING TEARING NOISE OF WORK GOING ON INSIDE ENTS AND HUORNS WERE DIGGING GREAT PITS AND TRENCHES AND MAKING GREAT POOLS AND DAMS GATHERING ALL THE WATERS OF THE ISEN AND EVERY OTHER SPRING AND STREAM THAT THEY COULD FIND WE LEFT THEM TO IT
AT DUSK TREEBEARD CAME BACK TO THE GATE HE WAS HUMMING AND BOOMING TO HIMSELF AND SEEMED PLEASED HE STOOD AND STRETCHED HIS GREAT ARMS AND LEGS AND BREATHED DEEP I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS TIRED
TIRED HE SAID TIRED WELL NO NOT TIRED BUT STIFF I NEED A GOOD DRAUGHT OF ENTWASH WE HAVE WORKED HARD WE HAVE DONE MORE STONECRACKING AND EARTHGNAWING TODAY THAN WE HAVE DONE IN MANY A LONG YEAR BEFORE BUT IT IS NEARLY FINISHED WHEN NIGHT FALLS DO NOT LINGER NEAR THIS GATE OR IN THE OLD TUNNEL WATER MAY COME THROUGH  AND IT WILL BE FOUL WATER FOR A WHILE UNTIL ALL THE FILTH OF SARUMAN IS WASHED AWAY THEN ISEN CAN RUN CLEAN AGAIN HE BEGAN TO PULL DOWN A BIT MORE OF THE WALLS IN A LEISURELY SORT OF WAY JUST TO AMUSE HIMSELF
WE WERE JUST WONDERING WHERE IT WOULD BE SAFE TO LIE AND GET SOME SLEEP WHEN THE MOST AMAZING THING OF ALL HAPPENED THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A RIDER COMING SWIFTLY UP THE ROAD MERRY AND I LAY QUIET AND TREEBEARD HID HIMSELF IN THE SHADOWS UNDER THE ARCH SUDDENLY A GREAT HORSE CAME STRIDING UP LIKE A FLASH OF SILVER IT WAS ALREADY DARK BUT I COULD SEE THE RIDERS FACE CLEARLY IT SEEMED TO SHINE AND ALL HIS CLOTHES WERE WHITE I JUST SAT UP STARING WITH MY MOUTH OPEN I TRIED TO CALL OUT AND COULDNT
THERE WAS NO NEED HE HALTED JUST BY US AND LOOKED DOWN AT US GANDALF I SAID AT LAST BUT MY VOICE WAS ONLY A WHISPER DID HE SAY HULLO PIPPIN THIS IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE NO INDEED HE SAID GET UP YOU TOMFOOL OF A TOOK WHERE IN THE NAME OF WONDER IN ALL THIS RUIN IS TREEBEARD I WANT HIM QUICK
TREEBEARD HEARD HIS VOICE AND CAME OUT OF THE SHADOWS AT ONCE AND THERE WAS A STRANGE MEETING I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM SEEMED SURPRISED AT ALL GANDALF OBVIOUSLY EXPECTED TO FIND TREEBEARD HERE AND TREEBEARD MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN LOITERING ABOUT NEAR THE GATES ON PURPOSE TO MEET HIM YET WE HAD TOLD THE OLD ENT ALL ABOUT MORIA BUT THEN I REMEMBERED A QUEER LOOK HE GAVE US AT THE TIME I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD SEEN GANDALF OR HAD SOME NEWS OF HIM BUT WOULD NOT SAY ANYTHING IN A HURRY DONT BE HASTY IS HIS MOTTO BUT NOBODY NOT EVEN ELVES WILL SAY MUCH ABOUT GANDALFS MOVEMENTS WHEN HE IS NOT THERE
HOOM GANDALF SAID TREEBEARD I AM GLAD YOU HAVE COME WOOD AND WATER STOCK AND STONE I CAN MASTER BUT THERE IS A WIZARD TO MANAGE HERE
TREEBEARD SAID GANDALF I NEED YOUR HELP YOU HAVE DONE MUCH BUT I NEED MORE I HAVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ORCS TO MANAGE
THEN THOSE TWO WENT OFF AND HAD A COUNCIL TOGETHER IN SOME CORNER IT MUST HAVE SEEMED VERY HASTY TO TREEBEARD FOR GANDALF WAS IN A TREMENDOUS HURRY AND WAS ALREADY TALKING AT A GREAT PACE BEFORE THEY PASSED OUT OF HEARING THEY WERE ONLY AWAY A MATTER OF MINUTES PERHAPS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEN GANDALF CAME BACK TO US AND HE SEEMED RELIEVED ALMOST MERRY HE DID SAY HE WAS GLAD TO SEE US THEN
BUT GANDALF I CRIED WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN AND HAVE YOU SEEN THE OTHERS
WHEREVER I HAVE BEEN I AM BACK HE ANSWERED IN THE GENUINE GANDALF MANNER YES I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE OTHERS BUT NEWS MUST WAIT THIS IS A PERILOUS NIGHT AND I MUST RIDE FAST BUT THE DAWN MAY BE BRIGHTER AND IF SO WE SHALL MEET AGAIN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES AND KEEP AWAY FROM ORTHANC GOODBYE
TREEBEARD WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL AFTER GANDALF HAD GONE HE HAD EVIDENTLY LEARNT A LOT IN A SHORT TIME AND WAS DIGESTING IT HE LOOKED AT US AND SAID HM WELL I FIND YOU ARE NOT SUCH HASTY FOLK AS I THOUGHT YOU SAID MUCH LESS THAN YOU MIGHT AND NOT MORE THAN YOU SHOULD HM THIS IS A BUNDLE OF NEWS AND NO MISTAKE WELL NOW TREEBEARD MUST GET BUSY AGAIN
BEFORE HE WENT WE GOT A LITTLE NEWS OUT OF HIM AND IT DID NOT CHEER US UP AT ALL BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE THOUGHT MORE ABOUT YOU THREE THAN ABOUT FRODO AND SAM OR ABOUT POOR BOROMIR FOR WE GATHERED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT BATTLE GOING ON OR SOON WOULD BE AND THAT YOU WERE IN IT AND MIGHT NEVER COME OUT OF IT
HUORNS WILL HELP SAID TREEBEARD THEN HE WENT AWAY AND WE DID NOT SEE HIM AGAIN UNTIL THIS MORNING
IT WAS DEEP NIGHT WE LAY ON TOP OF A PILE OF STONE AND COULD SEE NOTHING BEYOND IT MIST OR SHADOWS BLOTTED OUT EVERYTHING LIKE A GREAT BLANKET ALL ROUND US THE AIR SEEMED HOT AND HEAVY AND IT WAS FULL OF RUSTLINGS CREAKINGS AND A MURMUR LIKE VOICES PASSING I THINK THAT HUNDREDS MORE OF THE HUORNS MUST HAVE BEEN PASSING BY TO HELP IN THE BATTLE LATER THERE WAS A GREAT RUMBLE OF THUNDER AWAY SOUTH AND FLASHES OF LIGHTNING FAR AWAY ACROSS ROHAN EVERY NOW AND THEN WE COULD SEE MOUNTAINPEAKS MILES AND MILES AWAY STAB OUT SUDDENLY BLACK AND WHITE AND THEN VANISH AND BEHIND US THERE WERE NOISES LIKE THUNDER IN HILLS BUT DIFFERENT AT TIMES THE WHOLE VALLEY ECHOED
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ENTS BROKE THE DAMS AND POURED ALL THE GATHERED WATERS THROUGH A GAP IN THE NORTHERN WALL DOWN INTO ISENGARD THE HUORNDARK HAD PASSED AND THE THUNDER HAD ROLLED AWAY THE MOON WAS SINKING BEHIND THE WESTERN MOUNTAINS
ISENGARD BEGAN TO FILL UP WITH BLACK CREEPING STREAMS AND POOLS THEY GLITTERED IN THE LAST LIGHT OF THE MOON AS THEY SPREAD OVER THE PLAIN EVERY NOW AND THEN THE WATERS FOUND THEIR WAY DOWN INTO SOME SHAFT OR SPOUTHOLE GREAT WHITE STEAMS HISSED UP SMOKE ROSE IN BILLOWS THERE WERE EXPLOSIONS AND GUSTS OF FIRE ONE GREAT COIL OF VAPOUR WENT WHIRLING UP TWISTING ROUND AND ROUND ORTHANC UNTIL IT LOOKED LIKE A TALL PEAK OF CLOUD FIERY UNDERNEATH AND MOONLIT ABOVE AND STILL MORE WATER POURED IN UNTIL AT LAST ISENGARD LOOKED LIKE A HUGE FLAT SAUCEPAN ALL STEAMING AND BUBBLING
WE SAW A CLOUD OF SMOKE AND STEAM FROM THE SOUTH LAST NIGHT WHEN WE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF NAN CURUNIR SAID ARAGORN WE FEARED THAT SARUMAN WAS BREWING SOME NEW DEVILRY FOR US
NOT HE SAID PIPPIN HE WAS PROBABLY CHOKING AND NOT LAUGHING ANY MORE BY THE MORNING YESTERDAY MORNING THE WATER HAD SUNK DOWN INTO ALL THE HOLES AND THERE WAS A DENSE FOG WE TOOK REFUGE IN THAT GUARDROOM OVER THERE AND WE HAD RATHER A FRIGHT THE LAKE BEGAN TO OVERFLOW AND POUR OUT THROUGH THE OLD TUNNEL AND THE WATER WAS RAPIDLY RISING UP THE STEPS WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET CAUGHT LIKE ORCS IN A HOLE BUT WE FOUND A WINDING STAIR AT THE BACK OF THE STOREROOM THAT BROUGHT US OUT ON TOP OF THE ARCH IT WAS A SQUEEZE TO GET OUT AS THE PASSAGES HAD BEEN CRACKED AND HALF BLOCKED WITH FALLEN STONE NEAR THE TOP THERE WE SAT HIGH UP ABOVE THE FLOODS AND WATCHED THE DROWNING OF ISENGARD THE ENTS KEPT ON POURING IN MORE WATER TILL ALL THE FIRES WERE QUENCHED AND EVERY CAVE FILLED THE FOGS SLOWLY GATHERED TOGETHER AND STEAMED UP INTO A HUGE UMBRELLA OF CLOUD IT MUST HAVE BEEN A MILE HIGH IN THE EVENING THERE WAS A GREAT RAINBOW OVER THE EASTERN HILLS AND THEN THE SUNSET WAS BLOTTED OUT BY A THICK DRIZZLE ON THE MOUNTAINSIDES IT ALL WENT VERY QUIET A FEW WOLVES HOWLED MOURNFULLY FAR AWAY THE ENTS STOPPED THE INFLOW IN THE NIGHT AND SENT THE ISEN BACK INTO ITS OLD COURSE AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT ALL
SINCE THEN THE WATER HAS BEEN SINKING AGAIN THERE MUST BE OUTLETS SOMEWHERE FROM THE CAVES UNDERNEATH I THINK IF SARUMAN PEEPS OUT OF ANY OF HIS WINDOWS IT MUST LOOK AN UNTIDY DREARY MESS WE FELT VERY LONELY NOT EVEN A VISIBLE ENT TO TALK TO IN ALL THE RUIN AND NO NEWS WE SPENT THE NIGHT UP ON TOP THERE ABOVE THE ARCH AND IT WAS COLD AND DAMP AND WE DID NOT SLEEP WE HAD A FEELING THAT ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN AT ANY MINUTE SARUMAN IS STILL IN HIS TOWER THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE NIGHT LIKE A WIND COMING UP THE VALLEY I THINK THE ENTS AND HUORNS THAT HAD BEEN AWAY CAME BACK THEN BUT WHERE THEY HAVE ALL GONE TO NOW I DONT KNOW IT WAS A MISTY MOISTY MORNING WHEN WE CLIMBED DOWN AND LOOKED ROUND AGAIN AND NOBODY WAS ABOUT AND THAT IS ABOUT ALL THERE IS TO TELL IT SEEMS ALMOST PEACEFUL NOW AFTER ALL THE TURMOIL AND SAFER TOO SOMEHOW SINCE GANDALF CAME BACK I COULD SLEEP
THEY ALL FELL SILENT FOR A WHILE GIMLI REFILLED HIS PIPE THERE IS ONE THING I WONDER ABOUT HE SAID AS HE LIT IT WITH HIS FLINT AND TINDER WORMTONGUE YOU TOLD THEODEN HE WAS WITH SARUMAN HOW DID HE GET THERE
OH YES I FORGOT ABOUT HIM SAID PIPPIN HE DID NOT GET HERE TILL THIS MORNING WE HAD JUST LIT THE FIRE AND HAD SOME BREAKFAST WHEN TREEBEARD APPEARED AGAIN WE HEARD HIM HOOMING AND CALLING OUR NAMES OUTSIDE

HE HAD HARDLY SAID THAT WHEN WE HEARD THE SOUND OF HOOFS ON THE ROAD WE RUSHED OUT BEFORE THE GATES AND I STOOD AND STARED HALF EXPECTING TO SEE STRIDER AND GANDALF COME RIDING UP AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY BUT OUT OF THE MIST THERE RODE A MAN ON AN OLD TIRED HORSE AND HE LOOKED A QUEER TWISTED SORT OF CREATURE HIMSELF THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE MIST AND SUDDENLY SAW ALL THE RUIN AND WRECKAGE IN FRONT OF HIM HE SAT AND GAPED AND HIS FACE WENT ALMOST GREEN HE WAS SO BEWILDERED THAT HE DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE US AT FIRST WHEN HE DID HE GAVE A CRY AND TRIED TO TURN HIS HORSE ROUND AND RIDE OFF BUT TREEBEARD TOOK THREE STRIDES PUT OUT A LONG ARM AND LIFTED HIM OUT OF THE SADDLE HIS HORSE BOLTED IN TERROR AND HE GROVELLED ON THE GROUND HE SAID HE WAS GRIMA FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR OF THE KING AND HAD BEEN SENT WITH IMPORTANT MESSAGES FROM THEODEN TO SARUMAN
NO ONE ELSE WOULD DARE TO RIDE THROUGH THE OPEN LAND SO FULL OF FOUL ORCS HE SAID SO I WAS SENT AND I HAVE HAD A PERILOUS JOURNEY AND I AM HUNGRY AND WEARY I FLED FAR NORTH OUT OF MY WAY PURSUED BY WOLVES
I CAUGHT THE SIDELONG LOOKS HE GAVE TO TREEBEARD AND I SAID TO MYSELF LIAR TREEBEARD LOOKED AT HIM IN HIS LONG SLOW WAY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES TILL THE WRETCHED MAN WAS SQUIRMING ON THE FLOOR THEN AT LAST HE SAID HA HM I WAS EXPECTING YOU MASTER WORMTONGUE THE MAN STARTED AT THAT NAME GANDALF GOT HERE FIRST SO I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT YOU AS I NEED AND I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOU PUT ALL THE RATS IN ONE TRAP SAID GANDALF AND I WILL I AM THE MASTER OF ISENGARD NOW BUT SARUMAN IS LOCKED IN HIS TOWER AND YOU CAN GO THERE AND GIVE HIM ALL THE MESSAGES THAT YOU CAN THINK OF
LET ME GO LET ME GO SAID WORMTONGUE I KNOW THE WAY
YOU KNEW THE WAY I DONT DOUBT SAID TREEBEARD BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED HERE A LITTLE GO AND SEE
HE LET WORMTONGUE GO AND HE LIMPED OFF THROUGH THE ARCH WITH US CLOSE BEHIND UNTIL HE CAME INSIDE THE RING AND COULD SEE ALL THE FLOODS THAT LAY BETWEEN HIM AND ORTHANC THEN HE TURNED TO US
LET ME GO AWAY HE WHINED LET ME GO AWAY MY MESSAGES ARE USELESS NOW
THEY ARE INDEED SAID TREEBEARD BUT YOU HAVE ONLY TWO CHOICES TO STAY WITH ME UNTIL GANDALF AND YOUR MASTER ARRIVE OR TO CROSS THE WATER WHICH WILL YOU HAVE
THE MAN SHIVERED AT THE MENTION OF HIS MASTER AND PUT A FOOT INTO THE WATER BUT HE DREW BACK I CANNOT SWIM HE SAID
THE WATER IS NOT DEEP SAID TREEBEARD IT IS DIRTY BUT THAT WILL NOT HARM YOU MASTER WORMTONGUE IN YOU GO NOW
WITH THAT THE WRETCH FLOUNDERED OFF INTO THE FLOOD IT ROSE UP NEARLY TO HIS NECK BEFORE HE GOT TOO FAR AWAY FOR ME TO SEE HIM THE LAST I SAW OF HIM WAS CLINGING TO SOME OLD BARREL OR PIECE OF WOOD BUT TREEBEARD WADED AFTER HIM AND WATCHED HIS PROGRESS
WELL HE HAS GONE IN HE SAID WHEN HE RETURNED I SAW HIM CRAWLING UP THE STEPS LIKE A DRAGGLED RAT THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE TOWER STILL A HAND CAME OUT AND PULLED HIM IN SO THERE HE IS AND I HOPE THE WELCOME IS TO HIS LIKING NOW I MUST GO AND WASH MYSELF CLEAN OF THE SLIME ILL BE AWAY UP ON THE NORTH SIDE IF ANYONE WANTS TO SEE ME THERE IS NO CLEAN WATER DOWN HERE FIT FOR AN ENT TO DRINK OR TO BATHE IN SO I WILL ASK YOU TWO LADS TO KEEP A WATCH AT THE GATE FOR THE FOLK THAT ARE COMING THERELL BE THE LORD OF THE FIELDS OF ROHAN MARK YOU YOU MUST WELCOME HIM AS WELL AS YOU KNOW HOW HIS MEN HAVE FOUGHT A GREAT FIGHT WITH THE ORCS MAYBE YOU KNOW THE RIGHT FASHION OF MENS WORDS FOR SUCH A LORD BETTER THAN ENTS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY LORDS IN THE GREEN FIELDS IN MY TIME AND I HAVE NEVER LEARNED THEIR SPEECH OR THEIR NAMES THEY WILL BE WANTING MANFOOD AND YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT I GUESS SO FIND WHAT YOU THINK IS FIT FOR A KING TO EAT IF YOU CAN AND THAT IS THE END OF THE STORY THOUGH I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO THIS WORMTONGUE IS WAS HE REALLY THE KINGS COUNSELLOR
HE WAS SAID ARAGORN AND ALSO SARUMANS SPY AND SERVANT IN ROHAN FATE HAS NOT BEEN KINDER TO HIM THAN HE DESERVES THE SIGHT OF THE RUIN OF ALL THAT HE THOUGHT SO STRONG AND MAGNIFICENT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST PUNISHMENT ENOUGH BUT I FEAR THAT WORSE AWAITS HIM
YES I DONT SUPPOSE TREEBEARD SENT HIM TO ORTHANC OUT OF KINDNESS SAID MERRY HE SEEMED RATHER GRIMLY DELIGHTED WITH THE BUSINESS AND WAS LAUGHING TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WENT TO GET HIS BATHE AND DRINK WE SPENT A BUSY TIME AFTER THAT SEARCHING THE FLOTSAM AND RUMMAGING ABOUT WE FOUND TWO OR THREE STOREROOMS IN DIFFERENT PLACES NEARBY ABOVE THE FLOODLEVEL BUT TREEBEARD SENT SOME ENTS DOWN AND THEY CARRIED OFF A GREAT DEAL OF THE STUFF
WE WANT MANFOOD FOR TWENTYFIVE THE ENTS SAID SO YOU CAN SEE THAT SOMEBODY HAD COUNTED YOUR COMPANY CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU ARRIVED YOU THREE WERE EVIDENTLY MEANT TO GO WITH THE GREAT PEOPLE BUT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE FARED ANY BETTER WE KEPT AS GOOD AS WE SENT I PROMISE YOU BETTER BECAUSE WE SENT NO DRINK
WHAT ABOUT DRINK I SAID TO THE ENTS
THERE IS WATER OF ISEN THEY SAID AND THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ENTS AND MEN BUT I HOPE THAT THE ENTS MAY HAVE FOUND TIME TO BREW SOME OF THEIR DRAUGHTS FROM THE MOUNTAINSPRINGS AND WE SHALL SEE GANDALFS BEARD CURLING WHEN HE RETURNS AFTER THE ENTS HAD GONE WE FELT TIRED AND HUNGRY BUT WE DID NOT GRUMBLE  OUR LABOURS HAD BEEN WELL REWARDED IT WAS THROUGH OUR SEARCH FOR MANFOOD THAT PIPPIN DISCOVERED THE PRIZE OF ALL THE FLOTSAM THOSE HORNBLOWER BARRELS PIPEWEED IS BETTER AFTER FOOD SAID PIPPIN THAT IS HOW THE SITUATION AROSE
WE UNDERSTAND IT ALL PERFECTLY NOW SAID GIMLI
ALL EXCEPT ONE THING SAID ARAGORN LEAF FROM THE SOUTHFARTHING IN ISENGARD THE MORE I CONSIDER IT THE MORE CURIOUS I FIND IT I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN ISENGARD BUT I HAVE JOURNEYED IN THIS LAND AND I KNOW WELL THE EMPTY COUNTRIES THAT LIE BETWEEN ROHAN AND THE SHIRE NEITHER GOODS NOR FOLK HAVE PASSED THAT WAY FOR MANY A LONG YEAR NOT OPENLY SARUMAN HAD SECRET DEALINGS WITH SOMEONE IN THE SHIRE I GUESS WORMTONGUES MAY BE FOUND IN OTHER HOUSES THAN KING THEODENS WAS THERE A DATE ON THE BARRELS
YES SAID PIPPIN IT WAS THE 1417 CROP THAT IS LAST YEARS NO THE YEAR BEFORE OF COURSE NOW A GOOD YEAR
AH WELL WHATEVER EVIL WAS AFOOT IS OVER NOW I HOPE OR ELSE IT IS BEYOND OUR REACH AT PRESENT SAID ARAGORN YET I THINK I SHALL MENTION IT TO GANDALF SMALL MATTER THOUGH IT MAY SEEM AMONG HIS GREAT AFFAIRS
I WONDER WHAT HE IS DOING SAID MERRY THE AFTERNOON IS GETTING ON LET US GO AND LOOK ROUND YOU CAN ENTER ISENGARD NOW AT ANY RATE STRIDER IF YOU WANT TO BUT IT IS NOT A VERY CHEERFUL SIGHT



CHAPTER 10
THE VOICE OF SARUMAN

THEY PASSED THROUGH THE RUINED TUNNEL AND STOOD UPON A HEAP OF STONES GAZING AT THE DARK ROCK OF ORTHANC AND ITS MANY WINDOWS A MENACE STILL IN THE DESOLATION THAT LAY ALL ABOUT IT THE WATERS HAD NOW NEARLY ALL SUBSIDED HERE AND THERE GLOOMY POOLS REMAINED COVERED WITH SCUM AND WRECKAGE BUT MOST OF THE WIDE CIRCLE WAS BARE AGAIN A WILDERNESS OF SLIME AND TUMBLED ROCK PITTED WITH BLACKENED HOLES AND DOTTED WITH POSTS AND PILLARS LEANING DRUNKENLY THIS WAY AND THAT AT THE RIM OF THE SHATTERED BOWL THERE LAY VAST MOUNDS AND SLOPES LIKE THE SHINGLES CAST UP BY A GREAT STORM AND BEYOND THEM THE GREEN AND TANGLED VALLEY RAN UP INTO THE LONG RAVINE BETWEEN THE DARK ARMS OF THE MOUNTAINS ACROSS THE WASTE THEY SAW RIDERS PICKING THEIR WAY THEY WERE COMING FROM THE NORTH SIDE AND ALREADY THEY WERE DRAWING NEAR TO ORTHANC
THERE IS GANDALF AND THEODEN AND HIS MEN SAID LEGOLAS LET US GO AND MEET THEM
WALK WARILY SAID MERRY THERE ARE LOOSE SLABS THAT MAY TILT UP AND THROW YOU DOWN INTO A PIT IF YOU DONT TAKE CARE
THEY FOLLOWED WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE ROAD FROM THE GATES TO ORTHANC GOING SLOWLY FOR THE FLAGSTONES WERE CRACKED AND SLIMED THE RIDERS SEEING THEM APPROACH HALTED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE ROCK AND WAITED FOR THEM GANDALF RODE FORWARD TO MEET THEM
WELL TREEBEARD AND I HAVE HAD SOME INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS AND MADE A FEW PLANS HE SAID AND WE HAVE ALL HAD SOME MUCHNEEDED REST NOW WE MUST BE GOING ON AGAIN I HOPE YOU COMPANIONS HAVE ALL RESTED TOO AND REFRESHED YOURSELVES
WE HAVE SAID MERRY BUT OUR DISCUSSIONS BEGAN AND ENDED IN SMOKE STILL WE FEEL LESS ILLDISPOSED TOWARDS SARUMAN THAN WE DID
DO YOU INDEED SAID GANDALF WELL I DO NOT I HAVE NOW A LAST TASK TO DO BEFORE I GO I MUST PAY SARUMAN A FAREWELL VISIT DANGEROUS AND PROBABLY USELESS BUT IT MUST BE DONE THOSE OF YOU WHO WISH MAY COME WITH ME  BUT BEWARE AND DO NOT JEST THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR IT
I WILL COME SAID GIMLI I WISH TO SEE HIM AND LEARN IF HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE YOU
AND HOW WILL YOU LEARN THAT MASTER DWARF SAID GANDALF SARUMAN COULD LOOK LIKE ME IN YOUR EYES IF IT SUITED HIS PURPOSE WITH YOU AND ARE YOU YET WISE ENOUGH TO DETECT ALL HIS COUNTERFEITS WELL WE SHALL SEE PERHAPS HE MAY BE SHY OF SHOWING HIMSELF BEFORE MANY DIFFERENT EYES TOGETHER BUT I HAVE ORDERED ALL THE ENTS TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM SIGHT SO PERHAPS WE SHALL PERSUADE HIM TO COME OUT
WHATS THE DANGER ASKED PIPPIN WILL HE SHOOT AT US AND POUR FIRE OUT OF THE WINDOWS OR CAN HE PUT A SPELL ON US FROM A DISTANCE
THE LAST IS MOST LIKELY IF YOU RIDE TO HIS DOOR WITH A LIGHT HEART SAID GANDALF BUT THERE IS NO KNOWING WHAT HE CAN DO OR MAY CHOOSE TO TRY A WILD BEAST CORNERED IS NOT SAFE TO APPROACH AND SARUMAN HAS POWERS YOU DO NOT GUESS BEWARE OF HIS VOICE
THEY CAME NOW TO THE FOOT OF ORTHANC IT WAS BLACK AND THE ROCK GLEAMED AS IF IT WERE WET THE MANY FACES OF THE STONE HAD SHARP EDGES AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN NEWLY CHISELLED A FEW SCORINGS AND SMALL FLAKELIKE SPLINTERS NEAR THE BASE WERE ALL THE MARKS THAT IT BORE OF THE FURY OF THE ENTS
ON THE EASTERN SIDE IN THE ANGLE OF TWO PIERS THERE WAS A GREAT DOOR HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND AND OVER IT WAS A SHUTTERED WINDOW OPENING UPON A BALCONY HEDGED WITH IRON BARS UP TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR THERE MOUNTED A FLIGHT OF TWENTYSEVEN BROAD STAIRS HEWN BY SOME UNKNOWN ART OF THE SAME BLACK STONE THIS WAS THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE TOWER BUT MANY TALL WINDOWS WERE CUT WITH DEEP EMBRASURES IN THE CLIMBING WALLS FAR UP THEY PEERED LIKE LITTLE EYES IN THE SHEER FACES OF THE HORNS
AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS GANDALF AND THE KING DISMOUNTED I WILL GO UP SAID GANDALF I HAVE BEEN IN ORTHANC AND I KNOW MY PERIL
AND I TOO WILL GO UP SAID THE KING I AM OLD AND FEAR NO PERIL ANY MORE I WISH TO SPEAK WITH THE ENEMY WHO HAS DONE ME SO MUCH WRONG EOMER SHALL COME WITH ME AND SEE THAT MY AGED FEET DO NOT FALTER
AS YOU WILL SAID GANDALF ARAGORN SHALL COME WITH ME LET THE OTHERS AWAIT US AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS THEY WILL HEAR AND SEE ENOUGH IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO HEAR OR SEE
NAY SAID GIMLI LEGOLAS AND I WISH FOR A CLOSER VIEW WE ALONE HERE REPRESENT OUR KINDRED WE ALSO WILL COME BEHIND
COME THEN SAID GANDALF AND WITH THAT HE CLIMBED THE STEPS AND THEODEN WENT BESIDE HIM
THE RIDERS OF ROHAN SAT UNEASILY UPON THEIR HORSES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE STAIR AND LOOKED UP DARKLY AT THE GREAT TOWER FEARING WHAT MIGHT BEFALL THEIR LORD MERRY AND PIPPIN SAT ON THE BOTTOM STEP FEELING BOTH UNIMPORTANT AND UNSAFE
HALF A STICKY MILE FROM HERE TO THE GATE MUTTERED PIPPIN I WISH I COULD SLIP OFF BACK TO THE GUARDROOM UNNOTICED WHAT DID WE COME FOR WE ARE NOT WANTED
GANDALF STOOD BEFORE THE DOOR OF ORTHANC AND BEAT ON IT WITH HIS STAFF IT RANG WITH A HOLLOW SOUND SARUMAN SARUMAN HE CRIED IN A LOUD COMMANDING VOICE SARUMAN COME FORTH
FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS NO ANSWER AT LAST THE WINDOW ABOVE THE DOOR WAS UNBARRED BUT NO FIGURE COULD BE SEEN AT ITS DARK OPENING
WHO IS IT SAID A VOICE WHAT DO YOU WISH
THEODEN STARTED I KNOW THAT VOICE HE SAID AND I CURSE THE DAY WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO IT
GO AND FETCH SARUMAN SINCE YOU HAVE BECOME HIS FOOTMAN GRIMA WORMTONGUE SAID GANDALF AND DO NOT WASTE OUR TIME
THE WINDOW CLOSED THEY WAITED SUDDENLY ANOTHER VOICE SPOKE LOW AND MELODIOUS ITS VERY SOUND AN ENCHANTMENT THOSE WHO LISTENED UNWARILY TO THAT VOICE COULD SELDOM REPORT THE WORDS THAT THEY HEARD AND IF THEY DID THEY WONDERED FOR LITTLE POWER REMAINED IN THEM MOSTLY THEY REMEMBERED ONLY THAT IT WAS A DELIGHT TO HEAR THE VOICE SPEAKING ALL THAT IT SAID SEEMED WISE AND REASONABLE AND DESIRE AWOKE IN THEM BY SWIFT AGREEMENT TO SEEM WISE THEMSELVES WHEN OTHERS SPOKE THEY SEEMED HARSH AND UNCOUTH BY CONTRAST AND IF THEY GAINSAID THE VOICE ANGER WAS KINDLED IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE UNDER THE SPELL FOR SOME THE SPELL LASTED ONLY WHILE THE VOICE SPOKE TO THEM AND WHEN IT SPAKE TO ANOTHER THEY SMILED AS MEN DO WHO SEE THROUGH A JUGGLERS TRICK WHILE OTHERS GAPE AT IT FOR MANY THE SOUND OF THE VOICE ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM ENTHRALLED BUT FOR THOSE WHOM IT CONQUERED THE SPELL ENDURED WHEN THEY WERE FAR AWAY AND EVER THEY HEARD THAT SOFT VOICE WHISPERING AND URGING THEM BUT NONE WERE UNMOVED NONE REJECTED ITS PLEAS AND ITS COMMANDS WITHOUT AN EFFORT OF MIND AND WILL SO LONG AS ITS MASTER HAD CONTROL OF IT
WELL IT SAID NOW WITH GENTLE QUESTION WHY MUST YOU DISTURB MY REST WILL YOU GIVE ME NO PEACE AT ALL BY NIGHT OR DAY ITS TONE WAS THAT OF A KINDLY HEART AGGRIEVED BY INJURIES UNDESERVED
THEY LOOKED UP ASTONISHED FOR THEY HAD HEARD NO SOUND OF HIS COMING AND THEY SAW A FIGURE STANDING AT THE RAIL LOOKING DOWN UPON THEM AN OLD MAN SWATHED IN A GREAT CLOAK THE COLOUR OF WHICH WAS NOT EASY TO TELL FOR IT CHANGED IF THEY MOVED THEIR EYES OR IF HE STIRRED HIS FACE WAS LONG WITH A HIGH FOREHEAD HE HAD DEEP DARKLING EYES HARD TO FATHOM THOUGH THE LOOK THAT THEY NOW BORE WAS GRAVE AND BENEVOLENT AND A LITTLE WEARY HIS HAIR AND BEARD WERE WHITE BUT STRANDS OF BLACK STILL SHOWED ABOUT HIS LIPS AND EARS
LIKE AND YET UNLIKE MUTTERED GIMLI
BUT COME NOW SAID THE SOFT VOICE TWO AT LEAST OF YOU I KNOW BY NAME GANDALF I KNOW TOO WELL TO HAVE MUCH HOPE THAT HE SEEKS HELP OR COUNSEL HERE BUT YOU THEODEN LORD OF THE MARK OF ROHAN ARE DECLARED BY YOUR NOBLE DEVICES AND STILL MORE BY THE FAIR COUNTENANCE OF THE HOUSE OF EORL O WORTHY SON OF THENGEL THE THRICERENOWNED WHY HAVE YOU NOT COME BEFORE AND AS A FRIEND MUCH HAVE I DESIRED TO SEE YOU MIGHTIEST KING OF WESTERN LANDS AND ESPECIALLY IN THESE LATTER YEARS TO SAVE YOU FROM THE UNWISE AND EVIL COUNSELS THAT BESET YOU IS IT YET TOO LATE DESPITE THE INJURIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE TO ME IN WHICH THE MEN OF ROHAN ALAS HAVE HAD SOME PART STILL I WOULD SAVE YOU AND DELIVER YOU FROM THE RUIN THAT DRAWS NIGH INEVITABLY IF YOU RIDE UPON THIS ROAD WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN INDEED I ALONE CAN AID YOU NOW
THEODEN OPENED HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK BUT HE SAID NOTHING HE LOOKED UP AT THE FACE OF SARUMAN WITH ITS DARK SOLEMN EYES BENT DOWN UPON HIM AND THEN TO GANDALF AT HIS SIDE AND HE SEEMED TO HESITATE GANDALF MADE NO SIGN BUT STOOD SILENT AS STONE AS ONE WAITING PATIENTLY FOR SOME CALL THAT HAS NOT YET COME THE RIDERS STIRRED AT FIRST MURMURING WITH APPROVAL OF THE WORDS OF SARUMAN AND THEN THEY TOO WERE SILENT AS MEN SPELLBOUND IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT GANDALF HAD NEVER SPOKEN SO FAIR AND FITTINGLY TO THEIR LORD ROUGH AND PROUD NOW SEEMED ALL HIS DEALINGS WITH THEODEN AND OVER THEIR HEARTS CREPT A SHADOW THE FEAR OF A GREAT DANGER THE END OF THE MARK IN A DARKNESS TO WHICH GANDALF WAS DRIVING THEM WHILE SARUMAN STOOD BESIDE A DOOR OF ESCAPE HOLDING IT HALF OPEN SO THAT A RAY OF LIGHT CAME THROUGH THERE WAS A HEAVY SILENCE
IT WAS GIMLI THE DWARF WHO BROKE IN SUDDENLY THE WORDS OF THIS WIZARD STAND ON THEIR HEADS HE GROWLED GRIPPING THE HANDLE OF HIS AXE IN THE LANGUAGE OF ORTHANC HELP MEANS RUIN AND SAVING MEANS SLAYING THAT IS PLAIN BUT WE DO NOT COME HERE TO BEG
PEACE SAID SARUMAN AND FOR A FLEETING MOMENT HIS VOICE WAS LESS SUAVE AND A LIGHT FLICKERED IN HIS EYES AND WAS GONE I DO NOT SPEAK TO YOU YET GIMLI GLOINS SON HE SAID FAR AWAY IS YOUR HOME AND SMALL CONCERN OF YOURS ARE THE TROUBLES OF THIS LAND BUT IT WAS NOT BY DESIGN OF YOUR OWN THAT YOU BECAME EMBROILED IN THEM AND SO I WILL NOT BLAME SUCH PART AS YOU HAVE PLAYED  A VALIANT ONE I DOUBT NOT BUT I PRAY YOU ALLOW ME FIRST TO SPEAK WITH THE KING OF ROHAN MY NEIGHBOUR AND ONCE MY FRIEND
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY THEODEN KING WILL YOU HAVE PEACE WITH ME AND ALL THE AID THAT MY KNOWLEDGE FOUNDED IN LONG YEARS CAN BRING SHALL WE MAKE OUR COUNSELS TOGETHER AGAINST EVIL DAYS AND REPAIR OUR INJURIES WITH SUCH GOOD WILL THAT OUR ESTATES SHALL BOTH COME TO FAIRER FLOWER THAN EVER BEFORE
STILL THEODEN DID NOT ANSWER WHETHER HE STROVE WITH ANGER OR DOUBT NONE COULD SAY EOMER SPOKE
LORD HEAR ME HE SAID NOW WE FEEL THE PERIL THAT WE WERE WARNED OF HAVE WE RIDDEN FORTH TO VICTORY ONLY TO STAND AT LAST AMAZED BY AN OLD LIAR WITH HONEY ON HIS FORKED TONGUE SO WOULD THE TRAPPED WOLF SPEAK TO THE HOUNDS IF HE COULD WHAT AID CAN HE GIVE TO YOU FORSOOTH ALL HE DESIRES IS TO ESCAPE FROM HIS PLIGHT BUT WILL YOU PARLEY WITH THIS DEALER IN TREACHERY AND MURDER REMEMBER THEODRED AT THE FORDS AND THE GRAVE OF HAMA IN HELMS DEEP
IF WE SPEAK OF POISONED TONGUES WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF YOURS YOUNG SERPENT SAID SARUMAN AND THE FLASH OF HIS ANGER WAS NOW PLAIN TO SEE BUT COME EOMER EOMUNDS SON HE WENT ON IN HIS SOFT VOICE AGAIN TO EVERY MAN HIS PART VALOUR IN ARMS IS YOURS AND YOU WIN HIGH HONOUR THEREBY SLAY WHOM YOUR LORD NAMES AS ENEMIES AND BE CONTENT MEDDLE NOT IN POLICIES WHICH YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND BUT MAYBE IF YOU BECOME A KING YOU WILL FIND THAT HE MUST CHOOSE HIS FRIENDS WITH CARE THE FRIENDSHIP OF SARUMAN AND THE POWER OF ORTHANC CANNOT BE LIGHTLY THROWN ASIDE WHATEVER GRIEVANCES REAL OR FANCIED MAY LIE BEHIND YOU HAVE WON A BATTLE BUT NOT A WAR AND THAT WITH HELP ON WHICH YOU CANNOT COUNT AGAIN YOU MAY FIND THE SHADOW OF THE WOOD AT YOUR OWN DOOR NEXT IT IS WAYWARD AND SENSELESS AND HAS NO LOVE FOR MEN
BUT MY LORD OF ROHAN AM I TO BE CALLED A MURDERER BECAUSE VALIANT MEN HAVE FALLEN IN BATTLE IF YOU GO TO WAR NEEDLESSLY FOR I DID NOT DESIRE IT THEN MEN WILL BE SLAIN BUT IF I AM A MURDERER ON THAT ACCOUNT THEN ALL THE HOUSE OF EORL IS STAINED WITH MURDER FOR THEY HAVE FOUGHT MANY WARS AND ASSAILED MANY WHO DEFIED THEM YET WITH SOME THEY HAVE AFTERWARDS MADE PEACE NONE THE WORSE FOR BEING POLITIC I SAY THEODEN KING SHALL WE HAVE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP YOU AND I IT IS OURS TO COMMAND
WE WILL HAVE PEACE SAID THEODEN AT LAST THICKLY AND WITH AN EFFORT SEVERAL OF THE RIDERS CRIED OUT GLADLY THEODEN HELD UP HIS HAND YES WE WILL HAVE PEACE HE SAID NOW IN A CLEAR VOICE WE WILL HAVE PEACE WHEN YOU AND ALL YOUR WORKS HAVE PERISHED  AND THE WORKS OF YOUR DARK MASTER TO WHOM YOU WOULD DELIVER US YOU ARE A LIAR SARUMAN AND A CORRUPTER OF MENS HEARTS YOU HOLD OUT YOUR HAND TO ME AND I PERCEIVE ONLY A FINGER OF THE CLAW OF MORDOR CRUEL AND COLD EVEN IF YOUR WAR ON ME WAS JUST AS IT WAS NOT FOR WERE YOU TEN TIMES AS WISE YOU WOULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO RULE ME AND MINE FOR YOUR OWN PROFIT AS YOU DESIRED  EVEN SO WHAT WILL YOU SAY OF YOUR TORCHES IN WESTFOLD AND THE CHILDREN THAT LIE DEAD THERE AND THEY HEWED HAMAS BODY BEFORE THE GATES OF THE HORNBURG AFTER HE WAS DEAD WHEN YOU HANG FROM A GIBBET AT YOUR WINDOW FOR THE SPORT OF YOUR OWN CROWS I WILL HAVE PEACE WITH YOU AND ORTHANC SO MUCH FOR THE HOUSE OF EORL A LESSER SON OF GREAT SIRES AM I BUT I DO NOT NEED TO LICK YOUR FINGERS TURN ELSEWHITHER BUT I FEAR YOUR VOICE HAS LOST ITS CHARM
THE RIDERS GAZED UP AT THEODEN LIKE MEN STARTLED OUT OF A DREAM HARSH AS AN OLD RAVENS THEIR MASTERS VOICE SOUNDED IN THEIR EARS AFTER THE MUSIC OF SARUMAN BUT SARUMAN FOR A WHILE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH WRATH HE LEANED OVER THE RAIL AS IF HE WOULD SMITE THE KING WITH HIS STAFF TO SOME SUDDENLY IT SEEMED THAT THEY SAW A SNAKE COILING ITSELF TO STRIKE
GIBBETS AND CROWS HE HISSED AND THEY SHUDDERED AT THE HIDEOUS CHANGE DOTARD WHAT IS THE HOUSE OF EORL BUT A THATCHED BARN WHERE BRIGANDS DRINK IN THE REEK AND THEIR BRATS ROLL ON THE FLOOR AMONG THE DOGS TOO LONG HAVE THEY ESCAPED THE GIBBET THEMSELVES BUT THE NOOSE COMES SLOW IN THE DRAWING TIGHT AND HARD IN THE END HANG IF YOU WILL NOW HIS VOICE CHANGED AS HE SLOWLY MASTERED HIMSELF I KNOW NOT WHY I HAVE HAD THE PATIENCE TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR I NEED YOU NOT NOR YOUR LITTLE BAND OF GALLOPERS AS SWIFT TO FLY AS TO ADVANCE THEODEN HORSEMASTER LONG AGO I OFFERED YOU A STATE BEYOND YOUR MERIT AND YOUR WIT I HAVE OFFERED IT AGAIN SO THAT THOSE WHOM YOU MISLEAD MAY CLEARLY SEE THE CHOICE OF ROADS YOU GIVE ME BRAG AND ABUSE SO BE IT GO BACK TO YOUR HUTS
BUT YOU GANDALF FOR YOU AT LEAST I AM GRIEVED FEELING FOR YOUR SHAME HOW COMES IT THAT YOU CAN ENDURE SUCH COMPANY FOR YOU ARE PROUD GANDALF  AND NOT WITHOUT REASON HAVING A NOBLE MIND AND EYES THAT LOOK BOTH DEEP AND FAR EVEN NOW WILL YOU NOT LISTEN TO MY COUNSEL
GANDALF STIRRED AND LOOKED UP WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY THAT YOU DID NOT SAY AT OUR LAST MEETING HE ASKED OR PERHAPS YOU HAVE THINGS TO UNSAY
SARUMAN PAUSED UNSAY HE MUSED AS IF PUZZLED UNSAY I ENDEAVOURED TO ADVISE YOU FOR YOUR OWN GOOD BUT YOU SCARCELY LISTENED YOU ARE PROUD AND DO NOT LOVE ADVICE HAVING INDEED A STORE OF YOUR OWN WISDOM BUT ON THAT OCCASION YOU ERRED I THINK MISCONSTRUING MY INTENTIONS WILFULLY I FEAR THAT IN MY EAGERNESS TO PERSUADE YOU I LOST PATIENCE AND INDEED I REGRET IT FOR I BORE YOU NO ILLWILL AND EVEN NOW I BEAR NONE THOUGH YOU RETURN TO ME IN THE COMPANY OF THE VIOLENT AND THE IGNORANT HOW SHOULD I ARE WE NOT BOTH MEMBERS OF A HIGH AND ANCIENT ORDER MOST EXCELLENT IN MIDDLEEARTH OUR FRIENDSHIP WOULD PROFIT US BOTH ALIKE MUCH WE COULD STILL ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER TO HEAL THE DISORDERS OF THE WORLD LET US UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER AND DISMISS FROM THOUGHT THESE LESSER FOLK LET THEM WAIT ON OUR DECISIONS FOR THE COMMON GOOD I AM WILLING TO REDRESS THE PAST AND TO RECEIVE YOU WILL YOU NOT CONSULT WITH ME WILL YOU NOT COME UP
SO GREAT WAS THE POWER THAT SARUMAN EXERTED IN THIS LAST EFFORT THAT NONE THAT STOOD WITHIN HEARING WERE UNMOVED BUT NOW THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY DIFFERENT THEY HEARD THE GENTLE REMONSTRANCE OF A KINDLY KING WITH AN ERRING BUT MUCHLOVED MINISTER BUT THEY WERE SHUT OUT LISTENING AT A DOOR TO WORDS NOT MEANT FOR THEM ILLMANNERED CHILDREN OR STUPID SERVANTS OVERHEARING THE ELUSIVE DISCOURSE OF THEIR ELDERS AND WONDERING HOW IT WOULD AFFECT THEIR LOT OF LOFTIER MOULD THESE TWO WERE MADE REVEREND AND WISE IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE ALLIANCE GANDALF WOULD ASCEND INTO THE TOWER TO DISCUSS DEEP THINGS BEYOND THEIR COMPREHENSION IN THE HIGH CHAMBERS OF ORTHANC THE DOOR WOULD BE CLOSED AND THEY WOULD BE LEFT OUTSIDE DISMISSED TO AWAIT ALLOTTED WORK OR PUNISHMENT EVEN IN THE MIND OF THEODEN THE THOUGHT TOOK SHAPE LIKE A SHADOW OF DOUBT HE WILL BETRAY US HE WILL GO  WE SHALL BE LOST
THEN GANDALF LAUGHED THE FANTASY VANISHED LIKE A PUFF OF SMOKE
SARUMAN SARUMAN SAID GANDALF STILL LAUGHING SARUMAN YOU MISSED YOUR PATH IN LIFE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE KINGS JESTER AND EARNED YOUR BREAD AND STRIPES TOO BY MIMICKING HIS COUNSELLORS AH ME HE PAUSED GETTING THE BETTER OF HIS MIRTH UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER I FEAR I AM BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION BUT YOU SARUMAN I UNDERSTAND NOW TOO WELL I KEEP A CLEARER MEMORY OF YOUR ARGUMENTS AND DEEDS THAN YOU SUPPOSE WHEN LAST I VISITED YOU YOU WERE THE JAILOR OF MORDOR AND THERE I WAS TO BE SENT NAY THE GUEST WHO HAS ESCAPED FROM THE ROOF WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE HE COMES BACK IN BY THE DOOR NAY I DO NOT THINK I WILL COME UP BUT LISTEN SARUMAN FOR THE LAST TIME WILL YOU NOT COME DOWN ISENGARD HAS PROVED LESS STRONG THAN YOUR HOPE AND FANCY MADE IT SO MAY OTHER THINGS IN WHICH YOU STILL HAVE TRUST WOULD IT NOT BE WELL TO LEAVE IT FOR A WHILE TO TURN TO NEW THINGS PERHAPS THINK WELL SARUMAN WILL YOU NOT COME DOWN
A SHADOW PASSED OVER SARUMANS FACE THEN IT WENT DEATHLY WHITE BEFORE HE COULD CONCEAL IT THEY SAW THROUGH THE MASK THE ANGUISH OF A MIND IN DOUBT LOATHING TO STAY AND DREADING TO LEAVE ITS REFUGE FOR A SECOND HE HESITATED AND NO ONE BREATHED THEN HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS SHRILL AND COLD PRIDE AND HATE WERE CONQUERING HIM
WILL I COME DOWN HE MOCKED DOES AN UNARMED MAN COME DOWN TO SPEAK WITH ROBBERS OUT OF DOORS I CAN HEAR YOU WELL ENOUGH HERE I AM NO FOOL AND I DO NOT TRUST YOU GANDALF THEY DO NOT STAND OPENLY ON MY STAIRS BUT I KNOW WHERE THE WILD WOODDEMONS ARE LURKING AT YOUR COMMAND
THE TREACHEROUS ARE EVER DISTRUSTFUL ANSWERED GANDALF WEARILY BUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR FOR YOUR SKIN I DO NOT WISH TO KILL YOU OR HURT YOU AS YOU WOULD KNOW IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTOOD ME AND I HAVE THE POWER TO PROTECT YOU I AM GIVING YOU A LAST CHANCE YOU CAN LEAVE ORTHANC FREE  IF YOU CHOOSE
THAT SOUNDS WELL SNEERED SARUMAN VERY MUCH IN THE MANNER OF GANDALF THE GREY SO CONDESCENDING AND SO VERY KIND I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD FIND ORTHANC COMMODIOUS AND MY DEPARTURE CONVENIENT BUT WHY SHOULD I WISH TO LEAVE AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FREE THERE ARE CONDITIONS I PRESUME
REASONS FOR LEAVING YOU CAN SEE FROM YOUR WINDOWS ANSWERED GANDALF OTHERS WILL OCCUR TO YOUR THOUGHT YOUR SERVANTS ARE DESTROYED AND SCATTERED YOUR NEIGHBOURS YOU HAVE MADE YOUR ENEMIES AND YOU HAVE CHEATED YOUR NEW MASTER OR TRIED TO DO SO WHEN HIS EYE TURNS HITHER IT WILL BE THE RED EYE OF WRATH BUT WHEN I SAY FREE I MEAN FREE FREE FROM BOND OF CHAIN OR COMMAND TO GO WHERE YOU WILL EVEN EVEN TO MORDOR SARUMAN IF YOU DESIRE BUT YOU WILL FIRST SURRENDER TO ME THE KEY OF ORTHANC AND YOUR STAFF THEY SHALL BE PLEDGES OF YOUR CONDUCT TO BE RETURNED LATER IF YOU MERIT THEM
SARUMANS FACE GREW LIVID TWISTED WITH RAGE AND A RED LIGHT WAS KINDLED IN HIS EYES HE LAUGHED WILDLY LATER HE CRIED AND HIS VOICE ROSE TO A SCREAM LATER YES WHEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE KEYS OF BARADDUR ITSELF I SUPPOSE AND THE CROWNS OF SEVEN KINGS AND THE RODS OF THE FIVE WIZARDS AND HAVE PURCHASED YOURSELF A PAIR OF BOOTS MANY SIZES LARGER THAN THOSE THAT YOU WEAR NOW A MODEST PLAN HARDLY ONE IN WHICH MY HELP IS NEEDED I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO DO NOT BE A FOOL IF YOU WISH TO TREAT WITH ME WHILE YOU HAVE A CHANCE GO AWAY AND COME BACK WHEN YOU ARE SOBER AND LEAVE BEHIND THESE CUTTHROATS AND SMALL RAGTAG THAT DANGLE AT YOUR TAIL GOOD DAY HE TURNED AND LEFT THE BALCONY
COME BACK SARUMAN SAID GANDALF IN A COMMANDING VOICE TO THE AMAZEMENT OF THE OTHERS SARUMAN TURNED AGAIN AND AS IF DRAGGED AGAINST HIS WILL HE CAME SLOWLY BACK TO THE IRON RAIL LEANING ON IT BREATHING HARD HIS FACE WAS LINED AND SHRUNKEN HIS HAND CLUTCHED HIS HEAVY BLACK STAFF LIKE A CLAW
I DID NOT GIVE YOU LEAVE TO GO SAID GANDALF STERNLY I HAVE NOT FINISHED YOU HAVE BECOME A FOOL SARUMAN AND YET PITIABLE YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE TURNED AWAY FROM FOLLY AND EVIL AND HAVE BEEN OF SERVICE BUT YOU CHOOSE TO STAY AND GNAW THE ENDS OF YOUR OLD PLOTS STAY THEN BUT I WARN YOU YOU WILL NOT EASILY COME OUT AGAIN NOT UNLESS THE DARK HANDS OF THE EAST STRETCH OUT TO TAKE YOU SARUMAN HE CRIED AND HIS VOICE GREW IN POWER AND AUTHORITY BEHOLD I AM NOT GANDALF THE GREY WHOM YOU BETRAYED I AM GANDALF THE WHITE WHO HAS RETURNED FROM DEATH YOU HAVE NO COLOUR NOW AND I CAST YOU FROM THE ORDER AND FROM THE COUNCIL
HE RAISED HIS HAND AND SPOKE SLOWLY IN A CLEAR COLD VOICE SARUMAN YOUR STAFF IS BROKEN THERE WAS A CRACK AND THE STAFF SPLIT ASUNDER IN SARUMANS HAND AND THE HEAD OF IT FELL DOWN AT GANDALFS FEET GO SAID GANDALF WITH A CRY SARUMAN FELL BACK AND CRAWLED AWAY AT THAT MOMENT A HEAVY SHINING THING CAME HURTLING DOWN FROM ABOVE IT GLANCED OFF THE IRON RAIL EVEN AS SARUMAN LEFT IT AND PASSING CLOSE TO GANDALFS HEAD IT SMOTE THE STAIR ON WHICH HE STOOD THE RAIL RANG AND SNAPPED THE STAIR CRACKED AND SPLINTERED IN GLITTERING SPARKS BUT THE BALL WAS UNHARMED IT ROLLED ON DOWN THE STEPS A GLOBE OF CRYSTAL DARK BUT GLOWING WITH A HEART OF FIRE AS IT BOUNDED AWAY TOWARDS A POOL PIPPIN RAN AFTER IT AND PICKED IT UP
THE MURDEROUS ROGUE CRIED EOMER BUT GANDALF WAS UNMOVED NO THAT WAS NOT THROWN BY SARUMAN HE SAID NOR EVEN AT HIS BIDDING I THINK IT CAME FROM A WINDOW FAR ABOVE A PARTING SHOT FROM MASTER WORMTONGUE I FANCY BUT ILL AIMED
THE AIM WAS POOR MAYBE BECAUSE HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND WHICH HE HATED MORE YOU OR SARUMAN SAID ARAGORN
THAT MAY BE SO SAID GANDALF SMALL COMFORT WILL THOSE TWO HAVE IN THEIR COMPANIONSHIP THEY WILL GNAW ONE ANOTHER WITH WORDS BUT THE PUNISHMENT IS JUST IF WORMTONGUE EVER COMES OUT OF ORTHANC ALIVE IT WILL BE MORE THAN HE DESERVES
HERE MY LAD ILL TAKE THAT I DID NOT ASK YOU TO HANDLE IT HE CRIED TURNING SHARPLY AND SEEING PIPPIN COMING UP THE STEPS SLOWLY AS IF HE WERE BEARING A GREAT WEIGHT HE WENT DOWN TO MEET HIM AND HASTILY TOOK THE DARK GLOBE FROM THE HOBBIT WRAPPING IT IN THE FOLDS OF HIS CLOAK I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS HE SAID IT IS NOT A THING I GUESS THAT SARUMAN WOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO CAST AWAY
BUT HE MAY HAVE OTHER THINGS TO CAST SAID GIMLI IF THAT IS THE END OF THE DEBATE LET US GO OUT OF STONES THROW AT LEAST
IT IS THE END SAID GANDALF LET US GO
THEY TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE DOORS OF ORTHANC AND WENT DOWN THE RIDERS HAILED THE KING WITH JOY AND SALUTED GANDALF THE SPELL OF SARUMAN WAS BROKEN THEY HAD SEEN HIM COME AT CALL AND CRAWL AWAY DISMISSED
WELL THAT IS DONE SAID GANDALF NOW I MUST FIND TREEBEARD AND TELL HIM HOW THINGS HAVE GONE
HE WILL HAVE GUESSED SURELY SAID MERRY WERE THEY LIKELY TO END ANY OTHER WAY
NOT LIKELY ANSWERED GANDALF THOUGH THEY CAME TO THE BALANCE OF A HAIR BUT I HAD REASONS FOR TRYING SOME MERCIFUL AND SOME LESS SO FIRST SARUMAN WAS SHOWN THAT THE POWER OF HIS VOICE WAS WANING HE CANNOT BE BOTH TYRANT AND COUNSELLOR WHEN THE PLOT IS RIPE IT REMAINS NO LONGER SECRET YET HE FELL INTO THE TRAP AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH HIS VICTIMS PIECEMEAL WHILE OTHERS LISTENED THEN I GAVE HIM A LAST CHOICE AND A FAIR ONE TO RENOUNCE BOTH MORDOR AND HIS PRIVATE SCHEMES AND MAKE AMENDS BY HELPING US IN OUR NEED HE KNOWS OUR NEED NONE BETTER GREAT SERVICE HE COULD HAVE RENDERED BUT HE HAS CHOSEN TO WITHHOLD IT AND KEEP THE POWER OF ORTHANC HE WILL NOT SERVE ONLY COMMAND HE LIVES NOW IN TERROR OF THE SHADOW OF MORDOR AND YET HE STILL DREAMS OF RIDING THE STORM UNHAPPY FOOL HE WILL BE DEVOURED IF THE POWER OF THE EAST STRETCHES OUT ITS ARMS TO ISENGARD WE CANNOT DESTROY ORTHANC FROM WITHOUT BUT SAURON  WHO KNOWS WHAT HE CAN DO
AND WHAT IF SAURON DOES NOT CONQUER WHAT WILL YOU DO TO HIM ASKED PIPPIN
I NOTHING SAID GANDALF I WILL DO NOTHING TO HIM I DO NOT WISH FOR MASTERY WHAT WILL BECOME OF HIM I CANNOT SAY I GRIEVE THAT SO MUCH THAT WAS GOOD NOW FESTERS IN THE TOWER STILL FOR US THINGS HAVE NOT GONE BADLY STRANGE ARE THE TURNS OF FORTUNE OFTEN DOES HATRED HURT ITSELF I GUESS THAT EVEN IF WE HAD ENTERED IN WE COULD HAVE FOUND FEW TREASURES IN ORTHANC MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE THING WHICH WORMTONGUE THREW DOWN AT US
A SHRILL SHRIEK SUDDENLY CUT OFF CAME FROM AN OPEN WINDOW HIGH ABOVE
IT SEEMS THAT SARUMAN THINKS SO TOO SAID GANDALF LET US LEAVE THEM
THEY RETURNED NOW TO THE RUINS OF THE GATE HARDLY HAD THEY PASSED OUT UNDER THE ARCH WHEN FROM AMONG THE SHADOWS OF THE PILED STONES WHERE THEY HAD STOOD TREEBEARD AND A DOZEN OTHER ENTS CAME STRIDING UP ARAGORN GIMLI AND LEGOLAS GAZED AT THEM IN WONDER
HERE ARE THREE OF MY COMPANIONS TREEBEARD SAID GANDALF I HAVE SPOKEN OF THEM BUT YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN THEM HE NAMED THEM ONE BY ONE
THE OLD ENT LOOKED AT THEM LONG AND SEARCHINGLY AND SPOKE TO THEM IN TURN LAST HE TURNED TO LEGOLAS SO YOU HAVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM MIRKWOOD MY GOOD ELF A VERY GREAT FOREST IT USED TO BE
AND STILL IS SAID LEGOLAS BUT NOT SO GREAT THAT WE WHO DWELL THERE EVER TIRE OF SEEING NEW TREES I SHOULD DEARLY LOVE TO JOURNEY IN FANGORNS WOOD I SCARCELY PASSED BEYOND THE EAVES OF IT AND I DID NOT WISH TO TURN BACK
TREEBEARDS EYES GLEAMED WITH PLEASURE I HOPE YOU MAY HAVE YOUR WISH ERE THE HILLS BE MUCH OLDER HE SAID
I WILL COME IF I HAVE THE FORTUNE SAID LEGOLAS I HAVE MADE A BARGAIN WITH MY FRIEND THAT IF ALL GOES WELL WE WILL VISIT FANGORN TOGETHER  BY YOUR LEAVE
ANY ELF THAT COMES WITH YOU WILL BE WELCOME SAID TREEBEARD
THE FRIEND I SPEAK OF IS NOT AN ELF SAID LEGOLAS I MEAN GIMLI GLOINS SON HERE GIMLI BOWED LOW AND THE AXE SLIPPED FROM HIS BELT AND CLATTERED ON THE GROUND
HOOM HM AH NOW SAID TREEBEARD LOOKING DARKEYED AT HIM A DWARF AND AN AXEBEARER HOOM I HAVE GOOD WILL TO ELVES BUT YOU ASK MUCH THIS IS A STRANGE FRIENDSHIP
STRANGE IT MAY SEEM SAID LEGOLAS BUT WHILE GIMLI LIVES I SHALL NOT COME TO FANGORN ALONE HIS AXE IS NOT FOR TREES BUT FOR ORCNECKS O FANGORN MASTER OF FANGORNS WOOD FORTYTWO HE HEWED IN THE BATTLE
HOO COME NOW SAID TREEBEARD THAT IS A BETTER STORY WELL WELL THINGS WILL GO AS THEY WILL AND THERE IS NO NEED TO HURRY TO MEET THEM BUT NOW WE MUST PART FOR A WHILE DAY IS DRAWING TO AN END YET GANDALF SAYS YOU MUST GO ERE NIGHTFALL AND THE LORD OF THE MARK IS EAGER FOR HIS OWN HOUSE
YES WE MUST GO AND GO NOW SAID GANDALF I FEAR THAT I MUST TAKE YOUR GATEKEEPERS FROM YOU BUT YOU WILL MANAGE WELL ENOUGH WITHOUT THEM
MAYBE I SHALL SAID TREEBEARD BUT I SHALL MISS THEM WE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS IN SO SHORT A WHILE THAT I THINK I MUST BE GETTING HASTY  GROWING BACKWARDS TOWARDS YOUTH PERHAPS BUT THERE THEY ARE THE FIRST NEW THING UNDER SUN OR MOON THAT I HAVE SEEN FOR MANY A LONG LONG DAY I SHALL NOT FORGET THEM I HAVE PUT THEIR NAMES INTO THE LONG LIST ENTS WILL REMEMBER IT
ENTS THE EARTHBORN OLD AS MOUNTAINS
THE WIDEWALKERS WATER DRINKING
AND HUNGRY AS HUNTERS THE HOBBIT CHILDREN
THE LAUGHINGFOLK THE LITTLE PEOPLE

THEY SHALL REMAIN FRIENDS AS LONG AS LEAVES ARE RENEWED FARE YOU WELL BUT IF YOU HEAR NEWS UP IN YOUR PLEASANT LAND IN THE SHIRE SEND ME WORD YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WORD OR SIGHT OF THE ENTWIVES COME YOURSELVES IF YOU CAN
WE WILL SAID MERRY AND PIPPIN TOGETHER AND THEY TURNED AWAY HASTILY TREEBEARD LOOKED AT THEM AND WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE SHAKING HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY THEN HE TURNED TO GANDALF
SO SARUMAN WOULD NOT LEAVE HE SAID I DID NOT THINK HE WOULD HIS HEART IS AS ROTTEN AS A BLACK HUORNS STILL IF I WERE OVERCOME AND ALL MY TREES DESTROYED I WOULD NOT COME WHILE I HAD ONE DARK HOLE LEFT TO HIDE IN
NO SAID GANDALF BUT YOU HAVE NOT PLOTTED TO COVER ALL THE WORLD WITH YOUR TREES AND CHOKE ALL OTHER LIVING THINGS BUT THERE IT IS SARUMAN REMAINS TO NURSE HIS HATRED AND WEAVE AGAIN SUCH WEBS AS HE CAN HE HAS THE KEY OF ORTHANC BUT HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE
INDEED NO ENTS WILL SEE TO THAT SAID TREEBEARD SARUMAN SHALL NOT SET FOOT BEYOND THE ROCK WITHOUT MY LEAVE ENTS WILL WATCH OVER HIM
GOOD SAID GANDALF THAT IS WHAT I HOPED NOW I CAN GO AND TURN TO OTHER MATTERS WITH ONE CARE THE LESS BUT YOU MUST BE WARY THE WATERS HAVE GONE DOWN IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO PUT SENTINELS ROUND THE TOWER I FEAR I DO NOT DOUBT THAT THERE WERE DEEP WAYS DELVED UNDER ORTHANC AND THAT SARUMAN HOPES TO GO AND COME UNMARKED BEFORE LONG IF YOU WILL UNDERTAKE THE LABOUR I BEG YOU TO POUR IN THE WATERS AGAIN AND DO SO UNTIL ISENGARD REMAINS A STANDING POOL OR YOU DISCOVER THE OUTLETS WHEN ALL THE UNDERGROUND PLACES ARE DROWNED AND THE OUTLETS BLOCKED THEN SARUMAN MUST STAY UPSTAIRS AND LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOWS
LEAVE IT TO THE ENTS SAID TREEBEARD WE SHALL SEARCH THE VALLEY FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND PEER UNDER EVERY PEBBLE TREES ARE COMING BACK TO LIVE HERE OLD TREES WILD TREES THE WATCHWOOD WE WILL CALL IT NOT A SQUIRREL WILL GO HERE BUT I SHALL KNOW OF IT LEAVE IT TO ENTS UNTIL SEVEN TIMES THE YEARS IN WHICH HE TORMENTED US HAVE PASSED WE SHALL NOT TIRE OF WATCHING HIM



CHAPTER 11
THE PALANTIR

THE SUN WAS SINKING BEHIND THE LONG WESTERN ARM OF THE MOUNTAINS WHEN GANDALF AND HIS COMPANIONS AND THE KING WITH HIS RIDERS SET OUT AGAIN FROM ISENGARD GANDALF TOOK MERRY BEHIND HIM AND ARAGORN TOOK PIPPIN TWO OF THE KINGS MEN WENT ON AHEAD RIDING SWIFTLY AND PASSED SOON OUT OF SIGHT DOWN INTO THE VALLEY THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AT AN EASY PACE
ENTS IN A SOLEMN ROW STOOD LIKE STATUES AT THE GATE WITH THEIR LONG ARMS UPLIFTED BUT THEY MADE NO SOUND MERRY AND PIPPIN LOOKED BACK WHEN THEY HAD PASSED SOME WAY DOWN THE WINDING ROAD SUNLIGHT WAS STILL SHINING IN THE SKY BUT LONG SHADOWS REACHED OVER ISENGARD GREY RUINS FALLING INTO DARKNESS TREEBEARD STOOD ALONE THERE NOW LIKE THE DISTANT STUMP OF AN OLD TREE THE HOBBITS THOUGHT OF THEIR FIRST MEETING UPON THE SUNNY LEDGE FAR AWAY ON THE BORDERS OF FANGORN
THEY CAME TO THE PILLAR OF THE WHITE HAND THE PILLAR WAS STILL STANDING BUT THE GRAVEN HAND HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN AND BROKEN INTO SMALL PIECES RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THE LONG FOREFINGER LAY WHITE IN THE DUSK ITS RED NAIL DARKENING TO BLACK
THE ENTS PAY ATTENTION TO EVERY DETAIL SAID GANDALF
THEY RODE ON AND EVENING DEEPENED IN THE VALLEY
ARE WE RIDING FAR TONIGHT GANDALF ASKED MERRY AFTER A WHILE I DONT KNOW HOW YOU FEEL WITH SMALL RAGTAG DANGLING BEHIND YOU BUT THE RAGTAG IS TIRED AND WILL BE GLAD TO STOP DANGLING AND LIE DOWN
SO YOU HEARD THAT SAID GANDALF DONT LET IT RANKLE BE THANKFUL NO LONGER WORDS WERE AIMED AT YOU HE HAD HIS EYES ON YOU IF IT IS ANY COMFORT TO YOUR PRIDE I SHOULD SAY THAT AT THE MOMENT YOU AND PIPPIN ARE MORE IN HIS THOUGHTS THAN ALL THE REST OF US WHO YOU ARE HOW YOU CAME THERE AND WHY WHAT YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU WERE CAPTURED AND IF SO HOW YOU ESCAPED WHEN ALL THE ORCS PERISHED  IT IS WITH THOSE LITTLE RIDDLES THAT THE GREAT MIND OF SARUMAN IS TROUBLED A SNEER FROM HIM MERIADOC IS A COMPLIMENT IF YOU FEEL HONOURED BY HIS CONCERN
THANK YOU SAID MERRY BUT IT IS A GREATER HONOUR TO DANGLE AT YOUR TAIL GANDALF FOR ONE THING IN THAT POSITION ONE HAS A CHANCE OF PUTTING A QUESTION A SECOND TIME ARE WE RIDING FAR TONIGHT
GANDALF LAUGHED A MOST UNQUENCHABLE HOBBIT ALL WIZARDS SHOULD HAVE A HOBBIT OR TWO IN THEIR CARE  TO TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF THE WORD AND TO CORRECT THEM I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT I HAVE GIVEN THOUGHT EVEN TO THESE SIMPLE MATTERS WE WILL RIDE FOR A FEW HOURS GENTLY UNTIL WE COME TO THE END OF THE VALLEY TOMORROW WE MUST RIDE FASTER
WHEN WE CAME WE MEANT TO GO STRAIGHT FROM ISENGARD BACK TO THE KINGS HOUSE AT EDORAS OVER THE PLAINS A RIDE OF SOME DAYS BUT WE HAVE TAKEN THOUGHT AND CHANGED THE PLAN MESSENGERS HAVE GONE AHEAD TO HELMS DEEP TO WARN THEM THAT THE KING IS RETURNING TOMORROW HE WILL RIDE FROM THERE WITH MANY MEN TO DUNHARROW BY PATHS AMONG THE HILLS FROM NOW ON NO MORE THAN TWO OR THREE TOGETHER ARE TO GO OPENLY OVER THE LAND BY DAY OR NIGHT WHEN IT CAN BE AVOIDED
NOTHING OR A DOUBLE HELPING IS YOUR WAY SAID MERRY I AM AFRAID I WAS NOT LOOKING BEYOND TONIGHTS BED WHERE AND WHAT ARE HELMS DEEP AND ALL THE REST OF IT I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY
THEN YOUD BEST LEARN SOMETHING IF YOU WISH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT NOT JUST NOW AND NOT FROM ME I HAVE TOO MANY PRESSING THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
ALL RIGHT ILL TACKLE STRIDER BY THE CAMPFIRE HES LESS TESTY BUT WHY ALL THIS SECRECY I THOUGHT WED WON THE BATTLE
YES WE HAVE WON BUT ONLY THE FIRST VICTORY AND THAT IN ITSELF INCREASES OUR DANGER THERE WAS SOME LINK BETWEEN ISENGARD AND MORDOR WHICH I HAVE NOT YET FATHOMED HOW THEY EXCHANGED NEWS I AM NOT SURE BUT THEY DID SO THE EYE OF BARADDUR WILL BE LOOKING IMPATIENTLY TOWARDS THE WIZARDS VALE I THINK AND TOWARDS ROHAN THE LESS IT SEES THE BETTER
THE ROAD PASSED SLOWLY WINDING DOWN THE VALLEY NOW FURTHER AND NOW NEARER ISEN FLOWED IN ITS STONY BED NIGHT CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS ALL THE MISTS WERE GONE A CHILL WIND BLEW THE MOON NOW WAXING ROUND FILLED THE EASTERN SKY WITH A PALE COLD SHEEN THE SHOULDERS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THEIR RIGHT SLOPED DOWN TO BARE HILLS THE WIDE PLAINS OPENED GREY BEFORE THEM
AT LAST THEY HALTED THEN THEY TURNED ASIDE LEAVING THE HIGHWAY AND TAKING TO THE SWEET UPLAND TURF AGAIN GOING WESTWARD A MILE OR SO THEY CAME TO A DALE IT OPENED SOUTHWARD LEANING BACK INTO THE SLOPE OF ROUND DOL BARAN THE LAST HILL OF THE NORTHERN RANGES GREENFOOTED CROWNED WITH HEATHER THE SIDES OF THE GLEN WERE SHAGGY WITH LAST YEARS BRACKEN AMONG WHICH THE TIGHTCURLED FRONDS OF SPRING WERE JUST THRUSTING THROUGH THE SWEETSCENTED EARTH THORNBUSHES GREW THICK UPON THE LOW BANKS AND UNDER THEM THEY MADE THEIR CAMP TWO HOURS OR SO BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THEY LIT A FIRE IN A HOLLOW DOWN AMONG THE ROOTS OF A SPREADING HAWTHORN TALL AS A TREE WRITHEN WITH AGE BUT HALE IN EVERY LIMB BUDS WERE SWELLING AT EACH TWIGS TIP
GUARDS WERE SET TWO AT A WATCH THE REST AFTER THEY HAD SUPPED WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN A CLOAK AND BLANKET AND SLEPT THE HOBBITS LAY IN A CORNER BY THEMSELVES UPON A PILE OF OLD BRACKEN MERRY WAS SLEEPY BUT PIPPIN NOW SEEMED CURIOUSLY RESTLESS THE BRACKEN CRACKED AND RUSTLED AS HE TWISTED AND TURNED

PIPPIN SAID NO MORE HE LAY STILL NOW BUT SLEEP REMAINED FAR AWAY AND IT WAS NOT ENCOURAGED BY THE SOUND OF MERRY BREATHING SOFTLY ASLEEP IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER SAYING GOOD NIGHT THE THOUGHT OF THE DARK GLOBE SEEMED TO GROW STRONGER AS ALL GREW QUIET PIPPIN FELT AGAIN ITS WEIGHT IN HIS HANDS AND SAW AGAIN THE MYSTERIOUS RED DEPTHS INTO WHICH HE HAD LOOKED FOR A MOMENT HE TOSSED AND TURNED AND TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE
AT LAST HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER HE GOT UP AND LOOKED ROUND IT WAS CHILLY AND HE WRAPPED HIS CLOAK ABOUT HIM THE MOON WAS SHINING COLD AND WHITE DOWN INTO THE DELL AND THE SHADOWS OF THE BUSHES WERE BLACK ALL ABOUT LAY SLEEPING SHAPES THE TWO GUARDS WERE NOT IN VIEW THEY WERE UP ON THE HILL PERHAPS OR HIDDEN IN THE BRACKEN DRIVEN BY SOME IMPULSE THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND PIPPIN WALKED SOFTLY TO WHERE GANDALF LAY HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM THE WIZARD SEEMED ASLEEP BUT WITH LIDS NOT FULLY CLOSED THERE WAS A GLITTER OF EYES UNDER HIS LONG LASHES PIPPIN STEPPED BACK HASTILY BUT GANDALF MADE NO SIGN AND DRAWN FORWARD ONCE MORE HALF AGAINST HIS WILL THE HOBBIT CREPT UP AGAIN FROM BEHIND THE WIZARDS HEAD HE WAS ROLLED IN A BLANKET WITH HIS CLOAK SPREAD OVER THE TOP AND CLOSE BESIDE HIM BETWEEN HIS RIGHT SIDE AND HIS BENT ARM THERE WAS A HUMMOCK SOMETHING ROUND WRAPPED IN A DARK CLOTH HIS HAND SEEMED ONLY JUST TO HAVE SLIPPED OFF IT TO THE GROUND
HARDLY BREATHING PIPPIN CREPT NEARER FOOT BY FOOT AT LAST HE KNELT DOWN THEN HE PUT HIS HANDS OUT STEALTHILY AND SLOWLY LIFTED THE LUMP UP IT DID NOT SEEM QUITE SO HEAVY AS HE HAD EXPECTED ONLY SOME BUNDLE OF ODDMENTS PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT WITH A STRANGE SENSE OF RELIEF BUT HE DID NOT PUT THE BUNDLE DOWN AGAIN HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT CLASPING IT THEN AN IDEA CAME INTO HIS MIND HE TIPTOED AWAY FOUND A LARGE STONE AND CAME BACK
QUICKLY NOW HE DREW OFF THE CLOTH WRAPPED THE STONE IN IT AND KNEELING DOWN LAID IT BACK BY THE WIZARDS HAND THEN AT LAST HE LOOKED AT THE THING THAT HE HAD UNCOVERED THERE IT WAS A SMOOTH GLOBE OF CRYSTAL NOW DARK AND DEAD LYING BARE BEFORE HIS KNEES PIPPIN LIFTED IT COVERED IT HURRIEDLY IN HIS OWN CLOAK AND HALF TURNED TO GO BACK TO HIS BED AT THAT MOMENT GANDALF MOVED IN HIS SLEEP AND MUTTERED SOME WORDS THEY SEEMED TO BE IN A STRANGE TONGUE HIS HAND GROPED OUT AND CLASPED THE WRAPPED STONE THEN HE SIGHED AND DID NOT MOVE AGAIN
YOU IDIOTIC FOOL PIPPIN MUTTERED TO HIMSELF YOURE GOING TO GET YOURSELF INTO FRIGHTFUL TROUBLE PUT IT BACK QUICK BUT HE FOUND NOW THAT HIS KNEES QUAKED AND HE DID NOT DARE TO GO NEAR ENOUGH TO THE WIZARD TO REACH THE BUNDLE ILL NEVER GET IT BACK NOW WITHOUT WAKING HIM HE THOUGHT NOT TILL IM A BIT CALMER SO I MAY AS WELL HAVE A LOOK FIRST NOT JUST HERE THOUGH HE STOLE AWAY AND SAT DOWN ON A GREEN HILLOCK NOT FAR FROM HIS BED THE MOON LOOKED IN OVER THE EDGE OF THE DELL
PIPPIN SAT WITH HIS KNEES DRAWN UP AND THE BALL BETWEEN THEM HE BENT LOW OVER IT LOOKING LIKE A GREEDY CHILD STOOPING OVER A BOWL OF FOOD IN A CORNER AWAY FROM OTHERS HE DREW HIS CLOAK ASIDE AND GAZED AT IT THE AIR SEEMED STILL AND TENSE ABOUT HIM AT FIRST THE GLOBE WAS DARK BLACK AS JET WITH THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING ON ITS SURFACE THEN THERE CAME A FAINT GLOW AND STIR IN THE HEART OF IT AND IT HELD HIS EYES SO THAT NOW HE COULD NOT LOOK AWAY SOON ALL THE INSIDE SEEMED ON FIRE THE BALL WAS SPINNING OR THE LIGHTS WITHIN WERE REVOLVING SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS WENT OUT HE GAVE A GASP AND STRUGGLED BUT HE REMAINED BENT CLASPING THE BALL WITH BOTH HANDS CLOSER AND CLOSER HE BENT AND THEN BECAME RIGID HIS LIPS MOVED SOUNDLESSLY FOR A WHILE THEN WITH A STRANGLED CRY HE FELL BACK AND LAY STILL
THE CRY WAS PIERCING THE GUARDS LEAPT DOWN FROM THE BANKS ALL THE CAMP WAS SOON ASTIR
SO THIS IS THE THIEF SAID GANDALF HASTILY HE CAST HIS CLOAK OVER THE GLOBE WHERE IT LAY BUT YOU PIPPIN THIS IS A GRIEVOUS TURN TO THINGS HE KNELT BY PIPPINS BODY THE HOBBIT WAS LYING ON HIS BACK RIGID WITH UNSEEING EYES STARING UP AT THE SKY THE DEVILRY WHAT MISCHIEF HAS HE DONE  TO HIMSELF AND TO ALL OF US THE WIZARDS FACE WAS DRAWN AND HAGGARD
HE TOOK PIPPINS HAND AND BENT OVER HIS FACE LISTENING FOR HIS BREATH THEN HE LAID HIS HANDS ON HIS BROW THE HOBBIT SHUDDERED HIS EYES CLOSED HE CRIED OUT AND SAT UP STARING IN BEWILDERMENT AT ALL THE FACES ROUND HIM PALE IN THE MOONLIGHT
IT IS NOT FOR YOU SARUMAN HE CRIED IN A SHRILL AND TONELESS VOICE SHRINKING AWAY FROM GANDALF I WILL SEND FOR IT AT ONCE DO YOU UNDERSTAND SAY JUST THAT THEN HE STRUGGLED TO GET UP AND ESCAPE BUT GANDALF HELD HIM GENTLY AND FIRMLY
PEREGRIN TOOK HE SAID COME BACK
THE HOBBIT RELAXED AND FELL BACK CLINGING TO THE WIZARDS HAND GANDALF HE CRIED GANDALF FORGIVE ME
FORGIVE YOU SAID THE WIZARD TELL ME FIRST WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
I I TOOK THE BALL AND LOOKED AT IT STAMMERED PIPPIN AND I SAW THINGS THAT FRIGHTENED ME AND I WANTED TO GO AWAY BUT I COULDNT AND THEN HE CAME AND QUESTIONED ME AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND AND THAT IS ALL I REMEMBER
THAT WONT DO SAID GANDALF STERNLY WHAT DID YOU SEE AND WHAT DID YOU SAY
PIPPIN SHUT HIS EYES AND SHIVERED BUT SAID NOTHING THEY ALL STARED AT HIM IN SILENCE EXCEPT MERRY WHO TURNED AWAY BUT GANDALFS FACE WAS STILL HARD SPEAK HE SAID
IN A LOW HESITATING VOICE PIPPIN BEGAN AGAIN AND SLOWLY HIS WORDS GREW CLEARER AND STRONGER I SAW A DARK SKY AND TALL BATTLEMENTS HE SAID AND TINY STARS IT SEEMED VERY FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO YET HARD AND CLEAR THEN THE STARS WENT IN AND OUT  THEY WERE CUT OFF BY THINGS WITH WINGS VERY BIG I THINK REALLY BUT IN THE GLASS THEY LOOKED LIKE BATS WHEELING ROUND THE TOWER I THOUGHT THERE WERE NINE OF THEM ONE BEGAN TO FLY STRAIGHT TOWARDS ME GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER IT HAD A HORRIBLE  NO NO I CANT SAY
I TRIED TO GET AWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD FLY OUT BUT WHEN IT HAD COVERED ALL THE GLOBE IT DISAPPEARED THEN HE CAME HE DID NOT SPEAK SO THAT I COULD HEAR WORDS HE JUST LOOKED AND I UNDERSTOOD
SO YOU HAVE COME BACK WHY HAVE YOU NEGLECTED TO REPORT FOR SO LONG
I DID NOT ANSWER HE SAID WHO ARE YOU I STILL DID NOT ANSWER BUT IT HURT ME HORRIBLY AND HE PRESSED ME SO I SAID A HOBBIT
THEN SUDDENLY HE SEEMED TO SEE ME AND HE LAUGHED AT ME IT WAS CRUEL IT WAS LIKE BEING STABBED WITH KNIVES I STRUGGLED BUT HE SAID WAIT A MOMENT WE SHALL MEET AGAIN SOON TELL SARUMAN THAT THIS DAINTY IS NOT FOR HIM I WILL SEND FOR IT AT ONCE DO YOU UNDERSTAND SAY JUST THAT
THEN HE GLOATED OVER ME I FELT I WAS FALLING TO PIECES NO NO I CANT SAY ANY MORE I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE
LOOK AT ME SAID GANDALF
PIPPIN LOOKED UP STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES THE WIZARD HELD HIS GAZE FOR A MOMENT IN SILENCE THEN HIS FACE GREW GENTLER AND THE SHADOW OF A SMILE APPEARED HE LAID HIS HAND SOFTLY ON PIPPINS HEAD
ALL RIGHT HE SAID SAY NO MORE YOU HAVE TAKEN NO HARM THERE IS NO LIE IN YOUR EYES AS I FEARED BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK LONG WITH YOU A FOOL BUT AN HONEST FOOL YOU REMAIN PEREGRIN TOOK WISER ONES MIGHT HAVE DONE WORSE IN SUCH A PASS BUT MARK THIS YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS TOO MAINLY BY GOOD FORTUNE AS IT IS CALLED YOU CANNOT COUNT ON IT A SECOND TIME IF HE HAD QUESTIONED YOU THEN AND THERE ALMOST CERTAINLY YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ALL THAT YOU KNOW TO THE RUIN OF US ALL BUT HE WAS TOO EAGER HE DID NOT WANT INFORMATION ONLY HE WANTED YOU QUICKLY SO THAT HE COULD DEAL WITH YOU IN THE DARK TOWER SLOWLY DONT SHUDDER IF YOU WILL MEDDLE IN THE AFFAIRS OF WIZARDS YOU MUST BE PREPARED TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS BUT COME I FORGIVE YOU BE COMFORTED THINGS HAVE NOT TURNED OUT AS EVILLY AS THEY MIGHT
HE LIFTED PIPPIN GENTLY AND CARRIED HIM BACK TO HIS BED MERRY FOLLOWED AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM LIE THERE AND REST IF YOU CAN PIPPIN SAID GANDALF TRUST ME IF YOU FEEL AN ITCH IN YOUR PALMS AGAIN TELL ME OF IT SUCH THINGS CAN BE CURED BUT ANYWAY MY DEAR HOBBIT DONT PUT A LUMP OF ROCK UNDER MY ELBOW AGAIN NOW I WILL LEAVE YOU TWO TOGETHER FOR A WHILE
WITH THAT GANDALF RETURNED TO THE OTHERS WHO WERE STILL STANDING BY THE ORTHANCSTONE IN TROUBLED THOUGHT PERIL COMES IN THE NIGHT WHEN LEAST EXPECTED HE SAID WE HAVE HAD A NARROW ESCAPE
HOW IS THE HOBBIT PIPPIN ASKED ARAGORN
I THINK ALL WILL BE WELL NOW ANSWERED GANDALF HE WAS NOT HELD LONG AND HOBBITS HAVE AN AMAZING POWER OF RECOVERY THE MEMORY OR THE HORROR OF IT WILL PROBABLY FADE QUICKLY TOO QUICKLY PERHAPS WILL YOU ARAGORN TAKE THE ORTHANCSTONE AND GUARD IT IT IS A DANGEROUS CHARGE
DANGEROUS INDEED BUT NOT TO ALL SAID ARAGORN THERE IS ONE WHO MAY CLAIM IT BY RIGHT FOR THIS ASSUREDLY IS THE PALANTIR OF ORTHANC FROM THE TREASURY OF ELENDIL SET HERE BY THE KINGS OF GONDOR NOW MY HOUR DRAWS NEAR I WILL TAKE IT
GANDALF LOOKED AT ARAGORN AND THEN TO THE SURPRISE OF THE OTHERS HE LIFTED THE COVERED STONE AND BOWED AS HE PRESENTED IT
RECEIVE IT LORD HE SAID IN EARNEST OF OTHER THINGS THAT SHALL BE GIVEN BACK BUT IF I MAY COUNSEL YOU IN THE USE OF YOUR OWN DO NOT USE IT  YET BE WARY
WHEN HAVE I BEEN HASTY OR UNWARY WHO HAVE WAITED AND PREPARED FOR SO MANY LONG YEARS SAID ARAGORN
NEVER YET DO NOT THEN STUMBLE AT THE END OF THE ROAD ANSWERED GANDALF BUT AT THE LEAST KEEP THIS THING SECRET YOU AND ALL OTHERS THAT STAND HERE THE HOBBIT PEREGRIN ABOVE ALL SHOULD NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS BESTOWED THE EVIL FIT MAY COME ON HIM AGAIN FOR ALAS HE HAS HANDLED IT AND LOOKED IN IT AS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED HE OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE TOUCHED IT IN ISENGARD AND THERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKER BUT MY MIND WAS BENT ON SARUMAN AND I DID NOT AT ONCE GUESS THE NATURE OF THE STONE THEN I WAS WEARY AND AS I LAY PONDERING IT SLEEP OVERCAME ME NOW I KNOW
YES THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT SAID ARAGORN AT LAST WE KNOW THE LINK BETWEEN ISENGARD AND MORDOR AND HOW IT WORKED MUCH IS EXPLAINED
STRANGE POWERS HAVE OUR ENEMIES AND STRANGE WEAKNESSES SAID THEODEN BUT IT HAS LONG BEEN SAID OFT EVIL WILL SHALL EVIL MAR
THAT MANY TIMES IS SEEN SAID GANDALF BUT AT THIS TIME WE HAVE BEEN STRANGELY FORTUNATE MAYBE I HAVE BEEN SAVED BY THIS HOBBIT FROM A GRAVE BLUNDER I HAD CONSIDERED WHETHER OR NOT TO PROBE THIS STONE MYSELF TO FIND ITS USES HAD I DONE SO I SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVEALED TO HIM MYSELF I AM NOT READY FOR SUCH A TRIAL IF INDEED I SHALL EVER BE SO BUT EVEN IF I FOUND THE POWER TO WITHDRAW MYSELF IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS FOR HIM TO SEE ME YET  UNTIL THE HOUR COMES WHEN SECRECY WILL AVAIL NO LONGER
THAT HOUR IS NOW COME I THINK SAID ARAGORN
NOT YET SAID GANDALF THERE REMAINS A SHORT WHILE OF DOUBT WHICH WE MUST USE THE ENEMY IT IS CLEAR THOUGHT THAT THE STONE WAS IN ORTHANC  WHY SHOULD HE NOT AND THAT THEREFORE THE HOBBIT WAS CAPTIVE THERE DRIVEN TO LOOK IN THE GLASS FOR HIS TORMENT BY SARUMAN THAT DARK MIND WILL BE FILLED NOW WITH THE VOICE AND FACE OF THE HOBBIT AND WITH EXPECTATION IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE HE LEARNS HIS ERROR WE MUST SNATCH THAT TIME WE HAVE BEEN TOO LEISURELY WE MUST MOVE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ISENGARD IS NO PLACE NOW TO LINGER IN I WILL RIDE AHEAD AT ONCE WITH PEREGRIN TOOK IT WILL BE BETTER FOR HIM THAN LYING IN THE DARK WHILE OTHERS SLEEP
I WILL KEEP EOMER AND TEN RIDERS SAID THE KING THEY SHALL RIDE WITH ME AT EARLY DAY THE REST MAY GO WITH ARAGORN AND RIDE AS SOON AS THEY HAVE A MIND
AS YOU WILL SAID GANDALF BUT MAKE ALL THE SPEED YOU MAY TO THE COVER OF THE HILLS TO HELMS DEEP
AT THAT MOMENT A SHADOW FELL OVER THEM THE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT SEEMED TO BE SUDDENLY CUT OFF SEVERAL OF THE RIDERS CRIED OUT AND CROUCHED HOLDING THEIR ARMS ABOVE THEIR HEADS AS IF TO WARD OFF A BLOW FROM ABOVE A BLIND FEAR AND A DEADLY COLD FELL ON THEM COWERING THEY LOOKED UP A VAST WINGED SHAPE PASSED OVER THE MOON LIKE A BLACK CLOUD IT WHEELED AND WENT NORTH FLYING AT A SPEED GREATER THAN ANY WIND OF MIDDLEEARTH THE STARS FAINTED BEFORE IT IT WAS GONE
THEY STOOD UP RIGID AS STONES GANDALF WAS GAZING UP HIS ARMS OUT AND DOWNWARDS STIFF HIS HANDS CLENCHED
NAZGUL HE CRIED THE MESSENGER OF MORDOR THE STORM IS COMING THE NAZGUL HAVE CROSSED THE RIVER RIDE RIDE WAIT NOT FOR THE DAWN LET NOT THE SWIFT WAIT FOR THE SLOW RIDE
HE SPRANG AWAY CALLING SHADOWFAX AS HE RAN ARAGORN FOLLOWED HIM GOING TO PIPPIN GANDALF PICKED HIM UP IN HIS ARMS YOU SHALL COME WITH ME THIS TIME HE SAID SHADOWFAX SHALL SHOW YOU HIS PACES THEN HE RAN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SLEPT SHADOWFAX STOOD THERE ALREADY SLINGING THE SMALL BAG WHICH WAS ALL HIS LUGGAGE ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS THE WIZARD LEAPT UPON THE HORSES BACK ARAGORN LIFTED PIPPIN AND SET HIM IN GANDALFS ARMS WRAPPED IN CLOAK AND BLANKET
FAREWELL FOLLOW FAST CRIED GANDALF AWAY SHADOWFAX
THE GREAT HORSE TOSSED HIS HEAD HIS FLOWING TAIL FLICKED IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN HE LEAPT FORWARD SPURNING THE EARTH AND WAS GONE LIKE THE NORTH WIND FROM THE MOUNTAINS
A BEAUTIFUL RESTFUL NIGHT SAID MERRY TO ARAGORN SOME FOLK HAVE WONDERFUL LUCK HE DID NOT WANT TO SLEEP AND HE WANTED TO RIDE WITH GANDALF  AND THERE HE GOES INSTEAD OF BEING TURNED INTO A STONE HIMSELF TO STAND HERE FOR EVER AS A WARNING
IF YOU HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO LIFT THE ORTHANCSTONE AND NOT HE HOW WOULD IT BE NOW SAID ARAGORN YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE WORSE WHO CAN SAY BUT NOW IT IS YOUR LUCK TO COME WITH ME I FEAR AT ONCE GO AND GET READY AND BRING ANYTHING THAT PIPPIN LEFT BEHIND MAKE HASTE
OVER THE PLAINS SHADOWFAX WAS FLYING NEEDING NO URGING AND NO GUIDANCE LESS THAN AN HOUR HAD PASSED AND THEY HAD REACHED THE FORDS OF ISEN AND CROSSED THEM THE MOUND OF THE RIDERS AND ITS COLD SPEARS LAY GREY BEHIND THEM
PIPPIN WAS RECOVERING HE WAS WARM BUT THE WIND IN HIS FACE WAS KEEN AND REFRESHING HE WAS WITH GANDALF THE HORROR OF THE STONE AND OF THE HIDEOUS SHADOW OVER THE MOON WAS FADING THINGS LEFT BEHIND IN THE MISTS OF THE MOUNTAINS OR IN A PASSING DREAM HE DREW A DEEP BREATH
I DID NOT KNOW YOU RODE BAREBACK GANDALF HE SAID YOU HAVENT A SADDLE OR A BRIDLE
I DO NOT RIDE ELFFASHION EXCEPT ON SHADOWFAX SAID GANDALF BUT SHADOWFAX WILL HAVE NO HARNESS YOU DO NOT RIDE SHADOWFAX HE IS WILLING TO CARRY YOU  OR NOT IF HE IS WILLING THAT IS ENOUGH IT IS THEN HIS BUSINESS TO SEE THAT YOU REMAIN ON HIS BACK UNLESS YOU JUMP OFF INTO THE AIR
HOW FAST IS HE GOING ASKED PIPPIN FAST BY THE WIND BUT VERY SMOOTH AND HOW LIGHT HIS FOOTFALLS ARE
HE IS RUNNING NOW AS FAST AS THE SWIFTEST HORSE COULD GALLOP ANSWERED GANDALF BUT THAT IS NOT FAST FOR HIM THE LAND IS RISING A LITTLE HERE AND IS MORE BROKEN THAN IT WAS BEYOND THE RIVER BUT SEE HOW THE WHITE MOUNTAINS ARE DRAWING NEAR UNDER THE STARS YONDER ARE THE THRIHYRNE PEAKS LIKE BLACK SPEARS IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE WE REACH THE BRANCHING ROADS AND COME TO THE DEEPINGCOOMB WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT TWO NIGHTS AGO
PIPPIN WAS SILENT AGAIN FOR A WHILE HE HEARD GANDALF SINGING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF MURMURING BRIEF SNATCHES OF RHYME IN MANY TONGUES AS THE MILES RAN UNDER THEM AT LAST THE WIZARD PASSED INTO A SONG OF WHICH THE HOBBIT CAUGHT THE WORDS A FEW LINES CAME CLEAR TO HIS EARS THROUGH THE RUSHING OF THE WIND
TALL SHIPS AND TALL KINGS
THREE TIMES THREE
WHAT BROUGHT THEY FROM THE FOUNDERED LAND
OVER THE FLOWING SEA
SEVEN STARS AND SEVEN STONES
AND ONE WHITE TREE

WHAT ARE YOU SAYING GANDALF ASKED PIPPIN
I WAS JUST RUNNING OVER SOME OF THE RHYMES OF LORE IN MY MIND ANSWERED THE WIZARD HOBBITS I SUPPOSE HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM EVEN THOSE THAT THEY EVER KNEW
NO NOT ALL SAID PIPPIN AND WE HAVE MANY OF OUR OWN WHICH WOULDNT INTEREST YOU PERHAPS BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS ONE WHAT IS IT ABOUT  THE SEVEN STARS AND SEVEN STONES
ABOUT THE PALANTIRI OF THE KINGS OF OLD SAID GANDALF
AND WHAT ARE THEY
THE NAME MEANT THAT WHICH LOOKS FAR AWAY THE ORTHANCSTONE WAS ONE
THEN IT WAS NOT MADE NOT MADE  PIPPIN HESITATED  BY THE ENEMY
NO SAID GANDALF NOR BY SARUMAN IT IS BEYOND HIS ART AND BEYOND SAURONS TOO THE PALANTIRI CAME FROM BEYOND WESTERNESSE FROM ELDAMAR THE NOLDOR MADE THEM FEANOR HIMSELF MAYBE WROUGHT THEM IN DAYS SO LONG AGO THAT THE TIME CANNOT BE MEASURED IN YEARS BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT SAURON CANNOT TURN TO EVIL USES ALAS FOR SARUMAN IT WAS HIS DOWNFALL AS I NOW PERCEIVE PERILOUS TO US ALL ARE THE DEVICES OF AN ART DEEPER THAN WE POSSESS OURSELVES YET HE MUST BEAR THE BLAME FOOL TO KEEP IT SECRET FOR HIS OWN PROFIT NO WORD DID HE EVER SPEAK OF IT TO ANY OF THE COUNCIL WE HAD NOT YET GIVEN THOUGHT TO THE FATE OF THE PALANTIRI OF GONDOR IN ITS RUINOUS WARS BY MEN THEY WERE ALMOST FORGOTTEN EVEN IN GONDOR THEY WERE A SECRET KNOWN ONLY TO A FEW IN ARNOR THEY WERE REMEMBERED ONLY IN A RHYME OF LORE AMONG THE DUNEDAIN
WHAT DID THE MEN OF OLD USE THEM FOR ASKED PIPPIN DELIGHTED AND ASTONISHED AT GETTING ANSWERS TO SO MANY QUESTIONS AND WONDERING HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST
TO SEE FAR OFF AND TO CONVERSE IN THOUGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER SAID GANDALF IN THAT WAY THEY LONG GUARDED AND UNITED THE REALM OF GONDOR THEY SET UP STONES AT MINAS ANOR AND AT MINAS ITHIL AND AT ORTHANC IN THE RING OF ISENGARD THE CHIEF AND MASTER OF THESE WAS UNDER THE DOME OF STARS AT OSGILIATH BEFORE ITS RUIN THE THREE OTHERS WERE FAR AWAY IN THE NORTH IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND IT IS TOLD THAT THEY WERE AT ANNUMINAS AND AMON SUL AND ELENDILS STONE WAS ON THE TOWER HILLS THAT LOOK TOWARDS MITHLOND IN THE GULF OF LUNE WHERE THE GREY SHIPS LIE
EACH PALANTIR REPLIED TO EACH BUT ALL THOSE IN GONDOR WERE EVER OPEN TO THE VIEW OF OSGILIATH NOW IT APPEARS THAT AS THE ROCK OF ORTHANC HAS WITHSTOOD THE STORMS OF TIME SO THERE THE PALANTIR OF THAT TOWER HAS REMAINED BUT ALONE IT COULD DO NOTHING BUT SEE SMALL IMAGES OF THINGS FAR OFF AND DAYS REMOTE VERY USEFUL NO DOUBT THAT WAS TO SARUMAN YET IT SEEMS THAT HE WAS NOT CONTENT FURTHER AND FURTHER ABROAD HE GAZED UNTIL HE CAST HIS GAZE UPON BARADDUR THEN HE WAS CAUGHT
WHO KNOWS WHERE THE LOST STONES OF ARNOR AND GONDOR NOW LIE BURIED OR DROWNED DEEP BUT ONE AT LEAST SAURON MUST HAVE OBTAINED AND MASTERED TO HIS PURPOSES I GUESS THAT IT WAS THE ITHILSTONE FOR HE TOOK MINAS ITHIL LONG AGO AND TURNED IT INTO AN EVIL PLACE MINAS MORGUL IT HAS BECOME
EASY IT IS NOW TO GUESS HOW QUICKLY THE ROVING EYE OF SARUMAN WAS TRAPPED AND HELD AND HOW EVER SINCE HE HAS BEEN PERSUADED FROM AFAR AND DAUNTED WHEN PERSUASION WOULD NOT SERVE THE BITER BIT THE HAWK UNDER THE EAGLES FOOT THE SPIDER IN A STEEL WEB HOW LONG I WONDER HAS HE BEEN CONSTRAINED TO COME OFTEN TO HIS GLASS FOR INSPECTION AND INSTRUCTION AND THE ORTHANCSTONE SO BENT TOWARDS BARADDUR THAT IF ANY SAVE A WILL OF ADAMANT NOW LOOKS INTO IT IT WILL BEAR HIS MIND AND SIGHT SWIFTLY THITHER AND HOW IT DRAWS ONE TO ITSELF HAVE I NOT FELT IT EVEN NOW MY HEART DESIRES TO TEST MY WILL UPON IT TO SEE IF I COULD NOT WRENCH IT FROM HIM AND TURN IT WHERE I WOULD  TO LOOK ACROSS THE WIDE SEAS OF WATER AND OF TIME TO TIRION THE FAIR AND PERCEIVE THE UNIMAGINABLE HAND AND MIND OF FEANOR AT THEIR WORK WHILE BOTH THE WHITE TREE AND THE GOLDEN WERE IN FLOWER HE SIGHED AND FELL SILENT
I WISH I HAD KNOWN ALL THIS BEFORE SAID PIPPIN I HAD NO NOTION OF WHAT I WAS DOING
OH YES YOU HAD SAID GANDALF YOU KNEW YOU WERE BEHAVING WRONGLY AND FOOLISHLY AND YOU TOLD YOURSELF SO THOUGH YOU DID NOT LISTEN I DID NOT TELL YOU ALL THIS BEFORE BECAUSE IT IS ONLY BY MUSING ON ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED THAT I HAVE AT LAST UNDERSTOOD EVEN AS WE RIDE TOGETHER BUT IF I HAD SPOKEN SOONER IT WOULD NOT HAVE LESSENED YOUR DESIRE OR MADE IT EASIER TO RESIST ON THE CONTRARY NO THE BURNED HAND TEACHES BEST AFTER THAT ADVICE ABOUT FIRE GOES TO THE HEART
IT DOES SAID PIPPIN IF ALL THE SEVEN STONES WERE LAID OUT BEFORE ME NOW I SHOULD SHUT MY EYES AND PUT MY HANDS IN MY POCKETS
GOOD SAID GANDALF THAT IS WHAT I HOPED
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW PIPPIN BEGAN
MERCY CRIED GANDALF IF THE GIVING OF INFORMATION IS TO BE THE CURE OF YOUR INQUISITIVENESS I SHALL SPEND ALL THE REST OF MY DAYS IN ANSWERING YOU WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE NAMES OF ALL THE STARS AND OF ALL LIVING THINGS AND THE WHOLE HISTORY OF MIDDLEEARTH AND OVERHEAVEN AND OF THE SUNDERING SEAS LAUGHED PIPPIN OF COURSE WHAT LESS BUT I AM NOT IN A HURRY TONIGHT AT THE MOMENT I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE BLACK SHADOW I HEARD YOU SHOUT MESSENGER OF MORDOR WHAT WAS IT WHAT COULD IT DO AT ISENGARD
IT WAS A BLACK RIDER ON WINGS A NAZGUL SAID GANDALF IT COULD HAVE TAKEN YOU AWAY TO THE DARK TOWER
BUT IT WAS NOT COMING FOR ME WAS IT FALTERED PIPPIN I MEAN IT DIDNT KNOW THAT I HAD 
OF COURSE NOT SAID GANDALF IT IS TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES OR MORE IN STRAIGHT FLIGHT FROM BARADDUR TO ORTHANC AND EVEN A NAZGUL WOULD TAKE A FEW HOURS TO FLY BETWEEN THEM BUT SARUMAN CERTAINLY LOOKED IN THE STONE SINCE THE ORCRAID AND MORE OF HIS SECRET THOUGHT I DO NOT DOUBT HAS BEEN READ THAN HE INTENDED A MESSENGER HAS BEEN SENT TO FIND OUT WHAT HE IS DOING AND AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TONIGHT ANOTHER WILL COME I THINK AND SWIFTLY SO SARUMAN WILL COME TO THE LAST PINCH OF THE VICE THAT HE HAS PUT HIS HAND IN HE HAS NO CAPTIVE TO SEND HE HAS NO STONE TO SEE WITH AND CANNOT ANSWER THE SUMMONS SAURON WILL ONLY BELIEVE THAT HE IS WITHHOLDING THE CAPTIVE AND REFUSING TO USE THE STONE IT WILL NOT HELP SARUMAN TO TELL THE TRUTH TO THE MESSENGER FOR ISENGARD MAY BE RUINED YET HE IS STILL SAFE IN ORTHANC SO WHETHER HE WILL OR NO HE WILL APPEAR A REBEL YET HE REJECTED US SO AS TO AVOID THAT VERY THING WHAT HE WILL DO IN SUCH A PLIGHT I CANNOT GUESS HE HAS POWER STILL I THINK WHILE IN ORTHANC TO RESIST THE NINE RIDERS HE MAY TRY TO DO SO HE MAY TRY TO TRAP THE NAZGUL OR AT LEAST TO SLAY THE THING ON WHICH IT NOW RIDES THE AIR IN THAT CASE LET ROHAN LOOK TO ITS HORSES
BUT I CANNOT TELL HOW IT WILL FALL OUT WELL OR ILL FOR US IT MAY BE THAT THE COUNSELS OF THE ENEMY WILL BE CONFUSED OR HINDERED BY HIS WRATH WITH SARUMAN IT MAY BE THAT HE WILL LEARN THAT I WAS THERE AND STOOD UPON THE STAIRS OF ORTHANC  WITH HOBBITS AT MY TAIL OR THAT AN HEIR OF ELENDIL LIVES AND STOOD BESIDE ME IF WORMTONGUE WAS NOT DECEIVED BY THE ARMOUR OF ROHAN HE WOULD REMEMBER ARAGORN AND THE TITLE THAT HE CLAIMED THAT IS WHAT I FEAR AND SO WE FLY  NOT FROM DANGER BUT INTO GREATER DANGER EVERY STRIDE OF SHADOWFAX BEARS YOU NEARER TO THE LAND OF SHADOW PEREGRIN TOOK
PIPPIN MADE NO ANSWER BUT CLUTCHED HIS CLOAK AS IF A SUDDEN CHILL HAD STRUCK HIM GREY LAND PASSED UNDER THEM
SEE NOW SAID GANDALF THE WESTFOLD DALES ARE OPENING BEFORE US HERE WE COME BACK TO THE EASTWARD ROAD THE DARK SHADOW YONDER IS THE MOUTH OF THE DEEPINGCOOMB THAT WAY LIES AGLAROND AND THE GLITTERING CAVES DO NOT ASK ME ABOUT THEM ASK GIMLI IF YOU MEET AGAIN AND FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU MAY GET AN ANSWER LONGER THAN YOU WISH YOU WILL NOT SEE THE CAVES YOURSELF NOT ON THIS JOURNEY SOON THEY WILL BE FAR BEHIND
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO STOP AT HELMS DEEP SAID PIPPIN WHERE ARE YOU GOING THEN
TO MINAS TIRITH BEFORE THE SEAS OF WAR SURROUND IT
OH AND HOW FAR IS THAT
LEAGUES UPON LEAGUES ANSWERED GANDALF THRICE AS FAR AS THE DWELLINGS OF KING THEODEN AND THEY ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILES EAST FROM HERE AS THE MESSENGERS OF MORDOR FLY SHADOWFAX MUST RUN A LONGER ROAD WHICH WILL PROVE THE SWIFTER
WE SHALL RIDE NOW TILL DAYBREAK AND THAT IS SOME HOURS AWAY THEN EVEN SHADOWFAX MUST REST IN SOME HOLLOW OF THE HILLS AT EDORAS I HOPE SLEEP IF YOU CAN YOU MAY SEE THE FIRST GLIMMER OF DAWN UPON THE GOLDEN ROOF OF THE HOUSE OF EORL AND IN TWO DAYS THENCE YOU SHALL SEE THE PURPLE SHADOW OF MOUNT MINDOLLUIN AND THE WALLS OF THE TOWER OF DENETHOR WHITE IN THE MORNING
AWAY NOW SHADOWFAX RUN GREATHEART RUN AS YOU HAVE NEVER RUN BEFORE NOW WE ARE COME TO THE LANDS WHERE YOU WERE FOALED AND EVERY STONE YOU KNOW RUN NOW HOPE IS IN SPEED
SHADOWFAX TOSSED HIS HEAD AND CRIED ALOUD AS IF A TRUMPET HAD SUMMONED HIM TO BATTLE THEN HE SPRANG FORWARD FIRE FLEW FROM HIS FEET NIGHT RUSHED OVER HIM
AS HE FELL SLOWLY INTO SLEEP PIPPIN HAD A STRANGE FEELING HE AND GANDALF WERE STILL AS STONE SEATED UPON THE STATUE OF A RUNNING HORSE WHILE THE WORLD ROLLED AWAY BENEATH HIS FEET WITH A GREAT NOISE OF WIND




BOOK IV



CHAPTER 1
THE TAMING OF SMEAGOL

WELL MASTER WERE IN A FIX AND NO MISTAKE SAID SAM GAMGEE HE STOOD DESPONDENTLY WITH HUNCHED SHOULDERS BESIDE FRODO AND PEERED OUT WITH PUCKERED EYES INTO THE GLOOM
IT WAS THE THIRD EVENING SINCE THEY HAD FLED FROM THE COMPANY AS FAR AS THEY COULD TELL THEY HAD ALMOST LOST COUNT OF THE HOURS DURING WHICH THEY HAD CLIMBED AND LABOURED AMONG THE BARREN SLOPES AND STONES OF THE EMYN MUIL SOMETIMES RETRACING THEIR STEPS BECAUSE THEY COULD FIND NO WAY FORWARD SOMETIMES DISCOVERING THAT THEY HAD WANDERED IN A CIRCLE BACK TO WHERE THEY HAD BEEN HOURS BEFORE YET ON THE WHOLE THEY HAD WORKED STEADILY EASTWARD KEEPING AS NEAR AS THEY COULD FIND A WAY TO THE OUTER EDGE OF THIS STRANGE TWISTED KNOT OF HILLS BUT ALWAYS THEY FOUND ITS OUTWARD FACES SHEER HIGH AND IMPASSABLE FROWNING OVER THE PLAIN BELOW BEYOND ITS TUMBLED SKIRTS LAY LIVID FESTERING MARSHES WHERE NOTHING MOVED AND NOT EVEN A BIRD WAS TO BE SEEN
THE HOBBITS STOOD NOW ON THE BRINK OF A TALL CLIFF BARE AND BLEAK ITS FEET WRAPPED IN MIST AND BEHIND THEM ROSE THE BROKEN HIGHLANDS CROWNED WITH DRIFTING CLOUD A CHILL WIND BLEW FROM THE EAST NIGHT WAS GATHERING OVER THE SHAPELESS LANDS BEFORE THEM THE SICKLY GREEN OF THEM WAS FADING TO A SULLEN BROWN FAR AWAY TO THE RIGHT THE ANDUIN THAT HAD GLEAMED FITFULLY IN SUNBREAKS DURING THE DAY WAS NOW HIDDEN IN SHADOW BUT THEIR EYES DID NOT LOOK BEYOND THE RIVER BACK TO GONDOR TO THEIR FRIENDS TO THE LANDS OF MEN SOUTH AND EAST THEY STARED TO WHERE AT THE EDGE OF THE ONCOMING NIGHT A DARK LINE HUNG LIKE DISTANT MOUNTAINS OF MOTIONLESS SMOKE EVERY NOW AND AGAIN A TINY RED GLEAM FAR AWAY FLICKERED UPWARDS ON THE RIM OF EARTH AND SKY
WHAT A FIX SAID SAM THATS THE ONE PLACE IN ALL THE LANDS WEVE EVER HEARD OF THAT WE DONT WANT TO SEE ANY CLOSER AND THATS THE ONE PLACE WERE TRYING TO GET TO AND THATS JUST WHERE WE CANT GET NOHOW WEVE COME THE WRONG WAY ALTOGETHER SEEMINGLY WE CANT GET DOWN AND IF WE DID GET DOWN WED FIND ALL THAT GREEN LAND A NASTY BOG ILL WARRANT PHEW CAN YOU SMELL IT HE SNIFFED AT THE WIND
YES I CAN SMELL IT SAID FRODO BUT HE DID NOT MOVE AND HIS EYES REMAINED FIXED STARING OUT TOWARDS THE DARK LINE AND THE FLICKERING FLAME MORDOR HE MUTTERED UNDER HIS BREATH IF I MUST GO THERE I WISH I COULD COME THERE QUICKLY AND MAKE AN END HE SHUDDERED THE WIND WAS CHILLY AND YET HEAVY WITH AN ODOUR OF COLD DECAY WELL HE SAID AT LAST WITHDRAWING HIS EYES WE CANNOT STAY HERE ALL NIGHT FIX OR NO FIX WE MUST FIND A MORE SHELTERED SPOT AND CAMP ONCE MORE AND PERHAPS ANOTHER DAY WILL SHOW US A PATH
OR ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER MUTTERED SAM OR MAYBE NO DAY WEVE COME THE WRONG WAY
I WONDER SAID FRODO ITS MY DOOM I THINK TO GO TO THAT SHADOW YONDER SO THAT A WAY WILL BE FOUND BUT WILL GOOD OR EVIL SHOW IT TO ME WHAT HOPE WE HAD WAS IN SPEED DELAY PLAYS INTO THE ENEMYS HANDS  AND HERE I AM DELAYED IS IT THE WILL OF THE DARK TOWER THAT STEERS US ALL MY CHOICES HAVE PROVED ILL I SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE COMPANY LONG BEFORE AND COME DOWN FROM THE NORTH EAST OF THE RIVER AND OF THE EMYN MUIL AND SO OVER THE HARD OF BATTLE PLAIN TO THE PASSES OF MORDOR BUT NOW IT ISNT POSSIBLE FOR YOU AND ME ALONE TO FIND A WAY BACK AND THE ORCS ARE PROWLING ON THE EAST BANK EVERY DAY THAT PASSES IS A PRECIOUS DAY LOST I AM TIRED SAM I DONT KNOW WHAT IS TO BE DONE WHAT FOOD HAVE WE GOT LEFT
ONLY THOSE WHAT DYOU CALL EM LEMBAS MR FRODO A FAIR SUPPLY BUT THEY ARE BETTER THAN NAUGHT BY A LONG BITE I NEVER THOUGHT THOUGH WHEN I FIRST SET TOOTH IN THEM THAT I SHOULD EVER COME TO WISH FOR A CHANGE BUT I DO NOW A BIT OF PLAIN BREAD AND A MUG  AYE HALF A MUG  OF BEER WOULD GO DOWN PROPER IVE LUGGED MY COOKINGGEAR ALL THE WAY FROM THE LAST CAMP AND WHAT USE HAS IT BEEN NAUGHT TO MAKE A FIRE WITH FOR A START AND NAUGHT TO COOK NOT EVEN GRASS
THEY TURNED AWAY AND WENT DOWN INTO A STONY HOLLOW THE WESTERING SUN WAS CAUGHT INTO CLOUDS AND NIGHT CAME SWIFTLY THEY SLEPT AS WELL AS THEY COULD FOR THE COLD TURN AND TURN ABOUT IN A NOOK AMONG GREAT JAGGED PINNACLES OF WEATHERED ROCK AT LEAST THEY WERE SHELTERED FROM THE EASTERLY WIND
DID YOU SEE THEM AGAIN MR FRODO ASKED SAM AS THEY SAT STIFF AND CHILLED MUNCHING WAFERS OF LEMBAS IN THE COLD GREY OF EARLY MORNING
NO SAID FRODO IVE HEARD NOTHING AND SEEN NOTHING FOR TWO NIGHTS NOW
NOR ME SAID SAM GRRR THOSE EYES DID GIVE ME A TURN BUT PERHAPS WEVE SHAKEN HIM OFF AT LAST THE MISERABLE SLINKER GOLLUM ILL GIVE HIM GOLLUM IN HIS THROAT IF EVER I GET MY HANDS ON HIS NECK
I HOPE YOULL NEVER NEED TO SAID FRODO I DONT KNOW HOW HE FOLLOWED US BUT IT MAY BE THAT HES LOST US AGAIN AS YOU SAY IN THIS DRY BLEAK LAND WE CANT LEAVE MANY FOOTPRINTS NOR MUCH SCENT EVEN FOR HIS SNUFFLING NOSE
I HOPE THATS THE WAY OF IT SAID SAM I WISH WE COULD BE RID OF HIM FOR GOOD
SO DO I SAID FRODO BUT HES NOT MY CHIEF TROUBLE I WISH WE COULD GET AWAY FROM THESE HILLS I HATE THEM I FEEL ALL NAKED ON THE EAST SIDE STUCK UP HERE WITH NOTHING BUT THE DEAD FLATS BETWEEN ME AND THAT SHADOW YONDER THERES AN EYE IN IT COME ON WEVE GOT TO GET DOWN TODAY SOMEHOW
BUT THAT DAY WORE ON AND WHEN AFTERNOON FADED TOWARDS EVENING THEY WERE STILL SCRAMBLING ALONG THE RIDGE AND HAD FOUND NO WAY OF ESCAPE
SOMETIMES IN THE SILENCE OF THAT BARREN COUNTRY THEY FANCIED THAT THEY HEARD FAINT SOUNDS BEHIND THEM A STONE FALLING OR THE IMAGINED STEP OF FLAPPING FEET ON THE ROCK BUT IF THEY HALTED AND STOOD STILL LISTENING THEY HEARD NO MORE NOTHING BUT THE WIND SIGHING OVER THE EDGES OF THE STONES  YET EVEN THAT REMINDED THEM OF BREATH SOFTLY HISSING THROUGH SHARP TEETH
ALL THAT DAY THE OUTER RIDGE OF THE EMYN MUIL HAD BEEN BENDING GRADUALLY NORTHWARD AS THEY STRUGGLED ON ALONG ITS BRINK THERE NOW STRETCHED A WIDE TUMBLED FLAT OF SCORED AND WEATHERED ROCK CUT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN BY TRENCHLIKE GULLIES THAT SLOPED STEEPLY DOWN TO DEEP NOTCHES IN THE CLIFFFACE TO FIND A PATH IN THESE CLEFTS WHICH WERE BECOMING DEEPER AND MORE FREQUENT FRODO AND SAM WERE DRIVEN TO THEIR LEFT WELL AWAY FROM THE EDGE AND THEY DID NOT NOTICE THAT FOR SEVERAL MILES THEY HAD BEEN GOING SLOWLY BUT STEADILY DOWNHILL THE CLIFFTOP WAS SINKING TOWARDS THE LEVEL OF THE LOWLANDS
AT LAST THEY WERE BROUGHT TO A HALT THE RIDGE TOOK A SHARPER BEND NORTHWARD AND WAS GASHED BY A DEEPER RAVINE ON THE FURTHER SIDE IT REARED UP AGAIN MANY FATHOMS AT A SINGLE LEAP A GREAT GREY CLIFF LOOMED BEFORE THEM CUT SHEER DOWN AS IF BY A KNIFE STROKE THEY COULD GO NO FURTHER FORWARDS AND MUST TURN NOW EITHER WEST OR EAST BUT WEST WOULD LEAD THEM ONLY INTO MORE LABOUR AND DELAY BACK TOWARDS THE HEART OF THE HILLS EAST WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE OUTER PRECIPICE
THERES NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO SCRAMBLE DOWN THIS GULLY SAM SAID FRODO LETS SEE WHAT IT LEADS TO
A NASTY DROP ILL BET SAID SAM
THE CLEFT WAS LONGER AND DEEPER THAN IT SEEMED SOME WAY DOWN THEY FOUND A FEW GNARLED AND STUNTED TREES THE FIRST THEY HAD SEEN FOR DAYS TWISTED BIRCH FOR THE MOST PART WITH HERE AND THERE A FIRTREE MANY WERE DEAD AND GAUNT BITTEN TO THE CORE BY THE EASTERN WINDS ONCE IN MILDER DAYS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A FAIR THICKET IN THE RAVINE BUT NOW AFTER SOME FIFTY YARDS THE TREES CAME TO AN END THOUGH OLD BROKEN STUMPS STRAGGLED ON ALMOST TO THE CLIFFS BRINK THE BOTTOM OF THE GULLY WHICH LAY ALONG THE EDGE OF A ROCKFAULT WAS ROUGH WITH BROKEN STONE AND SLANTED STEEPLY DOWN WHEN THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE END OF IT FRODO STOOPED AND LEANED OUT
LOOK HE SAID WE MUST HAVE COME DOWN A LONG WAY OR ELSE THE CLIFF HAS SUNK ITS MUCH LOWER HERE THAN IT WAS AND IT LOOKS EASIER TOO
SAM KNELT BESIDE HIM AND PEERED RELUCTANTLY OVER THE EDGE THEN HE GLANCED UP AT THE GREAT CLIFF RISING UP AWAY ON THEIR LEFT EASIER HE GRUNTED WELL I SUPPOSE ITS ALWAYS EASIER GETTING DOWN THAN UP THOSE AS CANT FLY CAN JUMP
IT WOULD BE A BIG JUMP STILL SAID FRODO ABOUT WELL  HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT MEASURING IT WITH HIS EYES  ABOUT EIGHTEEN FATHOMS I SHOULD GUESS NOT MORE
AND THATS ENOUGH SAID SAM UGH HOW I DO HATE LOOKING DOWN FROM A HEIGHT BUT LOOKINGS BETTER THAN CLIMBING
ALL THE SAME SAID FRODO I THINK WE COULD CLIMB HERE AND I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO TRY SEE  THE ROCK IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WAS A FEW MILES BACK IT HAS SLIPPED AND CRACKED
THE OUTER FALL WAS INDEED NO LONGER SHEER BUT SLOPED OUTWARDS A LITTLE IT LOOKED LIKE A GREAT RAMPART OR SEAWALL WHOSE FOUNDATIONS HAD SHIFTED SO THAT ITS COURSES WERE ALL TWISTED AND DISORDERED LEAVING GREAT FISSURES AND LONG SLANTING EDGES THAT WERE IN PLACES ALMOST AS WIDE AS STAIRS
AND IF WERE GOING TO TRY AND GET DOWN WE HAD BETTER TRY AT ONCE ITS GETTING DARK EARLY I THINK THERES A STORM COMING
THE SMOKY BLUR OF THE MOUNTAINS IN THE EAST WAS LOST IN A DEEPER BLACKNESS THAT WAS ALREADY REACHING OUT WESTWARDS WITH LONG ARMS THERE WAS A DISTANT MUTTER OF THUNDER BORNE ON THE RISING BREEZE FRODO SNIFFED THE AIR AND LOOKED UP DOUBTFULLY AT THE SKY HE STRAPPED HIS BELT OUTSIDE HIS CLOAK AND TIGHTENED IT AND SETTLED HIS LIGHT PACK ON HIS BACK THEN HE STEPPED TOWARDS THE EDGE IM GOING TO TRY IT HE SAID
VERY GOOD SAID SAM GLOOMILY BUT IM GOING FIRST
YOU SAID FRODO WHATS MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT CLIMBING
I HAVENT CHANGED MY MIND BUT ITS ONLY SENSE PUT THE ONE LOWEST AS IS MOST LIKELY TO SLIP I DONT WANT TO COME DOWN ATOP OF YOU AND KNOCK YOU OFF NO SENSE IN KILLING TWO WITH ONE FALL
BEFORE FRODO COULD STOP HIM HE SAT DOWN SWUNG HIS LEGS OVER THE BRINK AND TWISTED ROUND SCRABBLING WITH HIS TOES FOR A FOOTHOLD IT IS DOUBTFUL IF HE EVER DID ANYTHING BRAVER IN COLD BLOOD OR MORE UNWISE
NO NO SAM YOU OLD ASS SAID FRODO YOULL KILL YOURSELF FOR CERTAIN GOING OVER LIKE THAT WITHOUT EVEN A LOOK TO SEE WHAT TO MAKE FOR COME BACK HE TOOK SAM UNDER THE ARMPITS AND HAULED HIM UP AGAIN NOW WAIT A BIT AND BE PATIENT HE SAID THEN HE LAY ON THE GROUND LEANING OUT AND LOOKING DOWN BUT THE LIGHT SEEMED TO BE FADING QUICKLY ALTHOUGH THE SUN HAD NOT YET SET I THINK WE COULD MANAGE THIS HE SAID PRESENTLY I COULD AT ANY RATE AND YOU COULD TOO IF YOU KEPT YOUR HEAD AND FOLLOWED ME CAREFULLY
I DONT KNOW HOW YOU CAN BE SO SURE SAID SAM WHY YOU CANT SEE TO THE BOTTOM IN THIS LIGHT WHAT IF YOU COMES TO A PLACE WHERE THERES NOWHERE TO PUT YOUR FEET OR YOUR HANDS
CLIMB BACK I SUPPOSE SAID FRODO
EASY SAID OBJECTED SAM BETTER WAIT TILL MORNING AND MORE LIGHT
NO NOT IF I CAN HELP IT SAID FRODO WITH A SUDDEN STRANGE VEHEMENCE I GRUDGE EVERY HOUR EVERY MINUTE IM GOING DOWN TO TRY IT OUT DONT YOU FOLLOW TILL I COME BACK OR CALL
GRIPPING THE STONY LIP OF THE FALL WITH HIS FINGERS HE LET HIMSELF GENTLY DOWN UNTIL WHEN HIS ARMS WERE ALMOST AT FULL STRETCH HIS TOES FOUND A LEDGE ONE STEP DOWN HE SAID AND THIS LEDGE BROADENS OUT TO THE RIGHT I COULD STAND THERE WITHOUT A HOLD ILL HIS WORDS WERE CUT SHORT
THE HURRYING DARKNESS NOW GATHERING GREAT SPEED RUSHED UP FROM THE EAST AND SWALLOWED THE SKY THERE WAS A DRY SPLITTING CRACK OF THUNDER RIGHT OVERHEAD SEARING LIGHTNING SMOTE DOWN INTO THE HILLS THEN CAME A BLAST OF SAVAGE WIND AND WITH IT MINGLING WITH ITS ROAR THERE CAME A HIGH SHRILL SHRIEK THE HOBBITS HAD HEARD JUST SUCH A CRY FAR AWAY IN THE MARISH AS THEY FLED FROM HOBBITON AND EVEN THERE IN THE WOODS OF THE SHIRE IT HAD FROZEN THEIR BLOOD OUT HERE IN THE WASTE ITS TERROR WAS FAR GREATER IT PIERCED THEM WITH COLD BLADES OF HORROR AND DESPAIR STOPPING HEART AND BREATH SAM FELL FLAT ON HIS FACE INVOLUNTARILY FRODO LOOSED HIS HOLD AND PUT HIS HANDS OVER HIS HEAD AND EARS HE SWAYED SLIPPED AND SLITHERED DOWNWARDS WITH A WAILING CRY
SAM HEARD HIM AND CRAWLED WITH AN EFFORT TO THE EDGE MASTER MASTER HE CALLED MASTER
HE HEARD NO ANSWER HE FOUND HE WAS SHAKING ALL OVER BUT HE GATHERED HIS BREATH AND ONCE AGAIN HE SHOUTED MASTER THE WIND SEEMED TO BLOW HIS VOICE BACK INTO HIS THROAT BUT AS IT PASSED ROARING UP THE GULLY AND AWAY OVER THE HILLS A FAINT ANSWERING CRY CAME TO HIS EARS
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT IM HERE BUT I CANT SEE
FRODO WAS CALLING WITH A WEAK VOICE HE WAS NOT ACTUALLY VERY FAR AWAY HE HAD SLID AND NOT FALLEN AND HAD COME UP WITH A JOLT TO HIS FEET ON A WIDER LEDGE NOT MANY YARDS LOWER DOWN FORTUNATELY THE ROCKFACE AT THIS POINT LEANED WELL BACK AND THE WIND HAD PRESSED HIM AGAINST THE CLIFF SO THAT HE HAD NOT TOPPLED OVER HE STEADIED HIMSELF A LITTLE LAYING HIS FACE AGAINST THE COLD STONE FEELING HIS HEART POUNDING BUT EITHER THE DARKNESS HAD GROWN COMPLETE OR ELSE HIS EYES HAD LOST THEIR SIGHT ALL WAS BLACK ABOUT HIM HE WONDERED IF HE HAD BEEN STRUCK BLIND HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH
COME BACK COME BACK HE HEARD SAMS VOICE OUT OF THE BLACKNESS ABOVE
I CANT HE SAID I CANT SEE I CANT FIND ANY HOLD I CANT MOVE YET
WHAT CAN I DO MR FRODO WHAT CAN I DO SHOUTED SAM LEANING OUT DANGEROUSLY FAR WHY COULD NOT HIS MASTER SEE IT WAS DIM CERTAINLY BUT NOT AS DARK AS ALL THAT HE COULD SEE FRODO BELOW HIM A GREY FORLORN FIGURE SPLAYED AGAINST THE CLIFF BUT HE WAS FAR OUT OF THE REACH OF ANY HELPING HAND
THERE WAS ANOTHER CRACK OF THUNDER AND THEN THE RAIN CAME IN A BLINDING SHEET MINGLED WITH HAIL IT DROVE AGAINST THE CLIFF BITTER COLD
IM COMING DOWN TO YOU SHOUTED SAM THOUGH HOW HE HOPED TO HELP IN THAT WAY HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID
NO NO WAIT FRODO CALLED BACK MORE STRONGLY NOW I SHALL BE BETTER SOON I FEEL BETTER ALREADY WAIT YOU CANT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT A ROPE
ROPE CRIED SAM TALKING WILDLY TO HIMSELF IN HIS EXCITEMENT AND RELIEF WELL IF I DONT DESERVE TO BE HUNG ON THE END OF ONE AS A WARNING TO NUMBSKULLS YOURE NOWT BUT A NINNYHAMMER SAM GAMGEE THATS WHAT THE GAFFER SAID TO ME OFTEN ENOUGH IT BEING A WORD OF HIS ROPE
STOP CHATTERING CRIED FRODO NOW RECOVERED ENOUGH TO FEEL BOTH AMUSED AND ANNOYED NEVER MIND YOUR GAFFER ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL YOURSELF YOUVE GOT SOME ROPE IN YOUR POCKET IF SO OUT WITH IT
YES MR FRODO IN MY PACK AND ALL CARRIED IT HUNDREDS OF MILES AND ID CLEAN FORGOTTEN IT
THEN GET BUSY AND LET AN END DOWN
QUICKLY SAM UNSLUNG HIS PACK AND RUMMAGED IN IT THERE INDEED AT THE BOTTOM WAS A COIL OF THE SILKENGREY ROPE MADE BY THE FOLK OF LORIEN HE CAST AN END TO HIS MASTER THE DARKNESS SEEMED TO LIFT FROM FRODOS EYES OR ELSE HIS SIGHT WAS RETURNING HE COULD SEE THE GREY LINE AS IT CAME DANGLING DOWN AND HE THOUGHT IT HAD A FAINT SILVER SHEEN NOW THAT HE HAD SOME POINT IN THE DARKNESS TO FIX HIS EYES ON HE FELT LESS GIDDY LEANING HIS WEIGHT FORWARD HE MADE THE END FAST ROUND HIS WAIST AND THEN HE GRASPED THE LINE WITH BOTH HANDS
SAM STEPPED BACK AND BRACED HIS FEET AGAINST A STUMP A YARD OR TWO FROM THE EDGE HALF HAULED HALF SCRAMBLING FRODO CAME UP AND THREW HIMSELF ON THE GROUND
THUNDER GROWLED AND RUMBLED IN THE DISTANCE AND THE RAIN WAS STILL FALLING HEAVILY THE HOBBITS CRAWLED AWAY BACK INTO THE GULLY BUT THEY DID NOT FIND MUCH SHELTER THERE RILLS OF WATER BEGAN TO RUN DOWN SOON THEY GREW TO A SPATE THAT SPLASHED AND FUMED ON THE STONES AND SPOUTED OUT OVER THE CLIFF LIKE THE GUTTERS OF A VAST ROOF
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HALF DROWNED DOWN THERE OR WASHED CLEAN OFF SAID FRODO WHAT A PIECE OF LUCK YOU HAD THAT ROPE
BETTER LUCK IF ID THOUGHT OF IT SOONER SAID SAM MAYBE YOU REMEMBER THEM PUTTING THE ROPES IN THE BOATS AS WE STARTED OFF IN THE ELVISH COUNTRY I TOOK A FANCY TO IT AND I STOWED A COIL IN MY PACK YEARS AGO IT SEEMS IT MAY BE A HELP IN MANY NEEDS HE SAID HALDIR OR ONE OF THOSE FOLK AND HE SPOKE RIGHT
A PITY I DIDNT THINK OF BRINGING ANOTHER LENGTH SAID FRODO BUT I LEFT THE COMPANY IN SUCH A HURRY AND CONFUSION IF ONLY WE HAD ENOUGH WE COULD USE IT TO GET DOWN HOW LONG IS YOUR ROPE I WONDER
SAM PAID IT OUT SLOWLY MEASURING IT WITH HIS ARMS FIVE TEN TWENTY THIRTY ELLS MORE OR LESS HE SAID
WHOD HAVE THOUGHT IT FRODO EXCLAIMED
AH WHO WOULD SAID SAM ELVES ARE WONDERFUL FOLK IT LOOKS A BIT THIN BUT ITS TOUGH AND SOFT AS MILK TO THE HAND PACKS CLOSE TOO AND AS LIGHT AS LIGHT WONDERFUL FOLK TO BE SURE
THIRTY ELLS SAID FRODO CONSIDERING I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ENOUGH IF THE STORM PASSES BEFORE NIGHTFALL IM GOING TO TRY IT
THE RAINS NEARLY GIVEN OVER ALREADY SAID SAM BUT DONT YOU GO DOING ANYTHING RISKY IN THE DIM AGAIN MR FRODO AND I HAVENT GOT OVER THAT SHRIEK ON THE WIND YET IF YOU HAVE LIKE A BLACK RIDER IT SOUNDED  BUT ONE UP IN THE AIR IF THEY CAN FLY IM THINKING WED BEST LAY UP IN THIS CRACK TILL NIGHTS OVER
AND IM THINKING THAT I WONT SPEND A MOMENT LONGER THAN I NEED STUCK UP ON THIS EDGE WITH THE EYES OF THE DARK COUNTRY LOOKING OVER THE MARSHES SAID FRODO
WITH THAT HE STOOD UP AND WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GULLY AGAIN HE LOOKED OUT CLEAR SKY WAS GROWING IN THE EAST ONCE MORE THE SKIRTS OF THE STORM WERE LIFTING RAGGED AND WET AND THE MAIN BATTLE HAD PASSED TO SPREAD ITS GREAT WINGS OVER THE EMYN MUIL UPON WHICH THE DARK THOUGHT OF SAURON BROODED FOR A WHILE THENCE IT TURNED SMITING THE VALE OF ANDUIN WITH HAIL AND LIGHTNING AND CASTING ITS SHADOW UPON MINAS TIRITH WITH THREAT OF WAR THEN LOWERING IN THE MOUNTAINS AND GATHERING ITS GREAT SPIRES IT ROLLED ON SLOWLY OVER GONDOR AND THE SKIRTS OF ROHAN UNTIL FAR AWAY THE RIDERS ON THE PLAIN SAW ITS BLACK TOWERS MOVING BEHIND THE SUN AS THEY RODE INTO THE WEST BUT HERE OVER THE DESERT AND THE REEKING MARSHES THE DEEP BLUE SKY OF EVENING OPENED ONCE MORE AND A FEW PALLID STARS APPEARED LIKE SMALL WHITE HOLES IN THE CANOPY ABOVE THE CRESCENT MOON
ITS GOOD TO BE ABLE TO SEE AGAIN SAID FRODO BREATHING DEEP DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT FOR A BIT THAT I HAD LOST MY SIGHT FROM THE LIGHTNING OR SOMETHING ELSE WORSE I COULD SEE NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL UNTIL THE GREY ROPE CAME DOWN IT SEEMED TO SHIMMER SOMEHOW
IT DOES LOOK SORT OF SILVER IN THE DARK SAID SAM NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE THOUGH I CANT REMEMBER AS IVE EVER HAD IT OUT SINCE I FIRST STOWED IT BUT IF YOURE SO SET ON CLIMBING MR FRODO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO USE IT THIRTY ELLS OR SAY ABOUT EIGHTEEN FATHOM THATS NO MORE THAN YOUR GUESS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE CLIFF
FRODO THOUGHT FOR A WHILE MAKE IT FAST TO THAT STUMP SAM HE SAID THEN I THINK YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH THIS TIME AND GO FIRST ILL LOWER YOU AND YOU NEED DO NO MORE THAN USE YOUR FEET AND HANDS TO FEND YOURSELF OFF THE ROCK THOUGH IF YOU PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON SOME OF THE LEDGES AND GIVE ME A REST IT WILL HELP WHEN YOURE DOWN ILL FOLLOW I FEEL QUITE MYSELF AGAIN NOW
VERY WELL SAID SAM HEAVILY IF IT MUST BE LETS GET IT OVER HE TOOK UP THE ROPE AND MADE IT FAST OVER THE STUMP NEAREST TO THE BRINK THEN THE OTHER END HE TIED ABOUT HIS OWN WAIST RELUCTANTLY HE TURNED AND PREPARED TO GO OVER THE EDGE A SECOND TIME
IT DID NOT HOWEVER TURN OUT HALF AS BAD AS HE HAD EXPECTED THE ROPE SEEMED TO GIVE HIM CONFIDENCE THOUGH HE SHUT HIS EYES MORE THAN ONCE WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN BETWEEN HIS FEET THERE WAS ONE AWKWARD SPOT WHERE THERE WAS NO LEDGE AND THE WALL WAS SHEER AND EVEN UNDERCUT FOR A SHORT SPACE THERE HE SLIPPED AND SWUNG OUT ON THE SILVER LINE BUT FRODO LOWERED HIM SLOWLY AND STEADILY AND IT WAS OVER AT LAST HIS CHIEF FEAR HAD BEEN THAT THE ROPELENGTH WOULD GIVE OUT WHILE HE WAS STILL HIGH UP BUT THERE WAS STILL A GOOD BIGHT IN FRODOS HANDS WHEN SAM CAME TO THE BOTTOM AND CALLED UP IM DOWN HIS VOICE CAME UP CLEARLY FROM BELOW BUT FRODO COULD NOT SEE HIM HIS GREY ELVENCLOAK HAD MELTED INTO THE TWILIGHT
FRODO TOOK RATHER MORE TIME TO FOLLOW HIM HE HAD THE ROPE ABOUT HIS WAIST AND IT WAS FAST ABOVE AND HE HAD SHORTENED IT SO THAT IT WOULD PULL HIM UP BEFORE HE REACHED THE GROUND STILL HE DID NOT WANT TO RISK A FALL AND HE HAD NOT QUITE SAMS FAITH IN THIS SLENDER GREY LINE HE FOUND TWO PLACES ALL THE SAME WHERE HE HAD TO TRUST WHOLLY TO IT SMOOTH SURFACES WHERE THERE WAS NO HOLD EVEN FOR HIS STRONG HOBBIT FINGERS AND THE LEDGES WERE FAR APART BUT AT LAST HE TOO WAS DOWN
WELL HE CRIED WEVE DONE IT WEVE ESCAPED FROM THE EMYN MUIL AND NOW WHAT NEXT I WONDER MAYBE WE SHALL SOON BE SIGHING FOR GOOD HARD ROCK UNDER FOOT AGAIN
BUT SAM DID NOT ANSWER HE WAS STARING BACK UP THE CLIFF NINNYHAMMERS HE SAID NOODLES MY BEAUTIFUL ROPE THERE IT IS TIED TO A STUMP AND WERE AT THE BOTTOM JUST AS NICE A LITTLE STAIR FOR THAT SLINKING GOLLUM AS WE COULD LEAVE BETTER PUT UP A SIGNPOST TO SAY WHICH WAY WEVE GONE I THOUGHT IT SEEMED A BIT TOO EASY
IF YOU CAN THINK OF ANY WAY WE COULD HAVE BOTH USED THE ROPE AND YET BROUGHT IT DOWN WITH US THEN YOU CAN PASS ON TO ME NINNYHAMMER OR ANY OTHER NAME YOUR GAFFER GAVE YOU SAID FRODO CLIMB UP AND UNTIE IT AND LET YOURSELF DOWN IF YOU WANT TO
SAM SCRATCHED HIS HEAD NO I CANT THINK HOW BEGGING YOUR PARDON HE SAID BUT I DONT LIKE LEAVING IT AND THATS A FACT HE STROKED THE ROPES END AND SHOOK IT GENTLY IT GOES HARD PARTING WITH ANYTHING I BROUGHT OUT OF THE ELFCOUNTRY MADE BY GALADRIEL HERSELF TOO MAYBE GALADRIEL HE MURMURED NODDING HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY HE LOOKED UP AND GAVE ONE LAST PULL TO THE ROPE AS IF IN FAREWELL
TO THE COMPLETE SURPRISE OF BOTH THE HOBBITS IT CAME LOOSE SAM FELL OVER AND THE LONG GREY COILS SLITHERED SILENTLY DOWN ON TOP OF HIM FRODO LAUGHED WHO TIED THE ROPE HE SAID A GOOD THING IT HELD AS LONG AS IT DID TO THINK THAT I TRUSTED ALL MY WEIGHT TO YOUR KNOT
SAM DID NOT LAUGH I MAY NOT BE MUCH GOOD AT CLIMBING MR FRODO HE SAID IN INJURED TONES BUT I DO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ROPE AND ABOUT KNOTS ITS IN THE FAMILY AS YOU MIGHT SAY WHY MY GRANDDAD AND MY UNCLE ANDY AFTER HIM HIM THAT WAS THE GAFFERS ELDEST BROTHER HE HAD A ROPEWALK OVER BY TIGHFIELD MANY A YEAR AND I PUT AS FAST A HITCH OVER THE STUMP AS ANY ONE COULD HAVE DONE IN THE SHIRE OR OUT OF IT
THEN THE ROPE MUST HAVE BROKEN  FRAYED ON THE ROCKEDGE I EXPECT SAID FRODO
I BET IT DIDNT SAID SAM IN AN EVEN MORE INJURED VOICE HE STOOPED AND EXAMINED THE ENDS NOR IT HASNT NEITHER NOT A STRAND
THEN IM AFRAID IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE KNOT SAID FRODO
SAM SHOOK HIS HEAD AND DID NOT ANSWER HE WAS PASSING THE ROPE THROUGH HIS FINGERS THOUGHTFULLY HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY MR FRODO HE SAID AT LAST BUT I THINK THE ROPE CAME OFF ITSELF  WHEN I CALLED HE COILED IT UP AND STOWED IT LOVINGLY IN HIS PACK
IT CERTAINLY CAME SAID FRODO AND THATS THE CHIEF THING BUT NOW WEVE GOT TO THINK OF OUR NEXT MOVE NIGHT WILL BE ON US SOON HOW BEAUTIFUL THE STARS ARE AND THE MOON
THEY DO CHEER THE HEART DONT THEY SAID SAM LOOKING UP ELVISH THEY ARE SOMEHOW AND THE MOONS GROWING WE HAVENT SEEN HIM FOR A NIGHT OR TWO IN THIS CLOUDY WEATHER HES BEGINNING TO GIVE QUITE A LIGHT
YES SAID FRODO BUT HE WONT BE FULL FOR SOME DAYS I DONT THINK WELL TRY THE MARSHES BY THE LIGHT OF HALF A MOON
UNDER THE FIRST SHADOWS OF NIGHT THEY STARTED OUT ON THE NEXT STAGE OF THEIR JOURNEY AFTER A WHILE SAM TURNED AND LOOKED BACK AT THE WAY THEY HAD COME THE MOUTH OF THE GULLY WAS A BLACK NOTCH IN THE DIM CLIFF IM GLAD WEVE GOT THE ROPE HE SAID WEVE SET A LITTLE PUZZLE FOR THAT FOOTPAD ANYHOW HE CAN TRY HIS NASTY FLAPPY FEET ON THOSE LEDGES
THEY PICKED THEIR STEPS AWAY FROM THE SKIRTS OF THE CLIFF AMONG A WILDERNESS OF BOULDERS AND ROUGH STONES WET AND SLIPPERY WITH THE HEAVY RAIN THE GROUND STILL FELL AWAY SHARPLY THEY HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR WHEN THEY CAME UPON A GREAT FISSURE THAT YAWNED SUDDENLY BLACK BEFORE THEIR FEET IT WAS NOT WIDE BUT IT WAS TOO WIDE TO JUMP ACROSS IN THE DIM LIGHT THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD HEAR WATER GURGLING IN ITS DEPTHS IT CURVED AWAY ON THEIR LEFT NORTHWARD BACK TOWARDS THE HILLS AND SO BARRED THEIR ROAD IN THAT DIRECTION AT ANY RATE WHILE DARKNESS LASTED
WE HAD BETTER TRY A WAY BACK SOUTHWARDS ALONG THE LINE OF THE CLIFF I THINK SAID SAM WE MIGHT FIND SOME NOOK THERE OR EVEN A CAVE OR SOMETHING
I SUPPOSE SO SAID FRODO IM TIRED AND I DONT THINK I CAN SCRAMBLE AMONG STONES MUCH LONGER TONIGHT  THOUGH I GRUDGE THE DELAY I WISH THERE WAS A CLEAR PATH IN FRONT OF US THEN ID GO ON TILL MY LEGS GAVE WAY
THEY DID NOT FIND THE GOING ANY EASIER AT THE BROKEN FEET OF THE EMYN MUIL NOR DID SAM FIND ANY NOOK OR HOLLOW TO SHELTER IN ONLY BARE STONY SLOPES FROWNED OVER BY THE CLIFF WHICH NOW ROSE AGAIN HIGHER AND MORE SHEER AS THEY WENT BACK IN THE END WORN OUT THEY JUST CAST THEMSELVES ON THE GROUND UNDER THE LEE OF A BOULDER LYING NOT FAR FROM THE FOOT OF THE PRECIPICE THERE FOR SOME TIME THEY SAT HUDDLED MOURNFULLY TOGETHER IN THE COLD STONY NIGHT WHILE SLEEP CREPT UPON THEM IN SPITE OF ALL THEY COULD DO TO HOLD IT OFF THE MOON NOW RODE HIGH AND CLEAR ITS THIN WHITE LIGHT LIT UP THE FACES OF THE ROCKS AND DRENCHED THE COLD FROWNING WALLS OF THE CLIFF TURNING ALL THE WIDE LOOMING DARKNESS INTO A CHILL PALE GREY SCORED WITH BLACK SHADOWS
WELL SAID FRODO STANDING UP AND DRAWING HIS CLOAK MORE CLOSELY ROUND HIM YOU SLEEP FOR A BIT SAM AND TAKE MY BLANKET ILL WALK UP AND DOWN ON SENTRY FOR A WHILE SUDDENLY HE STIFFENED AND STOOPING HE GRIPPED SAM BY THE ARM WHATS THAT HE WHISPERED LOOK OVER THERE ON THE CLIFF
SAM LOOKED AND BREATHED IN SHARPLY THROUGH HIS TEETH SSSS HE SAID THATS WHAT IT IS ITS THAT GOLLUM SNAKES AND LADDERS AND TO THINK THAT I THOUGHT THAT WED PUZZLE HIM WITH OUR BIT OF A CLIMB LOOK AT HIM LIKE A NASTY CRAWLING SPIDER ON A WALL
DOWN THE FACE OF A PRECIPICE SHEER AND ALMOST SMOOTH IT SEEMED IN THE PALE MOONLIGHT A SMALL BLACK SHAPE WAS MOVING WITH ITS THIN LIMBS SPLAYED OUT MAYBE ITS SOFT CLINGING HANDS AND TOES WERE FINDING CREVICES AND HOLDS THAT NO HOBBIT COULD EVER HAVE SEEN OR USED BUT IT LOOKED AS IF IT WAS JUST CREEPING DOWN ON STICKY PADS LIKE SOME LARGE PROWLING THING OF INSECTKIND AND IT WAS COMING DOWN HEAD FIRST AS IF IT WAS SMELLING ITS WAY NOW AND AGAIN IT LIFTED ITS HEAD SLOWLY TURNING IT RIGHT BACK ON ITS LONG SKINNY NECK AND THE HOBBITS CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF TWO SMALL PALE GLEAMING LIGHTS ITS EYES THAT BLINKED AT THE MOON FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WERE QUICKLY LIDDED AGAIN

CAREFUL WHISPERED FRODO COMING BEHIND DONT ALARM HIM HES MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN HE LOOKS
THE BLACK CRAWLING SHAPE WAS NOW THREEQUARTERS OF THE WAY DOWN AND PERHAPS FIFTY FEET OR LESS ABOVE THE CLIFFS FOOT CROUCHING STONESTILL IN THE SHADOW OF A LARGE BOULDER THE HOBBITS WATCHED HIM HE SEEMED TO HAVE COME TO A DIFFICULT PASSAGE OR TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT SOMETHING THEY COULD HEAR HIM SNUFFLING AND NOW AND AGAIN THERE WAS A HARSH HISS OF BREATH THAT SOUNDED LIKE A CURSE HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD HIM SPIT THEN HE MOVED ON AGAIN NOW THEY COULD HEAR HIS VOICE CREAKING AND WHISTLING

AT LAST HE WAS NO MORE THAN A DOZEN FEET FROM THE GROUND RIGHT ABOVE THEIR HEADS FROM THAT POINT THERE WAS A SHEER DROP FOR THE CLIFF WAS SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT AND EVEN GOLLUM COULD NOT FIND A HOLD OF ANY KIND HE SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO TWIST ROUND SO AS TO GO LEGS FIRST WHEN SUDDENLY WITH A SHRILL WHISTLING SHRIEK HE FELL AS HE DID SO HE CURLED HIS LEGS AND ARMS UP ROUND HIM LIKE A SPIDER WHOSE DESCENDING THREAD IS SNAPPED
SAM WAS OUT OF HIS HIDING IN A FLASH AND CROSSED THE SPACE BETWEEN HIM AND THE CLIFF FOOT IN A COUPLE OF LEAPS BEFORE GOLLUM COULD GET UP HE WAS ON TOP OF HIM BUT HE FOUND GOLLUM MORE THAN HE BARGAINED FOR EVEN TAKEN LIKE THAT SUDDENLY OFF HIS GUARD AFTER A FALL BEFORE SAM COULD GET A HOLD LONG LEGS AND ARMS WERE WOUND ROUND HIM PINNING HIS ARMS AND A CLINGING GRIP SOFT BUT HORRIBLY STRONG WAS SQUEEZING HIM LIKE SLOWLY TIGHTENING CORDS CLAMMY FINGERS WERE FEELING FOR HIS THROAT THEN SHARP TEETH BIT INTO HIS SHOULDER ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO BUTT HIS HARD ROUND HEAD SIDEWAYS INTO THE CREATURES FACE GOLLUM HISSED AND SPAT BUT HE DID NOT LET GO

IN THE DEEP OF NIGHT UNDER HARD CLEAR STARS THEY SET OFF GOLLUM LED THEM BACK NORTHWARD FOR A WHILE ALONG THE WAY THEY HAD COME THEN HE SLANTED TO THE RIGHT AWAY FROM THE STEEP EDGE OF THE EMYN MUIL DOWN THE BROKEN STONY SLOPES TOWARDS THE VAST FENS BELOW THEY FADED SWIFTLY AND SOFTLY INTO THE DARKNESS OVER ALL THE LEAGUES OF WASTE BEFORE THE GATES OF MORDOR THERE WAS A BLACK SILENCE



CHAPTER 2
THE PASSAGE OF THE MARSHES

GOLLUM MOVED QUICKLY WITH HIS HEAD AND NECK THRUST FORWARD OFTEN USING HIS HANDS AS WELL AS HIS FEET FRODO AND SAM WERE HARD PUT TO IT TO KEEP UP WITH HIM BUT HE SEEMED NO LONGER TO HAVE ANY THOUGHT OF ESCAPING AND IF THEY FELL BEHIND HE WOULD TURN AND WAIT FOR THEM AFTER A TIME HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE BRINK OF THE NARROW GULLY THAT THEY HAD STRUCK BEFORE BUT THEY WERE NOW FURTHER FROM THE HILLS
HERE IT IS HE CRIED THERE IS A WAY DOWN INSIDE YES NOW WE FOLLOWS IT  OUT OUT AWAY OVER THERE HE POINTED SOUTH AND EAST TOWARDS THE MARSHES THE REEK OF THEM CAME TO THEIR NOSTRILS HEAVY AND FOUL EVEN IN THE COOL NIGHT AIR
GOLLUM CAST UP AND DOWN ALONG THE BRINK AND AT LENGTH HE CALLED TO THEM HERE WE CAN GET DOWN HERE SMEAGOL WENT THIS WAY ONCE I WENT THIS WAY HIDING FROM ORCS
HE LED THE WAY AND FOLLOWING HIM THE HOBBITS CLIMBED DOWN INTO THE GLOOM IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THE RIFT WAS AT THIS POINT ONLY SOME FIFTEEN FEET DEEP AND ABOUT A DOZEN ACROSS THERE WAS RUNNING WATER AT THE BOTTOM IT WAS IN FACT THE BED OF ONE OF THE MANY SMALL RIVERS THAT TRICKLED DOWN FROM THE HILLS TO FEED THE STAGNANT POOLS AND MIRES BEYOND GOLLUM TURNED TO THE RIGHT SOUTHWARD MORE OR LESS AND SPLASHED ALONG WITH HIS FEET IN THE SHALLOW STONY STREAM HE SEEMED GREATLY DELIGHTED TO FEEL THE WATER AND CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF SOMETIMES EVEN CROAKING IN A SORT OF SONG
THE COLD HARD LANDS
THEY BITES OUR HANDS
THEY GNAWS OUR FEET
THE ROCKS AND STONES
ARE LIKE OLD BONES
ALL BARE OF MEAT
BUT STREAM AND POOL
IS WET AND COOL
SO NICE FOR FEET
AND NOW WE WISH 

HA HA WHAT DOES WE WISH HE SAID LOOKING SIDELONG AT THE HOBBITS WELL TELL YOU HE CROAKED HE GUESSED IT LONG AGO BAGGINS GUESSED IT A GLINT CAME INTO HIS EYES AND SAM CATCHING THE GLEAM IN THE DARKNESS THOUGHT IT FAR FROM PLEASANT
ALIVE WITHOUT BREATH
AS COLD AS DEATH
NEVER THIRSTING EVER DRINKING
CLAD IN MAIL NEVER CLINKING
DROWNS ON DRY LAND
THINKS AN ISLAND
IS A MOUNTAIN
THINKS A FOUNTAIN
IS A PUFF OF AIR
SO SLEEK SO FAIR
WHAT A JOY TO MEET
WE ONLY WISH
TO CATCH A FISH
SO JUICYSWEET

THESE WORDS ONLY MADE MORE PRESSING TO SAMS MIND A PROBLEM THAT HAD BEEN TROUBLING HIM FROM THE MOMENT WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS MASTER WAS GOING TO ADOPT GOLLUM AS A GUIDE THE PROBLEM OF FOOD IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THAT HIS MASTER MIGHT ALSO HAVE THOUGHT OF IT BUT HE SUPPOSED GOLLUM HAD INDEED HOW HAD GOLLUM KEPT HIMSELF IN ALL HIS LONELY WANDERING NOT TOO WELL THOUGHT SAM HE LOOKS FAIR FAMISHED NOT TOO DAINTY TO TRY WHAT HOBBIT TASTES LIKE IF THERE AINT NO FISH ILL WAGER  SUPPOSING AS HE COULD CATCH US NAPPING WELL HE WONT NOT SAM GAMGEE FOR ONE
THEY STUMBLED ALONG IN THE DARK WINDING GULLY FOR A LONG TIME OR SO IT SEEMED TO THE TIRED FEET OF FRODO AND SAM THE GULLY TURNED EASTWARD AND AS THEY WENT ON IT BROADENED AND GOT GRADUALLY SHALLOWER AT LAST THE SKY ABOVE GREW FAINT WITH THE FIRST GREY OF MORNING GOLLUM HAD SHOWN NO SIGNS OF TIRING BUT NOW HE LOOKED UP AND HALTED
DAY IS NEAR HE WHISPERED AS IF DAY WAS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT OVERHEAR HIM AND SPRING ON HIM SMEAGOL WILL STAY HERE I WILL STAY HERE AND THE YELLOW FACE WONT SEE ME
WE SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE THE SUN SAID FRODO BUT WE WILL STAY HERE WE ARE TOO TIRED TO GO ANY FURTHER AT PRESENT
YOU ARE NOT WISE TO BE GLAD OF THE YELLOW FACE SAID GOLLUM IT SHOWS YOU UP NICE SENSIBLE HOBBITS STAY WITH SMEAGOL ORCS AND NASTY THINGS ARE ABOUT THEY CAN SEE A LONG WAY STAY AND HIDE WITH ME
THE THREE OF THEM SETTLED DOWN TO REST AT THE FOOT OF THE ROCKY WALL OF THE GULLY IT WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A TALL MANS HEIGHT NOW AND AT ITS BASE THERE WERE WIDE FLAT SHELVES OF DRY STONE THE WATER RAN IN A CHANNEL ON THE OTHER SIDE FRODO AND SAM SAT ON ONE OF THE FLATS RESTING THEIR BACKS GOLLUM PADDLED AND SCRABBLED IN THE STREAM
WE MUST TAKE A LITTLE FOOD SAID FRODO ARE YOU HUNGRY SMEAGOL WE HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SHARE BUT WE WILL SPARE YOU WHAT WE CAN
AT THE WORD HUNGRY A GREENISH LIGHT WAS KINDLED IN GOLLUMS PALE EYES AND THEY SEEMED TO PROTRUDE FURTHER THAN EVER FROM HIS THIN SICKLY FACE FOR A MOMENT HE RELAPSED INTO HIS OLD GOLLUMMANNER WE ARE FAMISSHED YES FAMISSHED WE ARE PRECIOUS HE SAID WHAT IS IT THEY EATS HAVE THEY NICE FISSHES HIS TONGUE LOLLED OUT BETWEEN HIS SHARP YELLOW TEETH LICKING HIS COLOURLESS LIPS
NO WE HAVE GOT NO FISH SAID FRODO WE HAVE ONLY GOT THIS  HE HELD UP A WAFER OF LEMBAS  AND WATER IF THE WATER HERE IS FIT TO DRINK
YESS YESS NICE WATER SAID GOLLUM DRINK IT DRINK IT WHILE WE CAN BUT WHAT IS IT THEYVE GOT PRECIOUS IS IT CRUNCHABLE IS IT TASTY
FRODO BROKE OFF A PORTION OF A WAFER AND HANDED IT TO HIM ON ITS LEAFWRAPPING GOLLUM SNIFFED AT THE LEAF AND HIS FACE CHANGED A SPASM OF DISGUST CAME OVER IT AND A HINT OF HIS OLD MALICE SMEAGOL SMELLS IT HE SAID LEAVES OUT OF THE ELFCOUNTRY GAH THEY STINKS HE CLIMBED IN THOSE TREES AND HE COULDNT WASH THE SMELL OFF HIS HANDS MY NICE HANDS DROPPING THE LEAF HE TOOK A CORNER OF THE LEMBAS AND NIBBLED IT HE SPAT AND A FIT OF COUGHING SHOOK HIM
ACH NO HE SPLUTTERED YOU TRY TO CHOKE POOR SMEAGOL DUST AND ASHES HE CANT EAT THAT HE MUST STARVE BUT SMEAGOL DOESNT MIND NICE HOBBITS SMEAGOL HAS PROMISED HE WILL STARVE HE CANT EAT HOBBITS FOOD HE WILL STARVE POOR THIN SMEAGOL
IM SORRY SAID FRODO BUT I CANT HELP YOU IM AFRAID I THINK THIS FOOD WOULD DO YOU GOOD IF YOU WOULD TRY BUT PERHAPS YOU CANT EVEN TRY NOT YET ANYWAY
THE HOBBITS MUNCHED THEIR LEMBAS IN SILENCE SAM THOUGHT THAT IT TASTED FAR BETTER SOMEHOW THAN IT HAD FOR A GOOD WHILE GOLLUMS BEHAVIOUR HAD MADE HIM ATTEND TO ITS FLAVOUR AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE GOLLUM WATCHED EVERY MORSEL FROM HAND TO MOUTH LIKE AN EXPECTANT DOG BY A DINERS CHAIR ONLY WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED AND WERE PREPARING TO REST WAS HE APPARENTLY CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD NO HIDDEN DAINTIES THAT HE COULD SHARE IN THEN HE WENT AND SAT BY HIMSELF A FEW PACES AWAY AND WHIMPERED A LITTLE
LOOK HERE SAM WHISPERED TO FRODO NOT TOO SOFTLY HE DID NOT REALLY CARE WHETHER GOLLUM HEARD HIM OR NOT WEVE GOT TO GET SOME SLEEP BUT NOT BOTH TOGETHER WITH THAT HUNGRY VILLAIN NIGH PROMISE OR NO PROMISE SMEAGOL OR GOLLUM HE WONT CHANGE HIS HABITS IN A HURRY ILL WARRANT YOU GO TO SLEEP MR FRODO AND ILL CALL YOU WHEN I CANT KEEP MY EYELIDS PROPPED UP TURN AND ABOUT SAME AS BEFORE WHILE HES LOOSE

SO TIRED WAS FRODO THAT HIS HEAD FELL FORWARD ON HIS BREAST AND HE SLEPT ALMOST AS SOON AS HE HAD SPOKEN THE WORDS GOLLUM SEEMED NO LONGER TO HAVE ANY FEARS HE CURLED UP AND WENT QUICKLY TO SLEEP QUITE UNCONCERNED PRESENTLY HIS BREATH WAS HISSING SOFTLY THROUGH HIS CLENCHED TEETH BUT HE LAY STILL AS STONE AFTER A WHILE FEARING THAT HE WOULD DROP OFF HIMSELF IF HE SAT LISTENING TO HIS TWO COMPANIONS BREATHING SAM GOT UP AND GENTLY PRODDED GOLLUM HIS HANDS UNCURLED AND TWITCHED BUT HE MADE NO OTHER MOVEMENT SAM BENT DOWN AND SAID FISSH CLOSE TO HIS EAR BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE NOT EVEN A CATCH IN GOLLUMS BREATHING
SAM SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MUST REALLY BE ASLEEP HE MUTTERED AND IF I WAS LIKE GOLLUM HE WOULDNT WAKE UP NEVER AGAIN HE RESTRAINED THE THOUGHTS OF HIS SWORD AND THE ROPE THAT SPRANG TO HIS MIND AND WENT AND SAT DOWN BY HIS MASTER
WHEN HE WOKE UP THE SKY ABOVE WAS DIM NOT LIGHTER BUT DARKER THAN WHEN THEY HAD BREAKFASTED SAM LEAPT TO HIS FEET NOT LEAST FROM HIS OWN FEELING OF VIGOUR AND HUNGER HE SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD SLEPT THE DAYLIGHT AWAY NINE HOURS AT LEAST FRODO WAS STILL FAST ASLEEP LYING NOW STRETCHED ON HIS SIDE GOLLUM WAS NOT TO BE SEEN VARIOUS REPROACHFUL NAMES FOR HIMSELF CAME TO SAMS MIND DRAWN FROM THE GAFFERS LARGE PATERNAL WORDHOARD THEN IT ALSO OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS MASTER HAD BEEN RIGHT THERE HAD FOR THE PRESENT BEEN NOTHING TO GUARD AGAINST THEY WERE AT ANY RATE BOTH ALIVE AND UNTHROTTLED

SAM NODDED SILENTLY HE TOOK HIS MASTERS HAND AND BENT OVER IT HE DID NOT KISS IT THOUGH HIS TEARS FELL ON IT THEN HE TURNED AWAY DREW HIS SLEEVE OVER HIS NOSE AND GOT UP AND STAMPED ABOUT TRYING TO WHISTLE AND SAYING BETWEEN THE EFFORTS WHERES THAT DRATTED CREATURE
IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT LONG BEFORE GOLLUM RETURNED BUT HE CAME SO QUIETLY THAT THEY DID NOT HEAR HIM TILL HE STOOD BEFORE THEM HIS FINGERS AND FACE WERE SOILED WITH BLACK MUD HE WAS STILL CHEWING AND SLAVERING WHAT HE WAS CHEWING THEY DID NOT ASK OR LIKE TO THINK
WORMS OR BEETLES OR SOMETHING SLIMY OUT OF HOLES THOUGHT SAM BRR THE NASTY CREATURE THE POOR WRETCH
GOLLUM SAID NOTHING TO THEM UNTIL HE HAD DRUNK DEEPLY AND WASHED HIMSELF IN THE STREAM THEN HE CAME UP TO THEM LICKING HIS LIPS BETTER NOW HE SAID ARE WE RESTED READY TO GO ON NICE HOBBITS THEY SLEEP BEAUTIFULLY TRUST SMEAGOL NOW VERY VERY GOOD
THE NEXT STAGE OF THEIR JOURNEY WAS MUCH THE SAME AS THE LAST AS THEY WENT ON THE GULLY BECAME EVER SHALLOWER AND THE SLOPE OF ITS FLOOR MORE GRADUAL ITS BOTTOM WAS LESS STONY AND MORE EARTHY AND SLOWLY ITS SIDES DWINDLED TO MERE BANKS IT BEGAN TO WIND AND WANDER THAT NIGHT DREW TO ITS END BUT CLOUDS WERE NOW OVER MOON AND STAR AND THEY KNEW OF THE COMING OF DAY ONLY BY THE SLOW SPREADING OF THE THIN GREY LIGHT
IN A CHILL HOUR THEY CAME TO THE END OF THE WATERCOURSE THE BANKS BECAME MOSSGROWN MOUNDS OVER THE LAST SHELF OF ROTTING STONE THE STREAM GURGLED AND FELL DOWN INTO A BROWN BOG AND WAS LOST DRY REEDS HISSED AND RATTLED THOUGH THEY COULD FEEL NO WIND
ON EITHER SIDE AND IN FRONT WIDE FENS AND MIRES NOW LAY STRETCHING AWAY SOUTHWARD AND EASTWARD INTO THE DIM HALFLIGHT MISTS CURLED AND SMOKED FROM DARK AND NOISOME POOLS THE REEK OF THEM HUNG STIFLING IN THE STILL AIR FAR AWAY NOW ALMOST DUE SOUTH THE MOUNTAINWALLS OF MORDOR LOOMED LIKE A BLACK BAR OF RUGGED CLOUDS FLOATING ABOVE A DANGEROUS FOGBOUND SEA
THE HOBBITS WERE NOW WHOLLY IN THE HANDS OF GOLLUM THEY DID NOW KNOW AND COULD NOT GUESS IN THAT MISTY LIGHT THAT THEY WERE IN FACT ONLY JUST WITHIN THE NORTHERN BORDERS OF THE MARSHES THE MAIN EXPANSE OF WHICH LAY SOUTH OF THEM THEY COULD IF THEY HAD KNOWN THE LANDS WITH SOME DELAY HAVE RETRACED THEIR STEPS A LITTLE AND THEN TURNING EAST HAVE COME ROUND OVER HARD ROADS TO THE BARE PLAIN OF DAGORLAD THE FIELD OF THE ANCIENT BATTLE BEFORE THE GATES OF MORDOR NOT THAT THERE WAS GREAT HOPE IN SUCH A COURSE ON THAT STONY PLAIN THERE WAS NO COVER AND ACROSS IT RAN THE HIGHWAYS OF THE ORCS AND THE SOLDIERS OF THE ENEMY NOT EVEN THE CLOAKS OF LORIEN WOULD HAVE CONCEALED THEM THERE
HOW DO WE SHAPE OUR COURSE NOW SMEAGOL ASKED FRODO MUST WE CROSS THESE EVILSMELLING FENS
NO NEED NO NEED AT ALL SAID GOLLUM NOT IF HOBBITS WANT TO REACH THE DARK MOUNTAINS AND GO TO SEE HIM VERY QUICK BACK A LITTLE AND ROUND A LITTLE  HIS SKINNY ARM WAVED NORTH AND EAST  AND YOU CAN COME ON HARD COLD ROADS TO THE VERY GATES OF HIS COUNTRY LOTS OF HIS PEOPLE WILL BE THERE LOOKING OUT FOR GUESTS VERY PLEASED TO TAKE THEM STRAIGHT TO HIM O YES HIS EYE WATCHES THAT WAY ALL THE TIME IT CAUGHT SMEAGOL THERE LONG AGO GOLLUM SHUDDERED BUT SMEAGOL HAS USED HIS EYES SINCE THEN YES YES IVE USED EYES AND FEET AND NOSE SINCE THEN L KNOW OTHER WAYS MORE DIFFICULT NOT SO QUICK BUT BETTER IF WE DONT WANT HIM TO SEE FOLLOW SMEAGOL HE CAN TAKE YOU THROUGH THE MARSHES THROUGH THE MISTS NICE THICK MISTS FOLLOW SMEAGOL VERY CAREFULLY AND YOU MAY GO A LONG WAY QUITE A LONG WAY BEFORE HE CATCHES YOU YES PERHAPS
IT WAS ALREADY DAY A WINDLESS AND SULLEN MORNING AND THE MARSHREEKS LAY IN HEAVY BANKS NO SUN PIERCED THE LOW CLOUDED SKY AND GOLLUM SEEMED ANXIOUS TO CONTINUE THE JOURNEY AT ONCE SO AFTER A BRIEF REST THEY SET OUT AGAIN AND WERE SOON LOST IN A SHADOWY SILENT WORLD CUT OFF FROM ALL VIEW OF THE LANDS ABOUT EITHER THE HILLS THAT THEY HAD LEFT OR THE MOUNTAINS THAT THEY SOUGHT THEY WENT SLOWLY IN SINGLE FILE GOLLUM SAM FRODO
FRODO SEEMED THE MOST WEARY OF THE THREE AND SLOW THOUGH THEY WENT HE OFTEN LAGGED THE HOBBITS SOON FOUND THAT WHAT HAD LOOKED LIKE ONE VAST FEN WAS REALLY AN ENDLESS NETWORK OF POOLS AND SOFT MIRES AND WINDING HALFSTRANGLED WATERCOURSES AMONG THESE A CUNNING EYE AND FOOT COULD THREAD A WANDERING PATH GOLLUM CERTAINLY HAD THAT CUNNING AND NEEDED ALL OF IT HIS HEAD ON ITS LONG NECK WAS EVER TURNING THIS WAY AND THAT WHILE HE SNIFFED AND MUTTERED ALL THE TIME TO HIMSELF SOMETIMES HE WOULD HOLD UP HIS HAND AND HALT THEM WHILE HE WENT FORWARD A LITTLE CROUCHING TESTING THE GROUND WITH FINGERS OR TOES OR MERELY LISTENING WITH ONE EAR PRESSED TO THE EARTH
IT WAS DREARY AND WEARISOME COLD CLAMMY WINTER STILL HELD SWAY IN THIS FORSAKEN COUNTRY THE ONLY GREEN WAS THE SCUM OF LIVID WEED ON THE DARK GREASY SURFACES OF THE SULLEN WATERS DEAD GRASSES AND ROTTING REEDS LOOMED UP IN THE MISTS LIKE RAGGED SHADOWS OF LONGFORGOTTEN SUMMERS
AS THE DAY WORE ON THE LIGHT INCREASED A LITTLE AND THE MISTS LIFTED GROWING THINNER AND MORE TRANSPARENT FAR ABOVE THE ROT AND VAPOURS OF THE WORLD THE SUN WAS RIDING HIGH AND GOLDEN NOW IN A SERENE COUNTRY WITH FLOORS OF DAZZLING FOAM BUT ONLY A PASSING GHOST OF HER COULD THEY SEE BELOW BLEARED PALE GIVING NO COLOUR AND NO WARMTH BUT EVEN AT THIS FAINT REMINDER OF HER PRESENCE GOLLUM SCOWLED AND FLINCHED HE HALTED THEIR JOURNEY AND THEY RESTED SQUATTING LIKE LITTLE HUNTED ANIMALS IN THE BORDERS OF A GREAT BROWN REEDTHICKET THERE WAS A DEEP SILENCE ONLY SCRAPED ON ITS SURFACES BY THE FAINT QUIVER OF EMPTY SEEDPLUMES AND BROKEN GRASSBLADES TREMBLING IN SMALL AIRMOVEMENTS THAT THEY COULD NOT FEEL
NOT A BIRD SAID SAM MOURNFULLY
NO NO BIRDS SAID GOLLUM NICE BIRDS HE LICKED HIS TEETH NO BIRDS HERE THERE ARE SNAKESES WORMSES THINGS IN THE POOLS LOTS OF THINGS LOTS OF NASTY THINGS NO BIRDS HE ENDED SADLY SAM LOOKED AT HIM WITH DISTASTE
SO PASSED THE THIRD DAY OF THEIR JOURNEY WITH GOLLUM BEFORE THE SHADOWS OF EVENING WERE LONG IN HAPPIER LANDS THEY WENT ON AGAIN ALWAYS ON AND ON WITH ONLY BRIEF HALTS THESE THEY MADE NOT SO MUCH FOR REST AS TO HELP GOLLUM FOR NOW EVEN HE HAD TO GO FORWARD WITH GREAT CARE AND HE WAS SOMETIMES AT A LOSS FOR A WHILE THEY HAD COME TO THE VERY MIDST OF THE DEAD MARSHES AND IT WAS DARK
THEY WALKED SLOWLY STOOPING KEEPING CLOSE IN LINE FOLLOWING ATTENTIVELY EVERY MOVE THAT GOLLUM MADE THE FENS GREW MORE WET OPENING INTO WIDE STAGNANT MERES AMONG WHICH IT GREW MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND THE FIRMER PLACES WHERE FEET COULD TREAD WITHOUT SINKING INTO GURGLING MUD THE TRAVELLERS WERE LIGHT OR MAYBE NONE OF THEM WOULD EVER HAVE FOUND A WAY THROUGH
PRESENTLY IT GREW ALTOGETHER DARK THE AIR ITSELF SEEMED BLACK AND HEAVY TO BREATHE WHEN LIGHTS APPEARED SAM RUBBED HIS EYES HE THOUGHT HIS HEAD WAS GOING QUEER HE FIRST SAW ONE WITH THE CORNER OF HIS LEFT EYE A WISP OF PALE SHEEN THAT FADED AWAY BUT OTHERS APPEARED SOON AFTER SOME LIKE DIMLY SHINING SMOKE SOME LIKE MISTY FLAMES FLICKERING SLOWLY ABOVE UNSEEN CANDLES HERE AND THERE THEY TWISTED LIKE GHOSTLY SHEETS UNFURLED BY HIDDEN HANDS BUT NEITHER OF HIS COMPANIONS SPOKE A WORD
AT LAST SAM COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER WHATS ALL THIS GOLLUM HE SAID IN A WHISPER THESE LIGHTS THEYRE ALL ROUND US NOW ARE WE TRAPPED WHO ARE THEY
GOLLUM LOOKED UP A DARK WATER WAS BEFORE HIM AND HE WAS CRAWLING ON THE GROUND THIS WAY AND THAT DOUBTFUL OF THE WAY YES THEY ARE ALL ROUND US HE WHISPERED THE TRICKSY LIGHTS CANDLES OF CORPSES YES YES DONT YOU HEED THEM DONT LOOK DONT FOLLOW THEM WHERES THE MASTER
SAM LOOKED BACK AND FOUND THAT FRODO HAD LAGGED AGAIN HE COULD NOT SEE HIM HE WENT SOME PACES BACK INTO THE DARKNESS NOT DARING TO MOVE FAR OR TO CALL IN MORE THAN A HOARSE WHISPER SUDDENLY HE STUMBLED AGAINST FRODO WHO WAS STANDING LOST IN THOUGHT LOOKING AT THE PALE LIGHTS HIS HANDS HUNG STIFF AT HIS SIDES WATER AND SLIME WERE DRIPPING FROM THEM
COME MR FRODO SAID SAM DONT LOOK AT THEM GOLLUM SAYS WE MUSTNT LETS KEEP UP WITH HIM AND GET OUT OF THIS CURSED PLACE AS QUICK AS WE CAN  IF WE CAN
ALL RIGHT SAID FRODO AS IF RETURNING OUT OF A DREAM IM COMING GO ON
HURRYING FORWARD AGAIN SAM TRIPPED CATCHING HIS FOOT IN SOME OLD ROOT OR TUSSOCK HE FELL AND CAME HEAVILY ON HIS HANDS WHICH SANK DEEP INTO STICKY OOZE SO THAT HIS FACE WAS BROUGHT CLOSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE DARK MERE THERE WAS A FAINT HISS A NOISOME SMELL WENT UP THE LIGHTS FLICKERED AND DANCED AND SWIRLED FOR A MOMENT THE WATER BELOW HIM LOOKED LIKE SOME WINDOW GLAZED WITH GRIMY GLASS THROUGH WHICH HE WAS PEERING WRENCHING HIS HANDS OUT OF THE BOG HE SPRANG BACK WITH A CRY THERE ARE DEAD THINGS DEAD FACES IN THE WATER HE SAID WITH HORROR DEAD FACES
GOLLUM LAUGHED THE DEAD MARSHES YES YES THAT IS THEIR NAMES HE CACKLED YOU SHOULD NOT LOOK IN WHEN THE CANDLES ARE LIT
WHO ARE THEY WHAT ARE THEY ASKED SAM SHUDDERING TURNING TO FRODO WHO WAS NOW BEHIND HIM
I DONT KNOW SAID FRODO IN A DREAMLIKE VOICE BUT I HAVE SEEN THEM TOO IN THE POOLS WHEN THE CANDLES WERE LIT THEY LIE IN ALL THE POOLS PALE FACES DEEP DEEP UNDER THE DARK WATER I SAW THEM GRIM FACES AND EVIL AND NOBLE FACES AND SAD MANY FACES PROUD AND FAIR AND WEEDS IN THEIR SILVER HAIR BUT ALL FOUL ALL ROTTING ALL DEAD A FELL LIGHT IS IN THEM FRODO HID HIS EYES IN HIS HANDS I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE BUT I THOUGHT I SAW THERE MEN AND ELVES AND ORCS BESIDE THEM
YES YES SAID GOLLUM ALL DEAD ALL ROTTEN ELVES AND MEN AND ORCS THE DEAD MARSHES THERE WAS A GREAT BATTLE LONG AGO YES SO THEY TOLD HIM WHEN SMEAGOL WAS YOUNG WHEN I WAS YOUNG BEFORE THE PRECIOUS CAME IT WAS A GREAT BATTLE TALL MEN WITH LONG SWORDS AND TERRIBLE ELVES AND ORCSES SHRIEKING THEY FOUGHT ON THE PLAIN FOR DAYS AND MONTHS AT THE BLACK GATES BUT THE MARSHES HAVE GROWN SINCE THEN SWALLOWED UP THE GRAVES ALWAYS CREEPING CREEPING
BUT THAT IS AN AGE AND MORE AGO SAID SAM THE DEAD CANT BE REALLY THERE IS IT SOME DEVILRY HATCHED IN THE DARK LAND
WHO KNOWS SMEAGOL DOESNT KNOW ANSWERED GOLLUM YOU CANNOT REACH THEM YOU CANNOT TOUCH THEM WE TRIED ONCE YES PRECIOUS I TRIED ONCE BUT YOU CANNOT REACH THEM ONLY SHAPES TO SEE PERHAPS NOT TO TOUCH NO PRECIOUS ALL DEAD
SAM LOOKED DARKLY AT HIM AND SHUDDERED AGAIN THINKING THAT HE GUESSED WHY SMEAGOL HAD TRIED TO TOUCH THEM WELL I DONT WANT TO SEE THEM HE SAID NEVER AGAIN CANT WE GET ON AND GET AWAY
YES YES SAID GOLLUM BUT SLOWLY VERY SLOWLY VERY CAREFULLY OR HOBBITS GO DOWN TO JOIN THE DEAD ONES AND LIGHT LITTLE CANDLES FOLLOW SMEAGOL DONT LOOK AT LIGHTS
HE CRAWLED AWAY TO THE RIGHT SEEKING FOR A PATH ROUND THE MERE THEY CAME CLOSE BEHIND STOOPING OFTEN USING THEIR HANDS EVEN AS HE DID THREE PRECIOUS LITTLE GOLLUMS IN A ROW WE SHALL BE IF THIS GOES ON MUCH LONGER THOUGHT SAM
AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE END OF THE BLACK MERE AND THEY CROSSED IT PERILOUSLY CRAWLING OR HOPPING FROM ONE TREACHEROUS ISLAND TUSSOCK TO ANOTHER OFTEN THEY FLOUNDERED STEPPING OR FALLING HANDSFIRST INTO WATERS AS NOISOME AS A CESSPOOL TILL THEY WERE SLIMED AND FOULED ALMOST UP TO THEIR NECKS AND STANK IN ONE ANOTHERS NOSTRILS
IT WAS LATE IN THE NIGHT WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED FIRMER GROUND AGAIN GOLLUM HISSED AND WHISPERED TO HIMSELF BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE WAS PLEASED IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY BY SOME BLENDED SENSE OF FEEL AND SMELL AND UNCANNY MEMORY FOR SHAPES IN THE DARK HE SEEMED TO KNOW JUST WHERE HE WAS AGAIN AND TO BE SURE OF HIS ROAD AHEAD
NOW ON WE GO HE SAID NICE HOBBITS BRAVE HOBBITS VERY VERY WEARY OF COURSE SO WE ARE MY PRECIOUS ALL OF US BUT WE MUST TAKE MASTER AWAY FROM THE WICKED LIGHTS YES YES WE MUST WITH THESE WORDS HE STARTED OFF AGAIN ALMOST AT A TROT DOWN WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LONG LANE BETWEEN HIGH REEDS AND THEY STUMBLED AFTER HIM AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND SNIFFED THE AIR DOUBTFULLY HISSING AS IF HE WAS TROUBLED OR DISPLEASED AGAIN
WHAT IS IT GROWLED SAM MISINTERPRETING THE SIGNS WHATS THE NEED TO SNIFF THE STINK NEARLY KNOCKS ME DOWN WITH MY NOSE HELD YOU STINK AND MASTER STINKS THE WHOLE PLACE STINKS
YES YES AND SAM STINKS ANSWERED GOLLUM POOR SMEAGOL SMELLS IT BUT GOOD SMEAGOL BEARS IT HELPS NICE MASTER BUT THATS NO MATTER THE AIRS MOVING CHANGE IS COMING SMEAGOL WONDERS HES NOT HAPPY
HE WENT ON AGAIN BUT HIS UNEASINESS GREW AND EVERY NOW AND AGAIN HE STOOD UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT CRANING HIS NECK EASTWARD AND SOUTHWARD FOR SOME TIME THE HOBBITS COULD NOT HEAR OR FEEL WHAT WAS TROUBLING HIM THEN SUDDENLY ALL THREE HALTED STIFFENING AND LISTENING TO FRODO AND SAM IT SEEMED THAT THEY HEARD FAR AWAY A LONG WAILING CRY HIGH AND THIN AND CRUEL THEY SHIVERED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE STIRRING OF THE AIR BECAME PERCEPTIBLE TO THEM AND IT GREW VERY COLD AS THEY STOOD STRAINING THEIR EARS THEY HEARD A NOISE LIKE A WIND COMING IN THE DISTANCE THE MISTY LIGHTS WAVERED DIMMED AND WENT OUT
GOLLUM WOULD NOT MOVE HE STOOD SHAKING AND GIBBERING TO HIMSELF UNTIL WITH A RUSH THE WIND CAME UPON THEM HISSING AND SNARLING OVER THE MARSHES THE NIGHT BECAME LESS DARK LIGHT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO SEE OR HALF SEE SHAPELESS DRIFTS OF FOG CURLING AND TWISTING AS IT ROLLED OVER THEM AND PASSED THEM LOOKING UP THEY SAW THE CLOUDS BREAKING AND SHREDDING AND THEN HIGH IN THE SOUTH THE MOON GLIMMERED OUT RIDING IN THE FLYING WRACK
FOR A MOMENT THE SIGHT OF IT GLADDENED THE HEARTS OF THE HOBBITS BUT GOLLUM COWERED DOWN MUTTERING CURSES ON THE WHITE FACE THEN FRODO AND SAM STARING AT THE SKY BREATHING DEEPLY OF THE FRESHER AIR SAW IT COME A SMALL CLOUD FLYING FROM THE ACCURSED HILLS A BLACK SHADOW LOOSED FROM MORDOR A VAST SHAPE WINGED AND OMINOUS IT SCUDDED ACROSS THE MOON AND WITH A DEADLY CRY WENT AWAY WESTWARD OUTRUNNING THE WIND IN ITS FELL SPEED
THEY FELL FORWARD GROVELLING HEEDLESSLY ON THE COLD EARTH BUT THE SHADOW OF HORROR WHEELED AND RETURNED PASSING LOWER NOW RIGHT ABOVE THEM SWEEPING THE FENREEK WITH ITS GHASTLY WINGS AND THEN IT WAS GONE FLYING BACK TO MORDOR WITH THE SPEED OF THE WRATH OF SAURON AND BEHIND IT THE WIND ROARED AWAY LEAVING THE DEAD MARSHES BARE AND BLEAK THE NAKED WASTE AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD PIERCE EVEN TO THE DISTANT MENACE OF THE MOUNTAINS WAS DAPPLED WITH THE FITFUL MOONLIGHT
FRODO AND SAM GOT UP RUBBING THEIR EYES LIKE CHILDREN WAKENED FROM AN EVIL DREAM TO FIND THE FAMILIAR NIGHT STILL OVER THE WORLD BUT GOLLUM LAY ON THE GROUND AS IF HE HAD BEEN STUNNED THEY ROUSED HIM WITH DIFFICULTY AND FOR SOME TIME HE WOULD NOT LIFT HIS FACE BUT KNELT FORWARD ON HIS ELBOWS COVERING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WITH HIS LARGE FLAT HANDS
WRAITHS HE WAILED WRAITHS ON WINGS THE PRECIOUS IS THEIR MASTER THEY SEE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING NOTHING CAN HIDE FROM THEM CURSE THE WHITE FACE AND THEY TELL HIM EVERYTHING HE SEES HE KNOWS ACH GOLLUM GOLLUM GOLLUM IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MOON HAD SUNK WESTERING FAR BEYOND TOL BRANDIR THAT HE WOULD GET UP OR MAKE A MOVE
FROM THAT TIME ON SAM THOUGHT THAT HE SENSED A CHANGE IN GOLLUM AGAIN HE WAS MORE FAWNING AND WOULDBE FRIENDLY BUT SAM SURPRISED SOME STRANGE LOOKS IN HIS EYES AT TIMES ESPECIALLY TOWARDS FRODO AND HE WENT BACK MORE AND MORE INTO HIS OLD MANNER OF SPEAKING AND SAM HAD ANOTHER GROWING ANXIETY FRODO SEEMED TO BE WEARY WEARY TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION HE SAID NOTHING INDEED HE HARDLY SPOKE AT ALL AND HE DID NOT COMPLAIN BUT HE WALKED LIKE ONE WHO CARRIES A LOAD THE WEIGHT OF WHICH IS EVER INCREASING AND HE DRAGGED ALONG SLOWER AND SLOWER SO THAT SAM HAD OFTEN TO BEG GOLLUM TO WAIT AND NOT TO LEAVE THEIR MASTER BEHIND
IN FACT WITH EVERY STEP TOWARDS THE GATES OF MORDOR FRODO FELT THE RING ON ITS CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK GROW MORE BURDENSOME HE WAS NOW BEGINNING TO FEEL IT AS AN ACTUAL WEIGHT DRAGGING HIM EARTHWARDS BUT FAR MORE HE WAS TROUBLED BY THE EYE SO HE CALLED IT TO HIMSELF IT WAS THAT MORE THAN THE DRAG OF THE RING THAT MADE HIM COWER AND STOOP AS HE WALKED THE EYE THAT HORRIBLE GROWING SENSE OF A HOSTILE WILL THAT STROVE WITH GREAT POWER TO PIERCE ALL SHADOWS OF CLOUD AND EARTH AND FLESH AND TO SEE YOU TO PIN YOU UNDER ITS DEADLY GAZE NAKED IMMOVABLE SO THIN SO FRAIL AND THIN THE VEILS WERE BECOME THAT STILL WARDED IT OFF FRODO KNEW JUST WHERE THE PRESENT HABITATION AND HEART OF THAT WILL NOW WAS AS CERTAINLY AS A MAN CAN TELL THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN WITH HIS EYES SHUT HE WAS FACING IT AND ITS POTENCY BEAT UPON HIS BROW
GOLLUM PROBABLY FELT SOMETHING OF THE SAME SORT BUT WHAT WENT ON IN HIS WRETCHED HEART BETWEEN THE PRESSURE OF THE EYE AND THE LUST OF THE RING THAT WAS SO NEAR AND HIS GROVELLING PROMISE MADE HALF IN THE FEAR OF COLD IRON THE HOBBITS DID NOT GUESS FRODO GAVE NO THOUGHT TO IT SAMS MIND WAS OCCUPIED MOSTLY WITH HIS MASTER HARDLY NOTICING THE DARK CLOUD THAT HAD FALLEN ON HIS OWN HEART HE PUT FRODO IN FRONT OF HIM NOW AND KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE ON EVERY MOVEMENT OF HIS SUPPORTING HIM IF HE STUMBLED AND TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIM WITH CLUMSY WORDS
WHEN DAY CAME AT LAST THE HOBBITS WERE SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MUCH CLOSER THE OMINOUS MOUNTAINS HAD ALREADY DRAWN THE AIR WAS NOW CLEARER AND COLDER AND THOUGH STILL FAR OFF THE WALLS OF MORDOR WERE NO LONGER A CLOUDY MENACE ON THE EDGE OF SIGHT BUT AS GRIM BLACK TOWERS THEY FROWNED ACROSS A DISMAL WASTE THE MARSHES WERE AT AN END DYING AWAY INTO DEAD PEATS AND WIDE FLATS OF DRY CRACKED MUD THE LAND AHEAD ROSE IN LONG SHALLOW SLOPES BARREN AND PITILESS TOWARDS THE DESERT THAT LAY AT SAURONS GATE
WHILE THE GREY LIGHT LASTED THEY COWERED UNDER A BLACK STONE LIKE WORMS SHRINKING LEST THE WINGED TERROR SHOULD PASS AND SPY THEM WITH ITS CRUEL EYES THE REMAINDER OF THAT JOURNEY WAS A SHADOW OF GROWING FEAR IN WHICH MEMORY COULD FIND NOTHING TO REST UPON FOR TWO MORE NIGHTS THEY STRUGGLED ON THROUGH THE WEARY PATHLESS LAND THE AIR AS IT SEEMED TO THEM GREW HARSH AND FILLED WITH A BITTER REEK THAT CAUGHT THEIR BREATH AND PARCHED THEIR MOUTHS
AT LAST ON THE FIFTH MORNING SINCE THEY TOOK THE ROAD WITH GOLLUM THEY HALTED ONCE MORE BEFORE THEM DARK IN THE DAWN THE GREAT MOUNTAINS REACHED UP TO ROOFS OF SMOKE AND CLOUD OUT FROM THEIR FEET WERE FLUNG HUGE BUTTRESSES AND BROKEN HILLS THAT WERE NOW AT THE NEAREST SCARCE A DOZEN MILES AWAY FRODO LOOKED ROUND IN HORROR DREADFUL AS THE DEAD MARSHES HAD BEEN AND THE ARID MOORS OF THE NOMANLANDS MORE LOATHSOME FAR WAS THE COUNTRY THAT THE CRAWLING DAY NOW SLOWLY UNVEILED TO HIS SHRINKING EYES EVEN TO THE MERE OF DEAD FACES SOME HAGGARD PHANTOM OF GREEN SPRING WOULD COME BUT HERE NEITHER SPRING NOR SUMMER WOULD EVER COME AGAIN HERE NOTHING LIVED NOT EVEN THE LEPROUS GROWTHS THAT FEED ON ROTTENNESS THE GASPING POOLS WERE CHOKED WITH ASH AND CRAWLING MUDS SICKLY WHITE AND GREY AS IF THE MOUNTAINS HAD VOMITED THE FILTH OF THEIR ENTRAILS UPON THE LANDS ABOUT HIGH MOUNDS OF CRUSHED AND POWDERED ROCK GREAT CONES OF EARTH FIREBLASTED AND POISONSTAINED STOOD LIKE AN OBSCENE GRAVEYARD IN ENDLESS ROWS SLOWLY REVEALED IN THE RELUCTANT LIGHT
THEY HAD COME TO THE DESOLATION THAT LAY BEFORE MORDOR THE LASTING MONUMENT TO THE DARK LABOUR OF ITS SLAVES THAT SHOULD ENDURE WHEN ALL THEIR PURPOSES WERE MADE VOID A LAND DEFILED DISEASED BEYOND ALL HEALING  UNLESS THE GREAT SEA SHOULD ENTER IN AND WASH IT WITH OBLIVION I FEEL SICK SAID SAM FRODO DID NOT SPEAK
FOR A WHILE THEY STOOD THERE LIKE MEN ON THE EDGE OF A SLEEP WHERE NIGHTMARE LURKS HOLDING IT OFF THOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN ONLY COME TO MORNING THROUGH THE SHADOWS THE LIGHT BROADENED AND HARDENED THE GASPING PITS AND POISONOUS MOUNDS GREW HIDEOUSLY CLEAR THE SUN WAS UP WALKING AMONG CLOUDS AND LONG FLAGS OF SMOKE BUT EVEN THE SUNLIGHT WAS DEFILED THE HOBBITS HAD NO WELCOME FOR THAT LIGHT UNFRIENDLY IT SEEMED REVEALING THEM IN THEIR HELPLESSNESS  LITTLE SQUEAKING GHOSTS THAT WANDERED AMONG THE ASHHEAPS OF THE DARK LORD
TOO WEARY TO GO FURTHER THEY SOUGHT FOR SOME PLACE WHERE THEY COULD REST FOR A WHILE THEY SAT WITHOUT SPEAKING UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MOUND OF SLAG BUT FOUL FUMES LEAKED OUT OF IT CATCHING THEIR THROATS AND CHOKING THEM GOLLUM WAS THE FIRST TO GET UP SPLUTTERING AND CURSING HE ROSE AND WITHOUT A WORD OR A GLANCE AT THE HOBBITS HE CRAWLED AWAY ON ALL FOURS FRODO AND SAM CRAWLED AFTER HIM UNTIL THEY CAME TO A WIDE ALMOST CIRCULAR PIT HIGHBANKED UPON THE WEST IT WAS COLD AND DEAD AND A FOUL SUMP OF OILY MANYCOLOURED OOZE LAY AT ITS BOTTOM IN THIS EVIL HOLE THEY COWERED HOPING IN ITS SHADOW TO ESCAPE THE ATTENTION OF THE EYE
THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY A GREAT THIRST TROUBLED THEM BUT THEY DRANK ONLY A FEW DROPS FROM THEIR BOTTLES  LAST FILLED IN THE GULLY WHICH NOW AS THEY LOOKED BACK IN THOUGHT SEEMED TO THEM A PLACE OF PEACE AND BEAUTY THE HOBBITS TOOK IT IN TURN TO WATCH AT FIRST TIRED AS THEY WERE NEITHER OF THEM COULD SLEEP AT ALL BUT AS THE SUN FAR AWAY WAS CLIMBING DOWN INTO SLOW MOVING CLOUD SAM DOZED IT WAS FRODOS TURN TO BE ON GUARD HE LAY BACK ON THE SLOPE OF THE PIT BUT THAT DID NOT EASE THE SENSE OF BURDEN THAT WAS ON HIM HE LOOKED UP AT THE SMOKESTREAKED SKY AND SAW STRANGE PHANTOMS DARK RIDING SHAPES AND FACES OUT OF THE PAST HE LOST COUNT OF TIME HOVERING BETWEEN SLEEP AND WAKING UNTIL FORGETFULNESS CAME OVER HIM
SUDDENLY SAM WOKE UP THINKING THAT HE HEARD HIS MASTER CALLING IT WAS EVENING FRODO COULD NOT HAVE CALLED FOR HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND HAD SLID DOWN NEARLY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT GOLLUM WAS BY HIM FOR A MOMENT SAM THOUGHT THAT HE WAS TRYING TO ROUSE FRODO THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NOT SO GOLLUM WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF SMEAGOL WAS HOLDING A DEBATE WITH SOME OTHER THOUGHT THAT USED THE SAME VOICE BUT MADE IT SQUEAK AND HISS A PALE LIGHT AND A GREEN LIGHT ALTERNATED IN HIS EYES AS HE SPOKE
SMEAGOL PROMISED SAID THE FIRST THOUGHT
YES YES MY PRECIOUS CAME THE ANSWER WE PROMISED TO SAVE OUR PRECIOUS NOT TO LET HIM HAVE IT  NEVER BUT ITS GOING TO HIM YES NEARER EVERY STEP WHATS THE HOBBIT GOING TO DO WITH IT WE WONDERS YES WE WONDERS
I DONT KNOW I CANT HELP IT MASTERS GOT IT SMEAGOL PROMISED TO HELP THE MASTER
YES YES TO HELP THE MASTER THE MASTER OF THE PRECIOUS BUT IF WE WAS MASTER THEN WE COULD HELP OURSELFS YES AND STILL KEEP PROMISES

BUT THERES TWO OF THEM THEYLL WAKE TOO QUICK AND KILL US WHINED SMEAGOL IN A LAST EFFORT NOT NOW NOT YET
WE WANTS IT BUT  AND HERE THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE AS IF A NEW THOUGHT HAD WAKENED NOT YET EH PERHAPS NOT SHE MIGHT HELP SHE MIGHT YES
NO NO NOT THAT WAY WAILED SMEAGOL
YES WE WANTS IT WE WANTS IT
EACH TIME THAT THE SECOND THOUGHT SPOKE GOLLUMS LONG HAND CREPT OUT SLOWLY PAWING TOWARDS FRODO AND THEN WAS DRAWN BACK WITH A JERK AS SMEAGOL SPOKE AGAIN FINALLY BOTH ARMS WITH LONG FINGERS FLEXED AND TWITCHING CLAWED TOWARDS HIS NECK
SAM HAD LAIN STILL FASCINATED BY THIS DEBATE BUT WATCHING EVERY MOVE THAT GOLLUM MADE FROM UNDER HIS HALFCLOSED EYELIDS TO HIS SIMPLE MIND ORDINARY HUNGER THE DESIRE TO EAT HOBBITS HAD SEEMED THE CHIEF DANGER IN GOLLUM HE REALIZED NOW THAT IT WAS NOT SO GOLLUM WAS FEELING THE TERRIBLE CALL OF THE RING THE DARK LORD WAS HE OF COURSE BUT SAM WONDERED WHO SHE WAS ONE OF THE NASTY FRIENDS THE LITTLE WRETCH HAD MADE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE SUPPOSED THEN HE FORGOT THE POINT FOR THINGS HAD PLAINLY GONE FAR ENOUGH AND WERE GETTING DANGEROUS A GREAT HEAVINESS WAS IN ALL HIS LIMBS BUT HE ROUSED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT AND SAT UP SOMETHING WARNED HIM TO BE CAREFUL AND NOT TO REVEAL THAT HE HAD OVERHEARD THE DEBATE HE LET OUT A LOUD SIGH AND GAVE A HUGE YAWN
WHATS THE TIME HE SAID SLEEPILY
GOLLUM SENT OUT A LONG HISS THROUGH HIS TEETH HE STOOD UP FOR A MOMENT TENSE AND MENACING AND THEN HE COLLAPSED FALLING FORWARD ON TO ALL FOURS AND CRAWLING UP THE BANK OF THE PIT NICE HOBBITS NICE SAM HE SAID SLEEPY HEADS YES SLEEPY HEADS LEAVE GOOD SMEAGOL TO WATCH BUT ITS EVENING DUSK IS CREEPING TIME TO GO
HIGH TIME THOUGHT SAM AND TIME WE PARTED TOO YET IT CROSSED HIS MIND TO WONDER IF INDEED GOLLUM WAS NOT NOW AS DANGEROUS TURNED LOOSE AS KEPT WITH THEM CURSE HIM I WISH HE WAS CHOKED HE MUTTERED HE STUMBLED DOWN THE BANK AND ROUSED HIS MASTER
STRANGELY ENOUGH FRODO FELT REFRESHED HE HAD BEEN DREAMING THE DARK SHADOW HAD PASSED AND A FAIR VISION HAD VISITED HIM IN THIS LAND OF DISEASE NOTHING REMAINED OF IT IN HIS MEMORY YET BECAUSE OF IT HE FELT GLAD AND LIGHTER OF HEART HIS BURDEN WAS LESS HEAVY ON HIM GOLLUM WELCOMED HIM WITH DOGLIKE DELIGHT HE CHUCKLED AND CHATTERED CRACKING HIS LONG FINGERS AND PAWING AT FRODOS KNEES FRODO SMILED AT HIM
COME HE SAID YOU HAVE GUIDED US WELL AND FAITHFULLY THIS IS THE LAST STAGE BRING US TO THE GATE AND THEN I WILL NOT ASK YOU TO GO FURTHER BRING US TO THE GATE AND YOU MAY GO WHERE YOU WISH  ONLY NOT TO OUR ENEMIES
TO THE GATE EH GOLLUM SQUEAKED SEEMING SURPRISED AND FRIGHTENED TO THE GATE MASTER SAYS YES HE SAYS SO AND GOOD SMEAGOL DOES WHAT HE ASKS O YES BUT WHEN WE GETS CLOSER WELL SEE PERHAPS WELL SEE THEN IT WONT LOOK NICE AT ALL O NO O NO
GO ON WITH YOU SAID SAM LETS GET IT OVER
IN THE FALLING DUSK THEY SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT AND SLOWLY THREADED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DEAD LAND THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THEY FELT ONCE MORE THE FEAR THAT HAD FALLEN ON THEM WHEN THE WINGED SHAPE SWEPT OVER THE MARSHES THEY HALTED COWERING ON THE EVILSMELLING GROUND BUT THEY SAW NOTHING IN THE GLOOMY EVENING SKY ABOVE AND SOON THE MENACE PASSED HIGH OVERHEAD GOING MAYBE ON SOME SWIFT ERRAND FROM BARADDUR AFTER A WHILE GOLLUM GOT UP AND CREPT FORWARD AGAIN MUTTERING AND SHAKING
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER MIDNIGHT THE FEAR FELL ON THEM A THIRD TIME BUT IT NOW SEEMED MORE REMOTE AS IF IT WERE PASSING FAR ABOVE THE CLOUDS RUSHING WITH TERRIBLE SPEED INTO THE WEST GOLLUM HOWEVER WAS HELPLESS WITH TERROR AND WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE BEING HUNTED THAT THEIR APPROACH WAS KNOWN
THREE TIMES HE WHIMPERED THREE TIMES IS A THREAT THEY FEEL US HERE THEY FEEL THE PRECIOUS THE PRECIOUS IS THEIR MASTER WE CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER THIS WAY NO ITS NO USE NO USE
PLEADING AND KIND WORDS WERE NO LONGER OF ANY AVAIL IT WAS NOT UNTIL FRODO COMMANDED HIM ANGRILY AND LAID A HAND ON HIS SWORDHILT THAT GOLLUM WOULD GET UP AGAIN THEN AT LAST HE ROSE WITH A SNARL AND WENT BEFORE THEM LIKE A BEATEN DOG
SO THEY STUMBLED ON THROUGH THE WEARY END OF THE NIGHT AND UNTIL THE COMING OF ANOTHER DAY OF FEAR THEY WALKED IN SILENCE WITH BOWED HEADS SEEING NOTHING AND HEARING NOTHING BUT THE WIND HISSING IN THEIR EARS



CHAPTER 3
THE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED

BEFORE THE NEXT DAY DAWNED THEIR JOURNEY TO MORDOR WAS OVER THE MARSHES AND THE DESERT WERE BEHIND THEM BEFORE THEM DARKLING AGAINST A PALLID SKY THE GREAT MOUNTAINS REARED THEIR THREATENING HEADS
UPON THE WEST OF MORDOR MARCHED THE GLOOMY RANGE OF EPHEL DUATH THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW AND UPON THE NORTH THE BROKEN PEAKS AND BARREN RIDGES OF ERED LITHUI GREY AS ASH BUT AS THESE RANGES APPROACHED ONE ANOTHER BEING INDEED BUT PARTS OF ONE GREAT WALL ABOUT THE MOURNFUL PLAINS OF LITHLAD AND OF GORGOROTH AND THE BITTER INLAND SEA OF NURNEN AMIDMOST THEY SWUNG OUT LONG ARMS NORTHWARD AND BETWEEN THESE ARMS THERE WAS A DEEP DEFILE THIS WAS CIRITH GORGOR THE HAUNTED PASS THE ENTRANCE TO THE LAND OF THE ENEMY HIGH CLIFFS LOWERED UPON EITHER SIDE AND THRUST FORWARD FROM ITS MOUTH WERE TWO SHEER HILLS BLACKBONED AND BARE UPON THEM STOOD THE TEETH OF MORDOR TWO TOWERS STRONG AND TALL IN DAYS LONG PAST THEY WERE BUILT BY THE MEN OF GONDOR IN THEIR PRIDE AND POWER AFTER THE OVERTHROW OF SAURON AND HIS FLIGHT LEST HE SHOULD SEEK TO RETURN TO HIS OLD REALM BUT THE STRENGTH OF GONDOR FAILED AND MEN SLEPT AND FOR LONG YEARS THE TOWERS STOOD EMPTY THEN SAURON RETURNED NOW THE WATCHTOWERS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DECAY WERE REPAIRED AND FILLED WITH ARMS AND GARRISONED WITH CEASELESS VIGILANCE STONYFACED THEY WERE WITH DARK WINDOWHOLES STARING NORTH AND EAST AND WEST AND EACH WINDOW WAS FULL OF SLEEPLESS EYES
ACROSS THE MOUTH OF THE PASS FROM CLIFF TO CLIFF THE DARK LORD HAD BUILT A RAMPART OF STONE IN IT THERE WAS A SINGLE GATE OF IRON AND UPON ITS BATTLEMENT SENTINELS PACED UNCEASINGLY BENEATH THE HILLS ON EITHER SIDE THE ROCK WAS BORED INTO A HUNDRED CAVES AND MAGGOTHOLES THERE A HOST OF ORCS LURKED READY AT A SIGNAL TO ISSUE FORTH LIKE BLACK ANTS GOING TO WAR NONE COULD PASS THE TEETH OF MORDOR AND NOT FEEL THEIR BITE UNLESS THEY WERE SUMMONED BY SAURON OR KNEW THE SECRET PASSWORDS THAT WOULD OPEN THE MORANNON THE BLACK GATE OF HIS LAND
THE TWO HOBBITS GAZED AT THE TOWERS AND THE WALL IN DESPAIR EVEN FROM A DISTANCE THEY COULD SEE IN THE DIM LIGHT THE MOVEMENT OF THE BLACK GUARDS UPON THE WALL AND THE PATROLS BEFORE THE GATE THEY LAY NOW PEERING OVER THE EDGE OF A ROCKY HOLLOW BENEATH THE OUTSTRETCHED SHADOW OF THE NORTHMOST BUTTRESS OF EPHEL DUATH WINGING THE HEAVY AIR IN A STRAIGHT FLIGHT A CROW MAYBE WOULD HAVE FLOWN BUT A FURLONG FROM THEIR HIDINGPLACE TO THE BLACK SUMMIT OF THE NEARER TOWER A FAINT SMOKE CURLED ABOVE IT AS IF FIRE SMOULDERED IN THE HILL BENEATH
DAY CAME AND THE FALLOW SUN BLINKED OVER THE LIFELESS RIDGES OF ERED LITHUI THEN SUDDENLY THE CRY OF BRAZENTHROATED TRUMPETS WAS HEARD FROM THE WATCHTOWERS THEY BLARED AND FAR AWAY FROM HIDDEN HOLDS AND OUTPOSTS IN THE HILLS CAME ANSWERING CALLS AND FURTHER STILL REMOTE BUT DEEP AND OMINOUS THERE ECHOED IN THE HOLLOW LAND BEYOND THE MIGHTY HORNS AND DRUMS OF BARADDUR ANOTHER DREADFUL DAY OF FEAR AND TOIL HAD COME TO MORDOR AND THE NIGHTGUARDS WERE SUMMONED TO THEIR DUNGEONS AND DEEP HALLS AND THE DAYGUARDS EVILEYED AND FELL WERE MARCHING TO THEIR POSTS STEEL GLEAMED DIMLY ON THE BATTLEMENT

I AM COMMANDED TO GO TO THE LAND OF MORDOR AND THEREFORE I SHALL GO SAID FRODO IF THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY THEN I MUST TAKE IT WHAT COMES AFTER MUST COME
SAM SAID NOTHING THE LOOK ON FRODOS FACE WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM HE KNEW THAT WORDS OF HIS WERE USELESS AND AFTER ALL HE NEVER HAD ANY REAL HOPE IN THE AFFAIR FROM THE BEGINNING BUT BEING A CHEERFUL HOBBIT HE HAD NOT NEEDED HOPE AS LONG AS DESPAIR COULD BE POSTPONED NOW THEY WERE COME TO THE BITTER END BUT HE HAD STUCK TO HIS MASTER ALL THE WAY THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD CHIEFLY COME FOR AND HE WOULD STILL STICK TO HIM HIS MASTER WOULD NOT GO TO MORDOR ALONE SAM WOULD GO WITH HIM  AND AT ANY RATE THEY WOULD GET RID OF GOLLUM
GOLLUM HOWEVER DID NOT INTEND TO BE GOT RID OF YET HE KNELT AT FRODOS FEET WRINGING HIS HANDS AND SQUEAKING NOT THIS WAY MASTER HE PLEADED THERE IS ANOTHER WAY O YES INDEED THERE IS ANOTHER WAY DARKER MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND MORE SECRET BUT SMEAGOL KNOWS IT LET SMEAGOL SHOW YOU
ANOTHER WAY SAID FRODO DOUBTFULLY LOOKING DOWN AT GOLLUM WITH SEARCHING EYES
YESS YESS INDEED THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY SMEAGOL FOUND IT LETS GO AND SEE IF ITS STILL THERE

NO MASTER DID NOT ASK MASTER DID NOT SAY WHAT HE MEANT TO DO HE DOES NOT TELL POOR SMEAGOL HE SAYS SMEAGOL TAKE ME TO THE GATE  AND THEN GOOD BYE SMEAGOL CAN RUN AWAY AND BE GOOD BUT NOW HE SAYS I PURPOSE TO ENTER MORDOR THIS WAY SO SMEAGOL IS VERY AFRAID HE DOES NOT WANT TO LOSE NICE MASTER AND HE PROMISED MASTER MADE HIM PROMISE TO SAVE THE PRECIOUS BUT MASTER IS GOING TO TAKE IT TO HIM STRAIGHT TO THE BLACK HAND IF MASTER WILL GO THIS WAY SO SMEAGOL MUST SAVE THEM BOTH AND HE THINKS OF ANOTHER WAY THAT THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME NICE MASTER SMEAGOL VERY GOOD ALWAYS HELPS
SAM FROWNED IF HE COULD HAVE BORED HOLES IN GOLLUM WITH HIS EYES HE WOULD HAVE DONE HIS MIND WAS FULL OF DOUBT TO ALL APPEARANCES GOLLUM WAS GENUINELY DISTRESSED AND ANXIOUS TO HELP FRODO BUT SAM REMEMBERING THE OVERHEARD DEBATE FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE LONG SUBMERGED SMEAGOL HAD COME OUT ON TOP THAT VOICE AT ANY RATE HAD NOT HAD THE LAST WORD IN THE DEBATE SAMS GUESS WAS THAT THE SMEAGOL AND GOLLUM HALVES OR WHAT IN HIS OWN MIND HE CALLED SLINKER AND STINKER HAD MADE A TRUCE AND A TEMPORARY ALLIANCE NEITHER WANTED THE ENEMY TO GET THE RING BOTH WISHED TO KEEP FRODO FROM CAPTURE AND UNDER THEIR EYE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE  AT ANY RATE AS LONG AS STINKER STILL HAD A CHANCE OF LAYING HANDS ON HIS PRECIOUS WHETHER THERE REALLY WAS ANOTHER WAY INTO MORDOR SAM DOUBTED
AND ITS A GOOD THING NEITHER HALF OF THE OLD VILLAIN DONT KNOW WHAT MASTER MEANS TO DO HE THOUGHT IF HE KNEW THAT MR FRODO IS TRYING TO PUT AN END TO HIS PRECIOUS FOR GOOD AND ALL THERED BE TROUBLE PRETTY QUICK I BET ANYHOW OLD STINKER IS SO FRIGHTENED OF THE ENEMY  AND HES UNDER ORDERS OF SOME KIND FROM HIM OR WAS  THAT HED GIVE US AWAY RATHER THAN BE CAUGHT HELPING US AND RATHER THAN LET HIS PRECIOUS BE MELTED MAYBE AT LEAST THATS MY IDEA AND I HOPE THE MASTER WILL THINK IT OUT CAREFULLY HES AS WISE AS ANY BUT HES SOFTHEARTED THATS WHAT HE IS ITS BEYOND ANY GAMGEE TO GUESS WHAT HELL DO NEXT
FRODO DID NOT ANSWER GOLLUM AT ONCE WHILE THESE DOUBTS WERE PASSING THROUGH SAMS SLOW BUT SHREWD MIND HE STOOD GAZING OUT TOWARDS THE DARK CLIFF OF CIRITH GORGOR THE HOLLOW IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN REFUGE WAS DELVED IN THE SIDE OF A LOW HILL AT SOME LITTLE HEIGHT ABOVE A LONG TRENCHLIKE VALLEY THAT LAY BETWEEN IT AND THE OUTER BUTTRESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS IN THE MIDST OF THE VALLEY STOOD THE BLACK FOUNDATIONS OF THE WESTERN WATCHTOWER BY MORNINGLIGHT THE ROADS THAT CONVERGED UPON THE GATE OF MORDOR COULD NOW BE CLEARLY SEEN PALE AND DUSTY ONE WINDING BACK NORTHWARDS ANOTHER DWINDLING EASTWARDS INTO THE MISTS THAT CLUNG ABOUT THE FEET OF ERED LITHUI AND A THIRD THAT RAN TOWARDS HIM AS IT BENT SHARPLY ROUND THE TOWER IT ENTERED A NARROW DEFILE AND PASSED NOT FAR BELOW THE HOLLOW WHERE HE STOOD WESTWARD TO HIS RIGHT IT TURNED SKIRTING THE SHOULDERS OF THE MOUNTAINS AND WENT OFF SOUTHWARDS INTO THE DEEP SHADOWS THAT MANTLED ALL THE WESTERN SIDES OF EPHEL DUATH BEYOND HIS SIGHT IT JOURNEYED ON INTO THE NARROW LAND BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE GREAT RIVER
AS HE GAZED FRODO BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WAS A GREAT STIR AND MOVEMENT ON THE PLAIN IT SEEMED AS IF WHOLE ARMIES WERE ON THE MARCH THOUGH FOR THE MOST PART THEY WERE HIDDEN BY THE REEKS AND FUMES DRIFTING FROM THE FENS AND WASTES BEYOND BUT HERE AND THERE HE CAUGHT THE GLEAM OF SPEARS AND HELMETS AND OVER THE LEVELS BESIDE THE ROADS HORSEMEN COULD BE SEEN RIDING IN MANY COMPANIES HE REMEMBERED HIS VISION FROM AFAR UPON AMON HEN SO FEW DAYS BEFORE THOUGH NOW IT SEEMED MANY YEARS AGO THEN HE KNEW THAT THE HOPE THAT HAD FOR ONE WILD MOMENT STIRRED IN HIS HEART WAS VAIN THE TRUMPETS HAD NOT RUNG IN CHALLENGE BUT IN GREETING THIS WAS NO ASSAULT UPON THE DARK LORD BY THE MEN OF GONDOR RISEN LIKE AVENGING GHOSTS FROM THE GRAVES OF VALOUR LONG PASSED AWAY THESE WERE MEN OF OTHER RACE OUT OF THE WIDE EASTLANDS GATHERING TO THE SUMMONS OF THEIR OVERLORD ARMIES THAT HAD ENCAMPED BEFORE HIS GATE BY NIGHT AND NOW MARCHED IN TO SWELL HIS MOUNTING POWER AS IF SUDDENLY MADE FULLY AWARE OF THE PERIL OF THEIR POSITION ALONE IN THE GROWING LIGHT OF DAY SO NEAR TO THIS VAST MENACE FRODO QUICKLY DREW HIS FRAIL GREY HOOD CLOSE UPON HIS HEAD AND STEPPED DOWN INTO THE DELL THEN HE TURNED TO GOLLUM
SMEAGOL HE SAID I WILL TRUST YOU ONCE MORE LNDEED IT SEEMS THAT I MUST DO SO AND THAT IT IS MY FATE TO RECEIVE HELP FROM YOU WHERE I LEAST LOOKED FOR IT AND YOUR FATE TO HELP ME WHOM YOU LONG PURSUED WITH EVIL PURPOSE SO FAR YOU HAVE DESERVED WELL OF ME AND HAVE KEPT YOUR PROMISE TRULY TRULY I SAY AND MEAN HE ADDED WITH A GLANCE AT SAM FOR TWICE NOW WE HAVE BEEN IN YOUR POWER AND YOU HAVE DONE NO HARM TO US NOR HAVE YOU TRIED TO TAKE FROM ME WHAT YOU ONCE SOUGHT MAY THE THIRD TIME PROVE THE BEST BUT I WARN YOU SMEAGOL YOU ARE IN DANGER
YES YES MASTER SAID GOLLUM DREADFUL DANGER SMEAGOLS BONES SHAKE TO THINK OF IT BUT HE DOESNT RUN AWAY HE MUST HELP NICE MASTER
I DID NOT MEAN THE DANGER THAT WE ALL SHARE SAID FRODO I MEAN A DANGER TO YOURSELF ALONE YOU SWORE A PROMISE BY WHAT YOU CALL THE PRECIOUS REMEMBER THAT IT WILL HOLD YOU TO IT BUT IT WILL SEEK A WAY TO TWIST IT TO YOUR OWN UNDOING ALREADY YOU ARE BEING TWISTED YOU REVEALED YOURSELF TO ME JUST NOW FOOLISHLY GIVE IT BACK TO SMEAGOL YOU SAID DO NOT SAY THAT AGAIN DO NOT LET THAT THOUGHT GROW IN YOU YOU WILL NEVER GET IT BACK BUT THE DESIRE OF IT MAY BETRAY YOU TO A BITTER END YOU WILL NEVER GET IT BACK IN THE LAST NEED SMEAGOL I SHOULD PUT ON THE PRECIOUS AND THE PRECIOUS MASTERED YOU LONG AGO IF I WEARING IT WERE TO COMMAND YOU YOU WOULD OBEY EVEN IF IT WERE TO LEAP FROM A PRECIPICE OR TO CAST YOURSELF INTO THE FIRE AND SUCH WOULD BE MY COMMAND SO HAVE A CARE SMEAGOL
SAM LOOKED AT HIS MASTER WITH APPROVAL BUT ALSO WITH SURPRISE THERE WAS A LOOK IN HIS FACE AND A TONE IN HIS VOICE THAT HE HAD NOT KNOWN BEFORE IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN A NOTION OF HIS THAT THE KINDNESS OF DEAR MR FRODO WAS OF SUCH A HIGH DEGREE THAT IT MUST IMPLY A FAIR MEASURE OF BLINDNESS OF COURSE HE ALSO FIRMLY HELD THE INCOMPATIBLE BELIEF THAT MR FRODO WAS THE WISEST PERSON IN THE WORLD WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF OLD MR BILBO AND OF GANDALF GOLLUM IN HIS OWN WAY AND WITH MUCH MORE EXCUSE AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE WAS MUCH BRIEFER MAY HAVE MADE A SIMILAR MISTAKE CONFUSING KINDNESS AND BLINDNESS AT ANY RATE THIS SPEECH ABASHED AND TERRIFIED HIM HE GROVELLED ON THE GROUND AND COULD SPEAK NO CLEAR WORDS BUT NICE MASTER
FRODO WAITED PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE THEN HE SPOKE AGAIN LESS STERNLY COME NOW GOLLUM OR SMEAGOL IF YOU WISH TELL ME OF THIS OTHER WAY AND SHOW ME IF YOU CAN WHAT HOPE THERE IS IN IT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ME IN TURNING ASIDE FROM MY PLAIN PATH I AM IN HASTE
BUT GOLLUM WAS IN A PITIABLE STATE AND FRODOS THREAT HAD QUITE UNNERVED HIM IT WAS NOT EASY TO GET ANY CLEAR ACCOUNT OUT OF HIM AMID HIS MUMBLINGS AND SQUEAKINGS AND THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS IN WHICH HE CRAWLED ON THE FLOOR AND BEGGED THEM BOTH TO BE KIND TO POOR LITTLE SMEAGOL AFTER A WHILE HE GREW A LITTLE CALMER AND FRODO GATHERED BIT BY BIT THAT IF A TRAVELLER FOLLOWED THE ROAD THAT TURNED WEST OF EPHEL DUATH HE WOULD COME IN TIME TO A CROSSING IN A CIRCLE OF DARK TREES ON THE RIGHT A ROAD WENT DOWN TO OSGILIATH AND THE BRIDGES OF THE ANDUIN IN THE MIDDLE THE ROAD WENT ON SOUTHWARDS
ON ON ON SAID GOLLUM WE NEVER WENT THAT WAY BUT THEY SAY IT GOES A HUNDRED LEAGUES UNTIL YOU CAN SEE THE GREAT WATER THAT IS NEVER STILL THERE ARE LOTS OF FISHES THERE AND BIG BIRDS EAT FISHES NICE BIRDS BUT WE NEVER WENT THERE ALAS NO WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE AND FURTHER STILL THERE ARE MORE LANDS THEY SAY BUT THE YELLOW FACE IS VERY HOT THERE AND THERE ARE SELDOM ANY CLOUDS AND THE MEN ARE FIERCE AND HAVE DARK FACES WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THAT LAND
NO SAID FRODO BUT DO NOT WANDER FROM YOUR ROAD WHAT OF THE THIRD TURNING
O YES O YES THERE IS A THIRD WAY SAID GOLLUM THAT IS THE ROAD TO THE LEFT AT ONCE IT BEGINS TO CLIMB UP UP WINDING AND CLIMBING BACK TOWARDS THE TALL SHADOWS WHEN IT TURNS ROUND THE BLACK ROCK YOULL SEE IT SUDDENLY YOULL SEE IT ABOVE YOU AND YOULL WANT TO HIDE
SEE IT SEE IT WHAT WILL YOU SEE
THE OLD FORTRESS VERY OLD VERY HORRIBLE NOW WE USED TO HEAR TALES FROM THE SOUTH WHEN SMEAGOL WAS YOUNG LONG AGO O YES WE USED TO TELL LOTS OF TALES IN THE EVENING SITTING BY THE BANKS OF THE GREAT RIVER IN THE WILLOWLANDS WHEN THE RIVER WAS YOUNGER TOO GOLLUM GOLLUM HE BEGAN TO WEEP AND MUTTER THE HOBBITS WAITED PATIENTLY
TALES OUT OF THE SOUTH GOLLUM WENT ON AGAIN ABOUT THE TALL MEN WITH THE SHINING EYES AND THEIR HOUSES LIKE HILLS OF STONE AND THE SILVER CROWN OF THEIR KING AND HIS WHITE TREE WONDERFUL TALES THEY BUILT VERY TALL TOWERS AND ONE THEY RAISED WAS SILVERWHITE AND IN IT THERE WAS A STONE LIKE THE MOON AND ROUND IT WERE GREAT WHITE WALLS O YES THERE WERE MANY TALES ABOUT THE TOWER OF THE MOON
THAT WOULD BE MINAS ITHIL THAT ISILDUR THE SON OF ELENDIL BUILT SAID FRODO IT WAS ISILDUR WHO CUT OFF THE FINGER OF THE ENEMY
YES HE HAS ONLY FOUR ON THE BLACK HAND BUT THEY ARE ENOUGH SAID GOLLUM SHUDDERING AND HE HATED ISILDURS CITY
WHAT DOES HE NOT HATE SAID FRODO BUT WHAT HAS THE TOWER OF THE MOON TO DO WITH US
WELL MASTER THERE IT WAS AND THERE IT IS THE TALL TOWER AND THE WHITE HOUSES AND THE WALL BUT NOT NICE NOW NOT BEAUTIFUL HE CONQUERED IT LONG AGO IT IS A VERY TERRIBLE PLACE NOW TRAVELLERS SHIVER WHEN THEY SEE IT THEY CREEP OUT OF SIGHT THEY AVOID ITS SHADOW BUT MASTER WILL HAVE TO GO THAT WAY THAT IS THE ONLY OTHER WAY FOR THE MOUNTAINS ARE LOWER THERE AND THE OLD ROAD GOES UP AND UP UNTIL IT REACHES A DARK PASS AT THE TOP AND THEN IT GOES DOWN DOWN AGAIN  TO GORGOROTH HIS VOICE SANK TO A WHISPER AND HE SHUDDERED
BUT HOW WILL THAT HELP US ASKED SAM SURELY THE ENEMY KNOWS ALL ABOUT HIS OWN MOUNTAINS AND THAT ROAD WILL BE GUARDED AS CLOSE AS THIS THE TOWER ISNT EMPTY IS IT
O NO NOT EMPTY WHISPERED GOLLUM IT SEEMS EMPTY BUT IT ISNT O NO VERY DREADFUL THINGS LIVE THERE ORCS YES ALWAYS ORCS BUT WORSE THINGS WORSE THINGS LIVE THERE TOO THE ROAD CLIMBS RIGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE WALLS AND PASSES THE GATE NOTHING MOVES ON THE ROAD THAT THEY DONT KNOW ABOUT THE THINGS INSIDE KNOW THE SILENT WATCHERS
SO THATS YOUR ADVICE IS IT SAID SAM THAT WE SHOULD GO ANOTHER LONG MARCH SOUTH TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME FIX OR A WORSE ONE WHEN WE GET THERE IF WE EVER DO
NO NO INDEED SAID GOLLUM HOBBITS MUST SEE MUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND HE DOES NOT EXPECT ATTACK THAT WAY HIS EYE IS ALL ROUND BUT IT ATTENDS MORE TO SOME PLACES THAN TO OTHERS HE CANT SEE EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE NOT YET YOU SEE HE HAS CONQUERED ALL THE COUNTRY WEST OF THE SHADOWY MOUNTAINS DOWN TO THE RIVER AND HE HOLDS THE BRIDGES NOW HE THINKS NO ONE CAN COME TO THE MOONTOWER WITHOUT FIGHTING BIG BATTLE AT THE BRIDGES OR GETTING LOTS OF BOATS WHICH THEY CANNOT HIDE AND HE WILL KNOW ABOUT
YOU SEEM TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT WHAT HES DOING AND THINKING SAID SAM HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO HIM LATELY OR JUST HOBNOBBING WITH ORCS
NOT NICE HOBBIT NOT SENSIBLE SAID GOLLUM GIVING SAM AN ANGRY GLANCE AND TURNING TO FRODO SMEAGOL HAS TALKED TO ORCS YES OF COURSE BEFORE HE MET MASTER AND TO MANY PEOPLES HE HAS WALKED VERY FAR AND WHAT HE SAYS NOW MANY PEOPLES ARE SAYING ITS HERE IN THE NORTH THAT THE BIG DANGER IS FOR HIM AND FOR US HE WILL COME OUT OF THE BLACK GATE ONE DAY ONE DAY SOON THAT IS THE ONLY WAY BIG ARMIES CAN COME BUT AWAY DOWN WEST HE IS NOT AFRAID AND THERE ARE THE SILENT WATCHERS
JUST SO SAID SAM NOT TO BE PUT OFF AND SO WE ARE TO WALK UP AND KNOCK AT THEIR GATE AND ASK IF WERE ON THE RIGHT ROAD FOR MORDOR OR ARE THEY TOO SILENT TO ANSWER ITS NOT SENSE WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT HERE AND SAVE OURSELVES A LONG TRAMP
DONT MAKE JOKES ABOUT IT HISSED GOLLUM IT ISNT FUNNY O NO NOT AMUSING ITS NOT SENSE TO TRY AND GET INTO MORDOR AT ALL BUT IF MASTER SAYS I MUST GO OR I WILL GO THEN HE MUST TRY SOME WAY BUT HE MUST NOT GO TO THE TERRIBLE CITY O NO OF COURSE NOT THAT IS WHERE SMEAGOL HELPS NICE SMEAGOL THOUGH NO ONE TELLS HIM WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT SMEAGOL HELPS AGAIN HE FOUND IT HE KNOWS IT
WHAT DID YOU FIND ASKED FRODO
GOLLUM CROUCHED DOWN AND HIS VOICE SANK TO A WHISPER AGAIN A LITTLE PATH LEADING UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND THEN A STAIR A NARROW STAIR O YES VERY LONG AND NARROW AND THEN MORE STAIRS AND THEN  HIS VOICE SANK EVEN LOWER  A TUNNEL A DARK TUNNEL AND AT LAST A LITTLE CLEFT AND A PATH HIGH ABOVE THE MAIN PASS IT WAS THAT WAY THAT SMEAGOL GOT OUT OF THE DARKNESS BUT IT WAS YEARS AGO THE PATH MAY HAVE VANISHED NOW BUT PERHAPS NOT PERHAPS NOT
I DONT LIKE THE SOUND OF IT AT ALL SAID SAM SOUNDS TOO EASY AT ANY RATE IN THE TELLING IF THAT PATH IS STILL THERE ITLL BE GUARDED TOO WASNT IT GUARDED GOLLUM AS HE SAID THIS HE CAUGHT OR FANCIED HE CAUGHT A GREEN GLEAM IN GOLLUMS EYE GOLLUM MUTTERED BUT DID NOT REPLY
IS IT NOT GUARDED ASKED FRODO STERNLY AND DID YOU ESCAPE OUT OF THE DARKNESS SMEAGOL WERE YOU NOT RATHER PERMITTED TO DEPART UPON AN ERRAND THAT AT LEAST IS WHAT ARAGORN THOUGHT WHO FOUND YOU BY THE DEAD MARSHES SOME YEARS AGO
ITS A LIE HISSED GOLLUM AND AN EVIL LIGHT CAME INTO HIS EYES AT THE NAMING OF ARAGORN HE LIED ON ME YES HE DID I DID ESCAPE ALL BY MY POOR SELF INDEED I WAS TOLD TO SEEK FOR THE PRECIOUS AND I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED OF COURSE I HAVE BUT NOT FOR THE BLACK ONE THE PRECIOUS WAS OURS IT WAS MINE I TELL YOU I DID ESCAPE
FRODO FELT A STRANGE CERTAINTY THAT IN THIS MATTER GOLLUM WAS FOR ONCE NOT SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH AS MIGHT BE SUSPECTED THAT HE HAD SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY OUT OF MORDOR AND AT LEAST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS BY HIS OWN CUNNING FOR ONE THING HE NOTED THAT GOLLUM USED I AND THAT SEEMED USUALLY TO BE A SIGN ON ITS RARE APPEARANCES THAT SOME REMNANTS OF OLD TRUTH AND SINCERITY WERE FOR THE MOMENT ON TOP BUT EVEN IF GOLLUM COULD BE TRUSTED ON THIS POINT FRODO DID NOT FORGET THE WILES OF THE ENEMY THE ESCAPE MAY HAVE BEEN ALLOWED OR ARRANGED AND WELL KNOWN IN THE DARK TOWER AND IN ANY CASE GOLLUM WAS PLAINLY KEEPING A GOOD DEAL BACK
I ASK YOU AGAIN HE SAID IS NOT THIS SECRET WAY GUARDED
BUT THE NAME OF ARAGORN HAD PUT GOLLUM INTO A SULLEN MOOD HE HAD ALL THE INJURED AIR OF A LIAR SUSPECTED WHEN FOR ONCE HE HAS TOLD THE TRUTH OR PART OF IT HE DID NOT ANSWER
IS IT NOT GUARDED FRODO REPEATED
YES YES PERHAPS NO SAFE PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY SAID GOLLUM SULKILY NO SAFE PLACES BUT MASTER MUST TRY IT OR GO HOME NO OTHER WAY THEY COULD NOT GET HIM TO SAY MORE THE NAME OF THE PERILOUS PLACE AND THE HIGH PASS HE COULD NOT TELL OR WOULD NOT
ITS NAME WAS CIRITH UNGOL A NAME OF DREADFUL RUMOUR ARAGORN COULD PERHAPS HAVE TOLD THEM THAT NAME AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE GANDALF WOULD HAVE WARNED THEM BUT THEY WERE ALONE AND ARAGORN WAS FAR AWAY AND GANDALF STOOD AMID THE RUIN OF ISENGARD AND STROVE WITH SARUMAN DELAYED BY TREASON YET EVEN AS HE SPOKE HIS LAST WORDS TO SARUMAN AND THE PALANTIR CRASHED IN FIRE UPON THE STEPS OF ORTHANC HIS THOUGHT WAS EVER UPON FRODO AND SAMWISE OVER THE LONG LEAGUES HIS MIND SOUGHT FOR THEM IN HOPE AND PITY
MAYBE FRODO FELT IT NOT KNOWING IT AS HE HAD UPON AMON HEN EVEN THOUGH HE BELIEVED THAT GANDALF WAS GONE GONE FOR EVER INTO THE SHADOW IN MORIA FAR AWAY HE SAT UPON THE GROUND FOR A LONG WHILE SILENT HIS HEAD BOWED STRIVING TO RECALL ALL THAT GANDALF HAD SAID TO HIM BUT FOR THIS CHOICE HE COULD RECALL NO COUNSEL INDEED GANDALFS GUIDANCE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM TOO SOON TOO SOON WHILE THE DARK LAND WAS STILL VERY FAR AWAY HOW THEY SHOULD ENTER IT AT THE LAST GANDALF HAD NOT SAID PERHAPS HE COULD NOT SAY INTO THE STRONGHOLD OF THE ENEMY IN THE NORTH INTO DOL GULDUR HE HAD ONCE VENTURED BUT INTO MORDOR TO THE MOUNTAIN OF FIRE AND TO BARADDUR SINCE THE DARK LORD ROSE IN POWER AGAIN HAD HE EVER JOURNEYED THERE FRODO DID NOT THINK SO AND HERE HE WAS A LITTLE HALFLING FROM THE SHIRE A SIMPLE HOBBIT OF THE QUIET COUNTRYSIDE EXPECTED TO FIND A WAY WHERE THE GREAT ONES COULD NOT GO OR DARED NOT GO IT WAS AN EVIL FATE BUT HE HAD TAKEN IT ON HIMSELF IN HIS OWN SITTINGROOM IN THE FAROFF SPRING OF ANOTHER YEAR SO REMOTE NOW THAT IT WAS LIKE A CHAPTER IN A STORY OF THE WORLDS YOUTH WHEN THE TREES OF SILVER AND GOLD WERE STILL IN BLOOM THIS WAS AN EVIL CHOICE WHICH WAY SHOULD HE CHOOSE AND IF BOTH LED TO TERROR AND DEATH WHAT GOOD LAY IN CHOICE
THE DAY DREW ON A DEEP SILENCE FELL UPON THE LITTLE GREY HOLLOW WHERE THEY LAY SO NEAR TO THE BORDERS OF THE LAND OF FEAR A SILENCE THAT COULD BE FELT AS IF IT WERE A THICK VEIL THAT CUT THEM OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD ABOUT THEM ABOVE THEM WAS A DOME OF PALE SKY BARRED WITH FLEETING SMOKE BUT IT SEEMED HIGH AND FAR AWAY AS IF SEEN THROUGH GREAT DEEPS OF AIR HEAVY WITH BROODING THOUGHT
NOT EVEN AN EAGLE POISED AGAINST THE SUN WOULD HAVE MARKED THE HOBBITS SITTING THERE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF DOOM SILENTNOT MOVING SHROUDED IN THEIR THIN GREY CLOAKS FOR A MOMENT HE MIGHT HAVE PAUSED TO CONSIDER GOLLUM A TINY FIGURE SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND THERE PERHAPS LAY THE FAMISHED SKELETON OF SOME CHILD OF MEN ITS RAGGED GARMENT STILL CLINGING TO IT ITS LONG ARMS AND LEGS ALMOST BONEWHITE AND BONETHIN NO FLESH WORTH A PECK
FRODOS HEAD WAS BOWED OVER HIS KNEES BUT SAM LEANED BACK WITH HANDS BEHIND HIS HEAD STARING OUT OF HIS HOOD AT THE EMPTY SKY AT LEAST FOR A LONG WHILE IT WAS EMPTY THEN PRESENTLY SAM THOUGHT HE SAW A DARK BIRDLIKE FIGURE WHEEL INTO THE CIRCLE OF HIS SIGHT AND HOVER AND THEN WHEEL AWAY AGAIN TWO MORE FOLLOWED AND THEN A FOURTH THEY WERE VERY SMALL TO LOOK AT YET HE KNEW SOMEHOW THAT THEY WERE HUGE WITH A VAST STRETCH OF PINION FLYING AT A GREAT HEIGHT HE COVERED HIS EYES AND BENT FORWARD COWERING THE SAME WARNING FEAR WAS ON HIM AS HE HAD FELT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BLACK RIDERS THE HELPLESS HORROR THAT HAD COME WITH THE CRY IN THE WIND AND THE SHADOW ON THE MOON THOUGH NOW IT WAS NOT SO CRUSHING OR COMPELLING THE MENACE WAS MORE REMOTE BUT MENACE IT WAS FRODO FELT IT TOO HIS THOUGHT WAS BROKEN HE STIRRED AND SHIVERED BUT HE DID NOT LOOK UP GOLLUM HUDDLED HIMSELF TOGETHER LIKE A CORNERED SPIDER THE WINGED SHAPES WHEELED AND STOOPED SWIFTLY DOWN SPEEDING BACK TO MORDOR
SAM TOOK A DEEP BREATH THE RIDERS ARE ABOUT AGAIN UP IN THE AIR HE SAID IN A HOARSE WHISPER I SAW THEM DO YOU THINK THEY COULD SEE US THEY WERE VERY HIGH UP AND IF THEY ARE BLACK RIDERS SAME AS BEFORE THEN THEY CANT SEE MUCH BY DAYLIGHT CAN THEY
NO PERHAPS NOT SAID FRODO BUT THEIR STEEDS COULD SEE AND THESE WINGED CREATURES THAT THEY RIDE ON NOW THEY CAN PROBABLY SEE MORE THAN ANY OTHER CREATURE THEY ARE LIKE GREAT CARRION BIRDS THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THE ENEMY IS ON THE WATCH I FEAR
THE FEELING OF DREAD PASSED BUT THE ENFOLDING SILENCE WAS BROKEN FOR SOME TIME THEY HAD BEEN CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD AS IF IN AN INVISIBLE ISLAND NOW THEY WERE LAID BARE AGAIN PERIL HAD RETURNED BUT STILL FRODO DID NOT SPEAK TO GOLLUM OR MAKE HIS CHOICE HIS EYES WERE CLOSED AS IF HE WERE DREAMING OR LOOKING INWARD INTO HIS HEART AND MEMORY AT LAST HE STIRRED AND STOOD UP AND IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK AND TO DECIDE BUT HARK HE SAID WHAT IS THAT
A NEW FEAR WAS UPON THEM THEY HEARD SINGING AND HOARSE SHOUTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED A LONG WAY OFF BUT IT DREW NEARER IT WAS COMING TOWARDS THEM IT LEAPED INTO ALL THEIR MINDS THAT THE BLACK WINGS HAD SPIED THEM AND HAD SENT ARMED SOLDIERS TO SEIZE THEM NO SPEED SEEMED TOO GREAT FOR THESE TERRIBLE SERVANTS OF SAURON THEY CROUCHED LISTENING THE VOICES AND THE CLINK OF WEAPONS AND HARNESS WERE VERY CLOSE FRODO AND SAM LOOSENED THEIR SMALL SWORDS IN THEIR SHEATHS FLIGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
GOLLUM ROSE SLOWLY AND CRAWLED INSECTLIKE TO THE LIP OF THE HOLLOW VERY CAUTIOUSLY HE RAISED HIMSELF INCH BY INCH UNTIL HE COULD PEER OVER IT BETWEEN TWO BROKEN POINTS OF STONE HE REMAINED THERE WITHOUT MOVING FOR SOME TIME MAKING NO SOUND PRESENTLY THE VOICES BEGAN TO RECEDE AGAIN AND THEN THEY SLOWLY FADED AWAY FAR OFF A HORN BLEW ON THE RAMPARTS OF THE MORANNON THEN QUIETLY GOLLUM DREW BACK AND SLIPPED DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW
MORE MEN GOING TO MORDOR HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE DARK FACES WE HAVE NOT SEEN MEN LIKE THESE BEFORE NO SMEAGOL HAS NOT THEY ARE FIERCE THEY HAVE BLACK EYES AND LONG BLACK HAIR AND GOLD RINGS IN THEIR EARS YES LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL GOLD AND SOME HAVE RED PAINT ON THEIR CHEEKS AND RED CLOAKS AND THEIR FLAGS ARE RED AND THE TIPS OF THEIR SPEARS AND THEY HAVE ROUND SHIELDS YELLOW AND BLACK WITH BIG SPIKES NOT NICE VERY CRUEL WICKED MEN THEY LOOK ALMOST AS BAD AS ORCS AND MUCH BIGGER SMEAGOL THINKS THEY HAVE COME OUT OF THE SOUTH BEYOND THE GREAT RIVERS END THEY CAME UP THAT ROAD THEY HAVE PASSED ON TO THE BLACK GATE BUT MORE MAY FOLLOW ALWAYS MORE PEOPLE COMING TO MORDOR ONE DAY ALL THE PEOPLES WILL BE INSIDE

CHAPTER 4
OF HERBS AND STEWED RABBIT

FOR THE FEW HOURS OF DAYLIGHT THAT WERE LEFT THEY RESTED SHIFTING INTO THE SHADE AS THE SUN MOVED UNTIL AT LAST THE SHADOW OF THE WESTERN RIM OF THEIR DELL GREW LONG AND DARKNESS FILLED ALL THE HOLLOW THEN THEY ATE A LITTLE AND DRANK SPARINGLY GOLLUM ATE NOTHING BUT HE ACCEPTED WATER GLADLY
SOON GET MORE NOW HE SAID LICKING HIS LIPS GOOD WATER RUNS DOWN IN STREAMS TO THE GREAT RIVER NICE WATER IN THE LANDS WE ARE GOING TO SMEAGOL WILL GET FOOD THERE TOO PERHAPS HES VERY HUNGRY YES GOLLUM HE SET HIS TWO LARGE FLAT HANDS ON HIS SHRUNKEN BELLY AND A PALE GREEN LIGHT CAME INTO HIS EYES
THE DUSK WAS DEEP WHEN AT LENGTH THEY SET OUT CREEPING OVER THE WESTWARD RIM OF THE DELL AND FADING LIKE GHOSTS INTO THE BROKEN COUNTRY ON THE BORDERS OF THE ROAD THE MOON WAS NOW THREE NIGHTS FROM THE FULL BUT IT DID NOT CLIMB OVER THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL NEARLY MIDNIGHT AND THE EARLY NIGHT WAS VERY DARK A SINGLE RED LIGHT BURNED HIGH UP IN THE TOWERS OF THE TEETH BUT OTHERWISE NO SIGN COULD BE SEEN OR HEARD OF THE SLEEPLESS WATCH ON THE MORANNON
FOR MANY MILES THE RED EYE SEEMED TO STARE AT THEM AS THEY FLED STUMBLING THROUGH A BARREN STONY COUNTRY THEY DID NOT DARE TO TAKE THE ROAD BUT THEY KEPT IT ON THEIR LEFT FOLLOWING ITS LINE AS WELL AS THEY COULD AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AT LAST WHEN NIGHT WAS GROWING OLD AND THEY WERE ALREADY WEARY FOR THEY HAD TAKEN ONLY ONE SHORT REST THE EYE DWINDLED TO A SMALL FIERY POINT AND THEN VANISHED THEY HAD TURNED THE DARK NORTHERN SHOULDER OF THE LOWER MOUNTAINS AND WERE HEADING SOUTHWARDS
WITH HEARTS STRANGELY LIGHTENED THEY NOW RESTED AGAIN BUT NOT FOR LONG THEY WERE NOT GOING QUICK ENOUGH FOR GOLLUM BY HIS RECKONING IT WAS NEARLY THIRTY LEAGUES FROM THE MORANNON TO THE CROSSROADS ABOVE OSGILIATH AND HE HOPED TO COVER THAT DISTANCE IN FOUR JOURNEYS SO SOON THEY STRUGGLED ON ONCE MORE UNTIL THE DAWN BEGAN TO SPREAD SLOWLY IN THE WIDE GREY SOLITUDE THEY HAD THEN WALKED ALMOST EIGHT LEAGUES AND THE HOBBITS COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY FURTHER EVEN IF THEY HAD DARED
THE GROWING LIGHT REVEALED TO THEM A LAND ALREADY LESS BARREN AND RUINOUS THE MOUNTAINS STILL LOOMED UP OMINOUSLY ON THEIR LEFT BUT NEAR AT HAND THEY COULD SEE THE SOUTHWARD ROAD NOW BEARING AWAY FROM THE BLACK ROOTS OF THE HILLS AND SLANTING WESTWARDS BEYOND IT WERE SLOPES COVERED WITH SOMBRE TREES LIKE DARK CLOUDS BUT ALL ABOUT THEM LAY A TUMBLED HEATHLAND GROWN WITH LING AND BROOM AND CORNEL AND OTHER SHRUBS THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW HERE AND THERE THEY SAW KNOTS OF TALL PINETREES THE HEARTS OF THE HOBBITS ROSE AGAIN A LITTLE IN SPITE OF WEARINESS THE AIR WAS FRESH AND FRAGRANT AND IT REMINDED THEM OF THE UPLANDS OF THE NORTHFARTHING FAR AWAY IT SEEMED GOOD TO BE REPRIEVED TO WALK IN A LAND THAT HAD ONLY BEEN FOR A FEW YEARS UNDER THE DOMINION OF THE DARK LORD AND WAS NOT YET FALLEN WHOLLY INTO DECAY BUT THEY DID NOT FORGET THEIR DANGER NOR THE BLACK GATE THAT WAS STILL ALL TOO NEAR HIDDEN THOUGH IT WAS BEHIND THE GLOOMY HEIGHTS THEY LOOKED ABOUT FOR A HIDINGPLACE WHERE THEY COULD SHELTER FROM EVIL EYES WHILE THE LIGHT LASTED
THE DAY PASSED UNEASILY THEY LAY DEEP IN THE HEATHER AND COUNTED OUT THE SLOW HOURS IN WHICH THERE SEEMED LITTLE CHANGE FOR THEY WERE STILL UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE EPHEL DUATH AND THE SUN WAS VEILED FRODO SLEPT AT TIMES DEEPLY AND PEACEFULLY EITHER TRUSTING GOLLUM OR TOO TIRED TO TROUBLE ABOUT HIM BUT SAM FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO DO MORE THAN DOZE EVEN WHEN GOLLUM WAS PLAINLY FAST ASLEEP WHIFFLING AND TWITCHING IN HIS SECRET DREAMS HUNGER PERHAPS MORE THAN MISTRUST KEPT HIM WAKEFUL HE HAD BEGUN TO LONG FOR A GOOD HOMELY MEAL SOMETHING HOT OUT OF THE POT
AS SOON AS THE LAND FADED INTO A FORMLESS GREY UNDER COMING NIGHT THEY STARTED OUT AGAIN IN A LITTLE WHILE GOLLUM LED THEM DOWN ON TO THE SOUTHWARD ROAD AND AFTER THAT THEY WENT ON MORE QUICKLY THOUGH THE DANGER WAS GREATER THEIR EARS WERE STRAINED FOR THE SOUND OF HOOF OR FOOT ON THE ROAD AHEAD OR FOLLOWING THEM FROM BEHIND BUT THE NIGHT PASSED AND THEY HEARD NO SOUND OF WALKER OR RIDER
THE ROAD HAD BEEN MADE IN A LONG LOST TIME AND FOR PERHAPS THIRTY MILES BELOW THE MORANNON IT HAD BEEN NEWLY REPAIRED BUT AS IT WENT SOUTH THE WILD ENCROACHED UPON IT THE HANDIWORK OF MEN OF OLD COULD STILL BE SEEN IN ITS STRAIGHT SURE FLIGHT AND LEVEL COURSE NOW AND AGAIN IT CUT ITS WAY THROUGH HILLSIDE SLOPES OR LEAPED OVER A STREAM UPON A WIDE SHAPELY ARCH OF ENDURING MASONRY BUT AT LAST ALL SIGNS OF STONEWORK FADED SAVE FOR A BROKEN PILLAR HERE AND THERE PEERING OUT OF BUSHES AT THE SIDE OR OLD PAVINGSTONES STILL LURKING AMID WEEDS AND MOSS HEATHER AND TREES AND BRACKEN SCRAMBLED DOWN AND OVERHUNG THE BANKS OR SPRAWLED OUT OVER THE SURFACE IT DWINDLED AT LAST TO A COUNTRY CARTROAD LITTLE USED BUT IT DID NOT WIND IT HELD ON ITS OWN SURE COURSE AND GUIDED THEM BY THE SWIFTEST WAY
SO THEY PASSED INTO THE NORTHERN MARCHES OF THAT LAND THAT MEN ONCE CALLED ITHILIEN A FAIR COUNTRY OF CLIMBING WOODS AND SWIFTFALLING STREAMS THE NIGHT BECAME FINE UNDER STAR AND ROUND MOON AND IT SEEMED TO THE HOBBITS THAT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE AIR GREW AS THEY WENT FORWARD AND FROM THE BLOWING AND MUTTERING OF GOLLUM IT SEEMED THAT HE NOTICED IT TOO AND DID NOT RELISH IT AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF DAY THEY HALTED AGAIN THEY HAD COME TO THE END OF A LONG CUTTING DEEP AND SHEERSIDED IN THE MIDDLE BY WHICH THE ROAD CLOVE ITS WAY THROUGH A STONY RIDGE NOW THEY CLIMBED UP THE WESTWARD BANK AND LOOKED ABROAD
DAY WAS OPENING IN THE SKY AND THEY SAW THAT THE MOUNTAINS WERE NOW MUCH FURTHER OFF RECEDING EASTWARD IN A LONG CURVE THAT WAS LOST IN THE DISTANCE BEFORE THEM AS THEY TURNED WEST GENTLE SLOPES RAN DOWN INTO DIM HAZES FAR BELOW ALL ABOUT THEM WERE SMALL WOODS OF RESINOUS TREES FIR AND CEDAR AND CYPRESS AND OTHER KINDS UNKNOWN IN THE SHIRE WITH WIDE GLADES AMONG THEM AND EVERYWHERE THERE WAS A WEALTH OF SWEETSMELLING HERBS AND SHRUBS THE LONG JOURNEY FROM RIVENDELL HAD BROUGHT THEM FAR SOUTH OF THEIR OWN LAND BUT NOT UNTIL NOW IN THIS MORE SHELTERED REGION HAD THE HOBBITS FELT THE CHANGE OF CLIME HERE SPRING WAS ALREADY BUSY ABOUT THEM FRONDS PIERCED MOSS AND MOULD LARCHES WERE GREENFINGERED SMALL FLOWERS WERE OPENING IN THE TURF BIRDS WERE SINGING ITHILIEN THE GARDEN OF GONDOR NOW DESOLATE KEPT STILL A DISHEVELLED DRYAD LOVELINESS
SOUTH AND WEST IT LOOKED TOWARDS THE WARM LOWER VALES OF ANDUIN SHIELDED FROM THE EAST BY THE EPHEL DUATH AND YET NOT UNDER THE MOUNTAINSHADOW PROTECTED FROM THE NORTH BY THE EMYN MUIL OPEN TO THE SOUTHERN AIRS AND THE MOIST WINDS FROM THE SEA FAR AWAY MANY GREAT TREES GREW THERE PLANTED LONG AGO FALLING INTO UNTENDED AGE AMID A RIOT OF CARELESS DESCENDANTS AND GROVES AND THICKETS THERE WERE OF TAMARISK AND PUNGENT TEREBINTH OF OLIVE AND OF BAY AND THERE WERE JUNIPERS AND MYRTLES AND THYMES THAT GREW IN BUSHES OR WITH THEIR WOODY CREEPING STEMS MANTLED IN DEEP TAPESTRIES THE HIDDEN STONES SAGES OF MANY KINDS PUTTING FORTH BLUE FLOWERS OR RED OR PALE GREEN AND MARJORAMS AND NEWSPROUTING PARSLEYS AND MANY HERBS OF FORMS AND SCENTS BEYOND THE GARDENLORE OF SAM THE GROTS AND ROCKY WALLS WERE ALREADY STARRED WITH SAXIFRAGES AND STONECROPS PRIMEROLES AND ANEMONES WERE AWAKE IN THE FILBERTBRAKES AND ASPHODEL AND MANY LILYFLOWERS NODDED THEIR HALFOPENED HEADS IN THE GRASS DEEP GREEN GRASS BESIDE THE POOLS WHERE FALLING STREAMS HALTED IN COOL HOLLOWS ON THEIR JOURNEY DOWN TO ANDUIN
THE TRAVELLERS TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE ROAD AND WENT DOWNHILL AS THEY WALKED BRUSHING THEIR WAY THROUGH BUSH AND HERB SWEET ODOURS ROSE ABOUT THEM GOLLUM COUGHED AND RETCHED BUT THE HOBBITS BREATHED DEEP AND SUDDENLY SAM LAUGHED FOR HEARTS EASE NOT FOR JEST THEY FOLLOWED A STREAM THAT WENT QUICKLY DOWN BEFORE THEM PRESENTLY IT BROUGHT THEM TO A SMALL CLEAR LAKE IN A SHALLOW DELL IT LAY IN THE BROKEN RUINS OF AN ANCIENT STONE BASIN THE CARVEN RIM OF WHICH WAS ALMOST WHOLLY COVERED WITH MOSSES AND ROSEBRAMBLES IRISSWORDS STOOD IN RANKS ABOUT IT AND WATERLILY LEAVES FLOATED ON ITS DARK GENTLYRIPPLING SURFACE BUT IT WAS DEEP AND FRESH AND SPILLED EVER SOFTLY OUT OVER A STONY LIP AT THE FAR END
HERE THEY WASHED THEMSELVES AND DRANK THEIR FILL AT THE INFALLING FRESHET THEN THEY SOUGHT FOR A RESTINGPLACE AND A HIDINGPLACE FOR THIS LAND FAIRSEEMING STILL WAS NONETHELESS NOW TERRITORY OF THE ENEMY THEY HAD NOT COME VERY FAR FROM THE ROAD AND YET EVEN IN SO SHORT A SPACE THEY HAD SEEN SCARS OF THE OLD WARS AND THE NEWER WOUNDS MADE BY THE ORCS AND OTHER FOUL SERVANTS OF THE DARK LORD A PIT OF UNCOVERED FILTH AND REFUSE TREES HEWN DOWN WANTONLY AND LEFT TO DIE WITH EVIL RUNES OR THE FELL SIGN OF THE EYE CUT IN RUDE STROKES ON THEIR BARK
SAM SCRAMBLING BELOW THE OUTFALL OF THE LAKE SMELLING AND TOUCHING THE UNFAMILIAR PLANTS AND TREES FORGETFUL FOR THE MOMENT OF MORDOR WAS REMINDED SUDDENLY OF THEIR EVERPRESENT PERIL HE STUMBLED ON A RING STILL SCORCHED BY FIRE AND IN THE MIDST OF IT HE FOUND A PILE OF CHARRED AND BROKEN BONES AND SKULLS THE SWIFT GROWTH OF THE WILD WITH BRIAR AND EGLANTINE AND TRAILING CLEMATIS WAS ALREADY DRAWING A VEIL OVER THIS PLACE OF DREADFUL FEAST AND SLAUGHTER BUT IT WAS NOT ANCIENT HE HURRIED BACK TO HIS COMPANIONS BUT HE SAID NOTHING THE BONES WERE BEST LEFT IN PEACE AND NOT PAWED AND ROUTED BY GOLLUM
LETS FIND A PLACE TO LIE UP IN HE SAID NOT LOWER DOWN HIGHER UP FOR ME
A LITTLE WAY BACK ABOVE THE LAKE THEY FOUND A DEEP BROWN BED OF LAST YEARS FERN BEYOND IT WAS A THICKET OF DARKLEAVED BAYTREES CLIMBING UP A STEEP BANK THAT WAS CROWNED WITH OLD CEDARS HERE THEY DECIDED TO REST AND PASS THE DAY WHICH ALREADY PROMISED TO BE BRIGHT AND WARM A GOOD DAY FOR STROLLING ON THEIR WAY ALONG THE GROVES AND GLADES OF ITHILIEN BUT THOUGH ORCS MAY SHUN THE SUNLIGHT THERE WERE TOO MANY PLACES HERE WHERE THEY COULD LIE HID AND WATCH AND OTHER EVIL EYES WERE ABROAD SAURON HAD MANY SERVANTS GOLLUM IN ANY CASE WOULD NOT MOVE UNDER THE YELLOW FACE SOON IT WOULD LOOK OVER THE DARK RIDGES OF THE EPHEL DUATH AND HE WOULD FAINT AND COWER IN THE LIGHT AND HEAT
SAM HAD BEEN GIVING EARNEST THOUGHT TO FOOD AS THEY MARCHED NOW THAT THE DESPAIR OF THE IMPASSABLE GATE WAS BEHIND HIM HE DID NOT FEEL SO INCLINED AS HIS MASTER TO TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD BEYOND THE END OF THEIR ERRAND AND ANYWAY IT SEEMED WISER TO HIM TO SAVE THE WAYBREAD OF THE ELVES FOR WORSE TIMES AHEAD SIX DAYS OR MORE HAD PASSED SINCE HE RECKONED THAT THEY HAD ONLY A BARE SUPPLY FOR THREE WEEKS
IF WE REACH THE FIRE IN THAT TIME WELL BE LUCKY AT THIS RATE HE THOUGHT AND WE MIGHT BE WANTING TO GET BACK WE MIGHT
BESIDES AT THE END OF A LONG NIGHTMARCH AND AFTER BATHING AND DRINKING HE FELT EVEN MORE HUNGRY THAN USUAL A SUPPER OR A BREAKFAST BY THE FIRE IN THE OLD KITCHEN AT BAGSHOT ROW WAS WHAT HE REALLY WANTED AN IDEA STRUCK HIM AND HE TURNED TO GOLLUM GOLLUM HAD JUST BEGUN TO SNEAK OFF ON HIS OWN AND HE WAS CRAWLING AWAY ON ALL FOURS THROUGH THE FERN

GOLLUM DISAPPEARED HE WAS AWAY SOME TIME AND FRODO AFTER A FEW MOUTHFULS OF LEMBAS SETTLED DEEP INTO THE BROWN FERN AND WENT TO SLEEP SAM LOOKED AT HIM THE EARLY DAYLIGHT WAS ONLY JUST CREEPING DOWN INTO THE SHADOWS UNDER THE TREES BUT HE SAW HIS MASTERS FACE VERY CLEARLY AND HIS HANDS TOO LYING AT REST ON THE GROUND BESIDE HIM HE WAS REMINDED SUDDENLY OF FRODO AS HE HAD LAIN ASLEEP IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND AFTER HIS DEADLY WOUND THEN AS HE HAD KEPT WATCH SAM HAD NOTICED THAT AT TIMES A LIGHT SEEMED TO BE SHINING FAINTLY WITHIN BUT NOW THE LIGHT WAS EVEN CLEARER AND STRONGER FRODOS FACE WAS PEACEFUL THE MARKS OF FEAR AND CARE HAD LEFT IT BUT IT LOOKED OLD OLD AND BEAUTIFUL AS IF THE CHISELLING OF THE SHAPING YEARS WAS NOW REVEALED IN MANY FINE LINES THAT HAD BEFORE BEEN HIDDEN THOUGH THE IDENTITY OF THE FACE WAS NOT CHANGED NOT THAT SAM GAMGEE PUT IT THAT WAY TO HIMSELF HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF FINDING WORDS USELESS AND MURMURED I LOVE HIM HES LIKE THAT AND SOMETIMES IT SHINES THROUGH SOMEHOW BUT I LOVE HIM WHETHER OR NO
GOLLUM RETURNED QUIETLY AND PEERED OVER SAMS SHOULDER LOOKING AT FRODO HE SHUT HIS EYES AND CRAWLED AWAY WITHOUT A SOUND SAM CAME TO HIM A MOMENT LATER AND FOUND HIM CHEWING SOMETHING AND MUTTERING TO HIMSELF ON THE GROUND BESIDE HIM LAY TWO SMALL RABBITS WHICH HE WAS BEGINNING TO EYE GREEDILY
SMEAGOL ALWAYS HELPS HE SAID HE HAS BROUGHT RABBITS NICE RABBITS BUT MASTER HAS GONE TO SLEEP AND PERHAPS SAM WANTS TO SLEEP DOESNT WANT RABBITS NOW SMEAGOL TRIES TO HELP BUT HE CANT CATCH THINGS ALL IN A MINUTE

WHEN HE THOUGHT ALL WAS READY HE LIFTED THE PANS OFF THE FIRE AND CREPT ALONG TO FRODO FRODO HALF OPENED HIS EYES AS SAM STOOD OVER HIM AND THEN HE WAKENED FROM HIS DREAMING ANOTHER GENTLE UNRECOVERABLE DREAM OF PEACE

THEY FINISHED AND SAM WENT OFF TO THE STREAM TO RINSE HIS GEAR AS HE STOOD UP TO RETURN HE LOOKED BACK UP THE SLOPE AT THAT MOMENT HE SAW THE SUN RISE OUT OF THE REEK OR HAZE OR DARK SHADOW OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT LAY EVER TO THE EAST AND IT SENT ITS GOLDEN BEAMS DOWN UPON THE TREES AND GLADES ABOUT HIM THEN HE NOTICED A THIN SPIRAL OF BLUEGREY SMOKE PLAIN TO SEE AS IT CAUGHT THE SUNLIGHT RISING FROM A THICKET ABOVE HIM WITH A SHOCK HE REALIZED THAT THIS WAS THE SMOKE FROM HIS LITTLE COOKINGFIRE WHICH HE HAD NEGLECTED TO PUT OUT
THAT WONT DO NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD SHOW LIKE THAT HE MUTTERED AND HE STARTED TO HURRY BACK SUDDENLY HE HALTED AND LISTENED HAD HE HEARD A WHISTLE OR NOT OR WAS IT THE CALL OF SOME STRANGE BIRD IF IT WAS A WHISTLE IT DID NOT COME FROM FRODOS DIRECTION THERE IT WENT AGAIN FROM ANOTHER PLACE SAM BEGAN TO RUN AS WELL AS HE COULD UPHILL
HE FOUND THAT A SMALL BRAND BURNING AWAY TO ITS OUTER END HAD KINDLED SOME FERN AT THE EDGE OF THE FIRE AND THE FERN BLAZING UP HAD SET THE TURVES SMOULDERING HASTILY HE STAMPED OUT WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE FIRE SCATTERED THE ASHES AND LAID THE TURVES ON THE HOLE THEN HE CREPT BACK TO FRODO

THE HOBBITS SAT DOWN AGAIN BUT THEY SAID NOTHING TO ONE ANOTHER OF THEIR THOUGHTS AND DOUBTS CLOSE BY JUST UNDER THE DAPPLING SHADOW OF THE DARK BAYTREES TWO MEN REMAINED ON GUARD THEY TOOK OFF THEIR MASKS NOW AND AGAIN TO COOL THEM AS THE DAYHEAT GREW AND FRODO SAW THAT THEY WERE GOODLY MEN PALESKINNED DARK OF HAIR WITH GREY EYES AND FACES SAD AND PROUD THEY SPOKE TOGETHER IN SOFT VOICES AT FIRST USING THE COMMON SPEECH BUT AFTER THE MANNER OF OLDER DAYS AND THEN CHANGING TO ANOTHER LANGUAGE OF THEIR OWN TO HIS AMAZEMENT AS HE LISTENED FRODO BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS THE ELVENTONGUE THAT THEY SPOKE OR ONE BUT LITTLE DIFFERENT AND HE LOOKED AT THEM WITH WONDER FOR HE KNEW THEN THAT THEY MUST BE DUNEDAIN OF THE SOUTH MEN OF THE LINE OF THE LORDS OF WESTERNESSE
AFTER A WHILE HE SPOKE TO THEM BUT THEY WERE SLOW AND CAUTIOUS IN ANSWERING THEY NAMED THEMSELVES MABLUNG AND DAMROD SOLDIERS OF GONDOR AND THEY WERE RANGERS OF ITHILIEN FOR THEY WERE DESCENDED FROM FOLK WHO LIVED IN ITHILIEN AT ONE TIME BEFORE IT WAS OVERRUN FROM SUCH MEN THE LORD DENETHOR CHOSE HIS FORAYERS WHO CROSSED THE ANDUIN SECRETLY HOW OR WHERE THEY WOULD NOT SAY TO HARRY THE ORCS AND OTHER ENEMIES THAT ROAMED BETWEEN THE EPHEL DUATH AND THE RIVER
IT IS CLOSE ON TEN LEAGUES HENCE TO THE EASTSHORE OF ANDUIN SAID MABLUNG AND WE SELDOM COME SO FAR AFIELD BUT WE HAVE A NEW ERRAND ON THIS JOURNEY WE COME TO AMBUSH THE MEN OF HARAD CURSE THEM
AYE CURSE THE SOUTHRONS SAID DAMROD TIS SAID THAT THERE WERE DEALINGS OF OLD BETWEEN GONDOR AND THE KINGDOMS OF THE HARAD IN THE FAR SOUTH THOUGH THERE WAS NEVER FRIENDSHIP IN THOSE DAYS OUR BOUNDS WERE AWAY SOUTH BEYOND THE MOUTHS OF ANDUIN AND UMBAR THE NEAREST OF THEIR REALMS ACKNOWLEDGED OUR SWAY BUT THAT IS LONG SINCE TIS MANY LIVES OF MEN SINCE ANY PASSED TO OR FRO BETWEEN US NOW OF LATE WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE ENEMY HAS BEEN AMONG THEM AND THEY ARE GONE OVER TO HIM OR BACK TO HIM  THEY WERE EVER READY TO HIS WILL  AS HAVE SO MANY ALSO IN THE EAST I DOUBT NOT THAT THE DAYS OF GONDOR ARE NUMBERED AND THE WALLS OF MINAS TIRITH ARE DOOMED SO GREAT IS HIS STRENGTH AND MALICE
BUT STILL WE WILL NOT SIT IDLE AND LET HIM DO ALL AS HE WOULD SAID MABLUNG THESE CURSED SOUTHRONS COME NOW MARCHING UP THE ANCIENT ROADS TO SWELL THE HOSTS OF THE DARK TOWER YEA UP THE VERY ROADS THAT CRAFT OF GONDOR MADE AND THEY GO EVER MORE HEEDLESSLY WE LEARN THINKING THAT THE POWER OF THEIR NEW MASTER IS GREAT ENOUGH SO THAT THE MERE SHADOW OF HIS HILLS WILL PROTECT THEM WE COME TO TEACH THEM ANOTHER LESSON GREAT STRENGTH OF THEM WAS REPORTED TO US SOME DAYS AGO MARCHING NORTH ONE OF THEIR REGIMENTS IS DUE BY OUR RECKONING TO PASS BY SOME TIME ERE NOONUP ON THE ROAD ABOVE WHERE IT PASSES THROUGH THE CLOVEN WAY THE ROAD MAY PASS BUT THEY SHALL NOT NOT WHILE FARAMIR IS CAPTAIN HE LEADS NOW IN ALL PERILOUS VENTURES BUT HIS LIFE IS CHARMED OR FATE SPARES HIM FOR SOME OTHER END
THEIR TALK DIED DOWN INTO A LISTENING SILENCE ALL SEEMED STILL AND WATCHFUL SAM CROUCHED BY THE EDGE OF THE FERNBRAKE PEERED OUT WITH HIS KEEN HOBBITEYES HE SAW THAT MANY MORE MEN WERE ABOUT HE COULD SEE THEM STEALING UP THE SLOPES SINGLY OR IN LONG FILES KEEPING ALWAYS TO THE SHADE OF GROVE OR THICKET OR CRAWLING HARDLY VISIBLE IN THEIR BROWN AND GREEN RAIMENT THROUGH GRASS AND BRAKE ALL WERE HOODED AND MASKED AND HAD GAUNTLETS ON THEIR HANDS AND WERE ARMED LIKE FARAMIR AND HIS COMPANIONS BEFORE LONG THEY HAD ALL PASSED AND VANISHED THE SUN ROSE TILL IT NEARED THE SOUTH THE SHADOWS SHRANK
I WONDER WHERE THAT DRATTED GOLLUM IS THOUGHT SAM AS HE CRAWLED BACK INTO DEEPER SHADE HE STANDS A FAIR CHANCE OF BEING SPITTED FOR AN ORC OR OF BEING ROASTED BY THE YELLOW FACE BUT I FANCY HELL LOOK AFTER HIMSELF HE LAY DOWN BESIDE FRODO AND BEGAN TO DOZE
HE WOKE THINKING THAT HE HAD HEARD HORNS BLOWING HE SAT UP IT WAS NOW HIGH NOON THE GUARDS STOOD ALERT AND TENSE IN THE SHADOW OF THE TREES SUDDENLY THE HORNS RANG OUT LOUDER AND BEYOND MISTAKE FROM ABOVE OVER THE TOP OF THE SLOPE SAM THOUGHT THAT HE HEARD CRIES AND WILD SHOUTING ALSO BUT THE SOUND WAS FAINT AS IF IT CAME OUT OF SOME DISTANT CAVE THEN PRESENTLY THE NOISE OF FIGHTING BROKE OUT NEAR AT HAND JUST ABOVE THEIR HIDINGPLACE HE COULD HEAR PLAINLY THE RINGING GRATE OF STEEL ON STEEL THE CLANG OF SWORD ON IRON CAP THE DULL BEAT OF BLADE ON SHIELD MEN WERE YELLING AND SCREAMING AND ONE CLEAR LOUD VOICE WAS CALLING GONDOR GONDOR

SAM EAGER TO SEE MORE WENT NOW AND JOINED THE GUARDS HE SCRAMBLED A LITTLE WAY UP INTO ONE OF THE LARGER OF THE BAYTREES FOR A MOMENT HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF SWARTHY MEN IN RED RUNNING DOWN THE SLOPE SOME WAY OFF WITH GREENCLAD WARRIORS LEAPING AFTER THEM HEWING THEM DOWN AS THEY FLED ARROWS WERE THICK IN THE AIR THEN SUDDENLY STRAIGHT OVER THE RIM OF THEIR SHELTERING BANK A MAN FELL CRASHING THROUGH THE SLENDER TREES NEARLY ON TOP OF THEM HE CAME TO REST IN THE FERN A FEW FEET AWAY FACE DOWNWARD GREEN ARROWFEATHERS STICKING FROM HIS NECK BELOW A GOLDEN COLLAR HIS SCARLET ROBES WERE TATTERED HIS CORSLET OF OVERLAPPING BRAZEN PLATES WAS RENT AND HEWN HIS BLACK PLAITS OF HAIR BRAIDED WITH GOLD WERE DRENCHED WITH BLOOD HIS BROWN HAND STILL CLUTCHED THE HILT OF A BROKEN SWORD
IT WAS SAMS FIRST VIEW OF A BATTLE OF MEN AGAINST MEN AND HE DID NOT LIKE IT MUCH HE WAS GLAD THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE DEAD FACE HE WONDERED WHAT THE MANS NAME WAS AND WHERE HE CAME FROM AND IF HE WAS REALLY EVIL OF HEART OR WHAT LIES OR THREATS HAD LED HIM ON THE LONG MARCH FROM HIS HOME AND IF HE WOULD NOT REALLY RATHER HAVE STAYED THERE IN PEACE  ALL IN A FLASH OF THOUGHT WHICH WAS QUICKLY DRIVEN FROM HIS MIND FOR JUST AS MABLUNG STEPPED TOWARDS THE FALLEN BODY THERE WAS A NEW NOISE GREAT CRYING AND SHOUTING AMIDST IT SAM HEARD A SHRILL BELLOWING OR TRUMPETING AND THEN A GREAT THUDDING AND BUMPING LIKE HUGE RAMS DINNING ON THE GROUND

CHAPTER 5
THE WINDOW ON THE WEST

IT SEEMED TO SAM THAT HE HAD ONLY DOZED FOR A FEW MINUTES WHEN HE AWOKE TO FIND THAT IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON AND FARAMIR HAD COME BACK HE HAD BROUGHT MANY MEN WITH HIM INDEED ALL THE SURVIVORS OF THE FORAY WERE NOW GATHERED ON THE SLOPE NEARBY TWO OR THREE HUNDRED STRONG THEY SAT IN A WIDE SEMICIRCLE BETWEEN THE ARMS OF WHICH FARAMIR WAS SEATED ON THE GROUND WHILE FRODO STOOD BEFORE HIM IT LOOKED STRANGELY LIKE THE TRIAL OF A PRISONER
SAM CREPT OUT FROM THE FERN BUT NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HIM AND HE PLACED HIMSELF AT THE END OF THE ROWS OF MEN WHERE HE COULD SEE AND HEAR ALL THAT WAS GOING ON HE WATCHED AND LISTENED INTENTLY READY TO DASH TO HIS MASTERS AID IF NEEDED HE COULD SEE FARAMIRS FACE WHICH WAS NOW UNMASKED IT WAS STERN AND COMMANDING AND A KEEN WIT LAY BEHIND HIS SEARCHING GLANCE DOUBT WAS IN THE GREY EYES THAT GAZED STEADILY AT FRODO
SAM SOON BECAME AWARE THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH FRODOS ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF AT SEVERAL POINTS WHAT PART HE HAD TO PLAY IN THE COMPANY THAT SET OUT FROM RIVENDELL WHY HE HAD LEFT BOROMIR AND WHERE HE WAS NOW GOING IN PARTICULAR HE RETURNED OFTEN TO ISILDURS BANE PLAINLY HE SAW THAT FRODO WAS CONCEALING FROM HIM SOME MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
BUT IT WAS AT THE COMING OF THE HALFLING THAT ISILDURS BANE SHOULD WAKEN OR SO ONE MUST READ THE WORDS HE INSISTED IF THEN YOU ARE THE HALFLING THAT WAS NAMED DOUBTLESS YOU BROUGHT THIS THING WHATEVER IT MAY BE TO THE COUNCIL OF WHICH YOU SPEAK AND THERE BOROMIR SAW IT DO YOU DENY IT
FRODO MADE NO ANSWER SO SAID FARAMIR I WISH THEN TO LEARN FROM YOU MORE OF IT FOR WHAT CONCERNS BOROMIR CONCERNS ME AN ORCARROW SLEW ISILDUR SO FAR AS OLD TALES TELL BUT ORCARROWS ARE PLENTY AND THE SIGHT OF ONE WOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS A SIGN OF DOOM BY BOROMIR OF GONDOR HAD YOU THIS THING IN KEEPING IT IS HIDDEN YOU SAY BUT IS NOT THAT BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE TO HIDE IT
NO NOT BECAUSE I CHOOSE ANSWERED FRODO IT DOES NOT BELONG TO ME IT DOES NOT BELONG TO ANY MORTAL GREAT OR SMALL THOUGH IF ANY COULD CLAIM IT IT WOULD BE ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN WHOM I NAMED THE LEADER OF OUR COMPANY FROM MORIA TO RAUROS
WHY SO AND NOT BOROMIR PRINCE OF THE CITY THAT THE SONS OF ELENDIL FOUNDED
BECAUSE ARAGORN IS DESCENDED IN DIRECT LINEAGE FATHER TO FATHER FROM ISILDUR ELENDILS SON HIMSELF AND THE SWORD THAT HE BEARS WAS ELENDILS SWORD
A MURMUR OF ASTONISHMENT RAN THROUGH ALL THE RING OF MEN SOME CRIED ALOUD THE SWORD OF ELENDIL THE SWORD OF ELENDIL COMES TO MINAS TIRITH GREAT TIDINGS BUT FARAMIRS FACE WAS UNMOVED
MAYBE HE SAID BUT SO GREAT A CLAIM WILL NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED AND CLEAR PROOFS WILL BE REQUIRED SHOULD THIS ARAGORN EVER COME TO MINAS TIRITH HE HAD NOT COME NOR ANY OF YOUR COMPANY WHEN I SET OUT SIX DAYS AGO
BOROMIR WAS SATISFIED OF THAT CLAIM SAID FRODO INDEED IF BOROMIR WERE HERE HE WOULD ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS AND SINCE HE WAS ALREADY AT RAUROS MANY DAYS BACK AND INTENDED THEN TO GO STRAIGHT TO YOUR CITY IF YOU RETURN YOU MAY SOON LEARN THE ANSWERS THERE MY PART IN THE COMPANY WAS KNOWN TO HIM AS TO ALL THE OTHERS FOR IT WAS APPOINTED TO ME BY ELROND OF IMLADRIS HIMSELF BEFORE THE WHOLE COUNCIL ON THAT ERRAND I CAME INTO THIS COUNTRY BUT IT IS NOT MINE TO REVEAL TO ANY OUTSIDE THE COMPANY YET THOSE WHO CLAIM TO OPPOSE THE ENEMY WOULD DO WELL NOT TO HINDER IT
FRODOS TONE WAS PROUD WHATEVER HE FELT AND SAM APPROVED OF IT BUT IT DID NOT APPEASE FARAMIR
SO HE SAID YOU BID ME MIND MY OWN AFFAIRS AND GET ME BACK HOME AND LET YOU BE BOROMIR WILL TELL ALL WHEN HE COMES WHEN HE COMES SAY YOU WERE YOU A FRIEND OF BOROMIR
VIVIDLY BEFORE FRODOS MIND CAME THE MEMORY OF BOROMIRS ASSAULT UPON HIM AND FOR A MOMENT HE HESITATED FARAMIRS EYES WATCHING HIM GREW HARDER BOROMIR WAS A VALIANT MEMBER OF OUR COMPANY SAID FRODO AT LENGTH YES I WAS HIS FRIEND FOR MY PART
FARAMIR SMILED GRIMLY THEN YOU WOULD GRIEVE TO LEARN THAT BOROMIR IS DEAD
I WOULD GRIEVE INDEED SAID FRODO THEN CATCHING THE LOOK IN FARAMIRS EYES HE FALTERED DEAD HE SAID DO YOU MEAN THAT HE IS DEAD AND THAT YOU KNEW IT YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TRAP ME IN WORDS PLAYING WITH ME OR ARE YOU NOW TRYING TO SNARE ME WITH A FALSEHOOD
I WOULD NOT SNARE EVEN AN ORC WITH A FALSEHOOD SAID FARAMIR
HOW THEN DID HE DIE AND HOW DO YOU KNOW OF IT SINCE YOU SAY THAT NONE OF THE COMPANY HAD REACHED THE CITY WHEN YOU LEFT
AS TO THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH I HAD HOPED THAT HIS FRIEND AND COMPANION WOULD TELL ME HOW IT WAS
BUT HE WAS ALIVE AND STRONG WHEN WE PARTED AND HE LIVES STILL FOR ALL THAT I KNOW THOUGH SURELY THERE ARE MANY PERILS IN THE WORLD
MANY INDEED SAID FARAMIR AND TREACHERY NOT THE LEAST
SAM HAD BEEN GETTING MORE AND MORE IMPATIENT AND ANGRY AT THIS CONVERSATION THESE LAST WORDS WERE MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR AND BURSTING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE RING HE STRODE UP TO HIS MASTERS SIDE
BEGGING YOUR PARDON MR FRODO HE SAID BUT THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH HES NO RIGHT TO TALK TO YOU SO AFTER ALL YOUVE GONE THROUGH AS MUCH FOR HIS GOOD AND ALL THESE GREAT MEN AS FOR ANYONE ELSE
SEE HERE CAPTAIN HE PLANTED HIMSELF SQUARELY IN FRONT OF FARAMIR HIS HANDS ON HIS HIPS AND A LOOK ON HIS FACE AS IF HE WAS ADDRESSING A YOUNG HOBBIT WHO HAD OFFERED HIM WHAT HE CALLED SAUCE WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT VISITS TO THE ORCHARD THERE WAS SOME MURMURING BUT ALSO SOME GRINS ON THE FACES OF THE MEN LOOKING ON THE SIGHT OF THEIR CAPTAIN SITTING ON THE GROUND AND EYE TO EYE WITH A YOUNG HOBBIT LEGS WELL APART BRISTLING WITH WRATH WAS ONE BEYOND THEIR EXPERIENCE SEE HERE HE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT LETS COME TO THE POINT BEFORE ALL THE ORCS OF MORDOR COME DOWN ON US IF YOU THINK MY MASTER MURDERED THIS BOROMIR AND THEN RAN AWAY YOUVE GOT NO SENSE BUT SAY IT AND HAVE DONE AND THEN LET US KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO ABOUT IT BUT ITS A PITY THAT FOLK AS TALK ABOUT FIGHTING THE ENEMY CANT LET OTHERS DO THEIR BIT IN THEIR OWN WAY WITHOUT INTERFERING HED BE MIGHTY PLEASED IF HE COULD SEE YOU NOW THINK HED GOT A NEW FRIEND HE WOULD
PATIENCE SAID FARAMIR BUT WITHOUT ANGER DO NOT SPEAK BEFORE YOUR MASTER WHOSE WIT IS GREATER THAN YOURS AND I DO NOT NEED ANY TO TEACH ME OF OUR PERIL EVEN SO I SPARE A BRIEF TIME IN ORDER TO JUDGE JUSTLY IN A HARD MATTER WERE I AS HASTY AS YOU I MIGHT HAVE SLAIN YOU LONG AGO FOR I AM COMMANDED TO SLAY ALL WHOM I FIND IN THIS LAND WITHOUT THE LEAVE OF THE LORD OF GONDOR BUT I DO NOT SLAY MAN OR BEAST NEEDLESSLY AND NOT GLADLY EVEN WHEN IT IS NEEDED NEITHER DO I TALK IN VAIN SO BE COMFORTED SIT BY YOUR MASTER AND BE SILENT
SAM SAT DOWN HEAVILY WITH A RED FACE FARAMIR TURNED TO FRODO AGAIN YOU ASKED HOW DO I KNOW THAT THE SON OF DENETHOR IS DEAD TIDINGS OF DEATH HAVE MANY WINGS NIGHT OFT BRINGS NEWS TO NEAR KINDRED TIS SAID BOROMIR WAS MY BROTHER
A SHADOW OF SORROW PASSED OVER HIS FACE DO YOU REMEMBER AUGHT OF SPECIAL MARK THAT THE LORD BOROMIR BORE WITH HIM AMONG HIS GEAR
FRODO THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT FEARING SOME FURTHER TRAP AND WONDERING HOW THIS DEBATE WOULD TURN IN THE END HE HAD HARDLY SAVED THE RING FROM THE PROUD GRASP OF BOROMIR AND HOW HE WOULD FARE NOW AMONG SO MANY MEN WARLIKE AND STRONG HE DID NOT KNOW YET HE FELT IN HIS HEART THAT FARAMIR THOUGH HE WAS MUCH LIKE HIS BROTHER IN LOOKS WAS A MAN LESS SELFREGARDING BOTH STERNER AND WISER I REMEMBER THAT BOROMIR BORE A HORN HE SAID AT LAST
YOU REMEMBER WELL AND AS ONE WHO HAS IN TRUTH SEEN HIM SAID FARAMIR THEN MAYBE YOU CAN SEE IT IN YOUR MINDS EYE A GREAT HORN OF THE WILD OX OF THE EAST BOUND WITH SILVER AND WRITTEN WITH ANCIENT CHARACTERS THAT HORN THE ELDEST SON OF OUR HOUSE HAS BORNE FOR MANY GENERATIONS AND IT IS SAID THAT IF IT BE BLOWN AT NEED ANYWHERE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF GONDOR AS THE REALM WAS OF OLD ITS VOICE WILL NOT PASS UNHEEDED
FIVE DAYS ERE I SET OUT ON THIS VENTURE ELEVEN DAYS AGO AT ABOUT THIS HOUR OF THE DAY I HEARD THE BLOWING OF THAT HORN FROM THE NORTHWARD IT SEEMED BUT DIM AS IF IT WERE BUT AN ECHO IN THE MIND A BODING OF ILL WE THOUGHT IT MY FATHER AND I FOR NO TIDINGS HAD WE HEARD OF BOROMIR SINCE HE WENT AWAY AND NO WATCHER ON OUR BORDERS HAD SEEN HIM PASS AND ON THE THIRD NIGHT AFTER ANOTHER AND A STRANGER THING BEFELL ME
I SAT AT NIGHT BY THE WATERS OF ANDUIN IN THE GREY DARK UNDER THE YOUNG PALE MOON WATCHING THE EVERMOVING STREAM AND THE SAD REEDS WERE RUSTLING SO DO WE EVER WATCH THE SHORES NIGH OSGILIATH WHICH OUR ENEMIES NOW PARTLY HOLD AND ISSUE FROM IT TO HARRY OUR LANDS BUT THAT NIGHT ALL THE WORLD SLEPT AT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR THEN I SAW OR IT SEEMED THAT I SAW A BOAT FLOATING ON THE WATER GLIMMERING GREY A SMALL BOAT OF A STRANGE FASHION WITH A HIGH PROW AND THERE WAS NONE TO ROW OR STEER IT
AN AWE FELL ON ME FOR A PALE LIGHT WAS ROUND IT BUT I ROSE AND WENT TO THE BANK AND BEGAN TO WALK OUT INTO THE STREAM FOR I WAS DRAWN TOWARDS IT THEN THE BOAT TURNED TOWARDS ME AND STAYED ITS PACE AND FLOATED SLOWLY BY WITHIN MY HANDS REACH YET I DURST NOT HANDLE IT IT WADED DEEP AS IF IT WERE HEAVILY BURDENED AND IT SEEMED TO ME AS IT PASSED UNDER MY GAZE THAT IT WAS ALMOST FILLED WITH CLEAR WATER FROM WHICH CAME THE LIGHT AND LAPPED IN THE WATER A WARRIOR LAY ASLEEP
A BROKEN SWORD WAS ON HIS KNEE I SAW MANY WOUNDS ON HIM IT WAS BOROMIR MY BROTHER DEAD I KNEW HIS GEAR HIS SWORD HIS BELOVED FACE ONE THING ONLY I MISSED HIS HORN ONE THING ONLY I KNEW NOT A FAIR BELT AS IT WERE OF LINKED GOLDEN LEAVES ABOUT HIS WAIST BOROMIR I CRIED WHERE IS THY HORN WHITHER GOEST THOU O BOROMIR BUT HE WAS GONE THE BOAT TURNED INTO THE STREAM AND PASSED GLIMMERING ON INTO THE NIGHT DREAMLIKE IT WAS AND YET NO DREAM FOR THERE WAS NO WAKING AND I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE IS DEAD AND HAS PASSED DOWN THE RIVER TO THE SEA
ALAS SAID FRODO THAT WAS INDEED BOROMIR AS I KNEW HIM FOR THE GOLDEN BELT WAS GIVEN TO HIM IN LOTHLORIEN BY THE LADY GALADRIEL SHE IT WAS THAT CLOTHED US AS YOU SEE US IN ELVENGREY THIS BROOCH IS OF THE SAME WORKMANSHIP HE TOUCHED THE GREEN AND SILVER LEAF THAT FASTENED HIS CLOAK BENEATH HIS THROAT
FARAMIR LOOKED CLOSELY AT IT IT IS BEAUTIFUL HE SAID YES TIS WORK OF THE SAME CRAFT SO THEN YOU PASSED THROUGH THE LAND OF LORIEN LAURELINDORENAN IT WAS NAMED OF OLD BUT LONG NOW IT HAS LAIN BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE OF MEN HE ADDED SOFTLY REGARDING FRODO WITH A NEW WONDER IN HIS EYES MUCH THAT WAS STRANGE ABOUT YOU I BEGIN NOW TO UNDERSTAND WILL YOU NOT TELL ME MORE FOR IT IS A BITTER THOUGHT THAT BOROMIR DIED WITHIN SIGHT OF THE LAND OF HIS HOME
NO MORE CAN I SAY THAN I HAVE SAID ANSWERED FRODO THOUGH YOUR TALE FILLS ME WITH FOREBODING A VISION IT WAS THAT YOU SAW I THINK AND NO MORE SOME SHADOW OF EVIL FORTUNE THAT HAS BEEN OR WILL BE UNLESS INDEED IT IS SOME LYING TRICK OF THE ENEMY I HAVE SEEN THE FACES OF FAIR WARRIORS OF OLD LAID IN SLEEP BENEATH THE POOLS OF THE DEAD MARSHES OR SEEMING SO BY HIS FOUL ARTS
NAY IT WAS NOT SO SAID FARAMIR FOR HIS WORKS FILL THE HEART WITH LOATHING BUT MY HEART WAS FILLED WITH GRIEF AND PITY
YET HOW COULD SUCH A THING HAVE HAPPENED IN TRUTH ASKED FRODO FOR NO BOAT COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OVER THE STONY HILLS FROM TOL BRANDIR AND BOROMIR PURPOSED TO GO HOME ACROSS THE ENTWASH AND THE FIELDS OF ROHAN AND YET HOW COULD ANY VESSEL RIDE THE FOAM OF THE GREAT FALLS AND NOT FOUNDER IN THE BOILING POOLS THOUGH LADEN WITH WATER
I KNOW NOT SAID FARAMIR BUT WHENCE CAME THE BOAT
FROM LORIEN SAID FRODO IN THREE SUCH BOATS WE ROWED DOWN ANDUIN TO THE FALLS THEY ALSO WERE OF ELVENWORK
YOU PASSED THROUGH THE HIDDEN LAND SAID FARAMIR BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOU LITTLE UNDERSTOOD ITS POWER IF MEN HAVE DEALINGS WITH THE MISTRESS OF MAGIC WHO DWELLS IN THE GOLDEN WOOD THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR STRANGE THINGS TO FOLLOW FOR IT IS PERILOUS FOR MORTAL MAN TO WALK OUT OF THE WORLD OF THIS SUN AND FEW OF OLD CAME THENCE UNCHANGED TIS SAID
BOROMIR O BOROMIR HE CRIED WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU THE LADY THAT DIES NOT WHAT DID SHE SEE WHAT WOKE IN YOUR HEART THEN WHY WENT YOU EVER TO LAURELINDORENAN AND CAME NOT BY YOUR OWN ROAD UPON THE HORSES OF ROHAN RIDING HOME IN THE MORNING
THEN TURNING AGAIN TO FRODO HE SPOKE IN A QUIET VOICE ONCE MORE TO THOSE QUESTIONS I GUESS THAT YOU COULD MAKE SOME ANSWER FRODO SON OF DROGO BUT NOT HERE OR NOW MAYBE BUT LEST YOU STILL SHOULD THINK MY TALE A VISION I WILL TELL YOU THIS THE HORN OF BOROMIR AT LEAST RETURNED IN TRUTH AND NOT IN SEEMING THE HORN CAME BUT IT WAS CLOVEN IN TWO AS IT WERE BY AXE OR SWORD THE SHARDS CAME SEVERALLY TO SHORE ONE WAS FOUND AMONG THE REEDS WHERE WATCHERS OF GONDOR LAY NORTHWARDS BELOW THE INFALLS OF THE ENTWASH THE OTHER WAS FOUND SPINNING ON THE FLOOD BY ONE WHO HAD AN ERRAND IN THE WATER STRANGE CHANCES BUT MURDER WILL OUT TIS SAID
AND NOW THE HORN OF THE ELDER SON LIES IN TWO PIECES UPON THE LAP OF DENETHOR SITTING IN HIS HIGH CHAIR WAITING FOR NEWS AND YOU CAN TELL ME NOTHING OF THE CLEAVING OF THE HORN
NO I DID NOT KNOW OF IT SAID FRODO BUT THE DAY WHEN YOU HEARD IT BLOWING IF YOUR RECKONING IS TRUE WAS THE DAY WHEN WE PARTED WHEN I AND MY SERVANT LEFT THE COMPANY AND NOW YOUR TALE FILLS ME WITH DREAD FOR IF BOROMIR WAS THEN IN PERIL AND WAS SLAIN I MUST FEAR THAT ALL MY COMPANIONS PERISHED TOO AND THEY WERE MY KINDRED AND MY FRIENDS
WILL YOU NOT PUT ASIDE YOUR DOUBT OF ME AND LET ME GO I AM WEARY AND FULL OF GRIEF AND AFRAID BUT I HAVE A DEED TO DO OR TO ATTEMPT BEFORE I TOO AM SLAIN AND THE MORE NEED OF HASTE IF WE TWO HALFLINGS ARE ALL THAT REMAIN OF OUR FELLOWSHIP
GO BACK FARAMIR VALIANT CAPTAIN OF GONDOR AND DEFEND YOUR CITY WHILE YOU MAY AND LET ME GO WHERE MY DOOM TAKES ME
FOR ME THERE IS NO COMFORT IN OUR SPEECH TOGETHER SAID FARAMIR BUT YOU SURELY DRAW FROM IT MORE DREAD THAN NEED BE UNLESS THE PEOPLE OF LORIEN THEMSELVES CAME TO HIM WHO ARRAYED BOROMIR AS FOR A FUNERAL NOT ORCS OR SERVANTS OF THE NAMELESS SOME OF YOUR COMPANY I GUESS LIVE STILL
BUT WHATEVER BEFELL ON THE NORTH MARCH YOU FRODO I DOUBT NO LONGER IF HARD DAYS HAVE MADE ME ANY JUDGE OF MENS WORDS AND FACES THEN I MAY MAKE A GUESS AT HALFLINGS THOUGH AND NOW HE SMILED THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT YOU FRODO AN ELVISH AIR MAYBE BUT MORE LIES UPON OUR WORDS TOGETHER THAN I THOUGHT AT FIRST I SHOULD NOW TAKE YOU BACK TO MINAS TIRITH TO ANSWER THERE TO DENETHOR AND MY LIFE WILL JUSTLY BE FORFEIT IF I NOW CHOOSE A COURSE THAT PROVES ILL FOR MY CITY SO I WILL NOT DECIDE IN HASTE WHAT IS TO BE DONE YET WE MUST MOVE HENCE WITHOUT MORE DELAY
HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND ISSUED SOME ORDERS AT ONCE THE MEN WHO WERE GATHERED ROUND HIM BROKE UP INTO SMALL GROUPS AND WENT OFF THIS WAY AND THAT VANISHING QUICKLY INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE ROCKS AND TREES SOON ONLY MABLUNG AND DAMROD REMAINED
NOW YOU FRODO AND SAMWISE WILL COME WITH ME AND MY GUARDS SAID FARAMIR YOU CANNOT GO ALONG THE ROAD SOUTHWARDS IF THAT WAS YOUR PURPOSE IT WILL BE UNSAFE FOR SOME DAYS AND ALWAYS MORE CLOSELY WATCHED AFTER THIS AFFRAY THAN IT HAS BEEN YET AND YOU CANNOT I THINK GO FAR TODAY IN ANY CASE FOR YOU ARE WEARY AND SO ARE WE WE ARE GOING NOW TO A SECRET PLACE WE HAVE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN TEN MILES FROM HERE THE ORCS AND SPIES OF THE ENEMY HAVE NOT FOUND IT YET AND IF THEY DID WE COULD HOLD IT LONG EVEN AGAINST MANY THERE WE MAY LIE UP AND REST FOR A WHILE AND YOU WITH US IN THE MORNING I WILL DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR ME TO DO AND FOR YOU
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR FRODO TO DO BUT TO FALL IN WITH THIS REQUEST OR ORDER IT SEEMED IN ANY CASE A WISE COURSE FOR THE MOMENT SINCE THIS FORAY OF THE MEN OF GONDOR HAD MADE A JOURNEY IN ITHILIEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN EVER
THEY SET OUT AT ONCE MABLUNG AND DAMROD A LITTLE AHEAD AND FARAMIR WITH FRODO AND SAM BEHIND SKIRTING THE HITHER SIDE OF THE POOL WHERE THE HOBBITS HAD BATHED THEY CROSSED THE STREAM CLIMBED A LONG BANK AND PASSED INTO GREENSHADOWED WOODLANDS THAT MARCHED EVER DOWNWARDS AND WESTWARDS WHILE THEY WALKED AS SWIFTLY AS THE HOBBITS COULD GO THEY TALKED IN HUSHED VOICES
I BROKE OFF OUR SPEECH TOGETHER SAID FARAMIR NOT ONLY BECAUSE TIME PRESSED AS MASTER SAMWISE HAD REMINDED ME BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE WERE DRAWING NEAR TO MATTERS THAT WERE BETTER NOT DEBATED OPENLY BEFORE MANY MEN IT WAS FOR THAT REASON THAT I TURNED RATHER TO THE MATTER OF MY BROTHER AND LET BE ISILDURS BANE YOU WERE NOT WHOLLY FRANK WITH ME FRODO
I TOLD NO LIES AND OF THE TRUTH ALL I COULD SAID FRODO
I DO NOT BLAME YOU SAID FARAMIR YOU SPOKE WITH SKILL IN A HARD PLACE AND WISELY IT SEEMED TO ME BUT I LEARNED OR GUESSED MORE FROM YOU THAN YOUR WORDS SAID YOU WERE NOT FRIENDLY WITH BOROMIR OR YOU DID NOT PART IN FRIENDSHIP YOU AND MASTER SAMWISE TOO I GUESS HAVE SOME GRIEVANCE NOW I LOVED HIM DEARLY AND WOULD GLADLY AVENGE HIS DEATH YET I KNEW HIM WELL ISILDURS BANE  I WOULD HAZARD THAT ISILDURS BANE LAY BETWEEN YOU AND WAS A CAUSE OF CONTENTION IN YOUR COMPANY CLEARLY IT IS A MIGHTY HEIRLOOM OF SOME SORT AND SUCH THINGS DO NOT BREED PEACE AMONG CONFEDERATES NOT IF AUGHT MAY BE LEARNED FROM ANCIENT TALES DO I NOT HIT NEAR THE MARK
NEAR SAID FRODO BUT NOT IN THE GOLD THERE WAS NO CONTENTION IN OUR COMPANY THOUGH THERE WAS DOUBT DOUBT WHICH WAY WE SHOULD TAKE FROM THE EMYN MUIL BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY ANCIENT TALES TEACH US ALSO THE PERIL OF RASH WORDS CONCERNING SUCH THINGS AS  HEIRLOOMS
AH THEN IT IS AS I THOUGHT YOUR TROUBLE WAS WITH BOROMIR ALONE HE WISHED THIS THING BROUGHT TO MINAS TIRITH ALAS IT IS A CROOKED FATE THAT SEALS YOUR LIPS WHO SAW HIM LAST AND HOLDS FROM ME THAT WHICH I LONG TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN HIS HEART AND THOUGHT IN HIS LATEST HOURS WHETHER HE ERRED OR NO OF THIS I AM SURE HE DIED WELL ACHIEVING SOME GOOD THING HIS FACE WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL EVEN THAN IN LIFE
BUT FRODO I PRESSED YOU HARD AT FIRST ABOUT ISILDURS BANE FORGIVE ME IT WAS UNWISE IN SUCH AN HOUR AND PLACE I HAD NOT HAD TIME FOR THOUGHT WE HAD HAD A HARD FIGHT AND THERE WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO FILL MY MIND BUT EVEN AS I SPOKE WITH YOU I DREW NEARER TO THE MARK AND SO DELIBERATELY SHOT WIDER FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT MUCH IS STILL PRESERVED OF ANCIENT LORE AMONG THE RULERS OF THE CITY THAT IS NOT SPREAD ABROAD WE OF MY HOUSE ARE NOT OF THE LINE OF ELENDIL THOUGH THE BLOOD OF NUMENOR IS IN US FOR WE RECKON BACK OUR LINE TO MARDIL THE GOOD STEWARD WHO RULED IN THE KINGS STEAD WHEN HE WENT AWAY TO WAR AND THAT WAS KING EARNUR LAST OF THE LINE OF ANARION AND CHILDLESS AND HE CAME NEVER BACK AND THE STEWARDS HAVE GOVERNED THE CITY SINCE THAT DAY THOUGH IT WAS MANY GENERATIONS OF MEN AGO
AND THIS I REMEMBER OF BOROMIR AS A BOY WHEN WE TOGETHER LEARNED THE TALE OF OUR SIRES AND THE HISTORY OF OUR CITY THAT ALWAYS IT DISPLEASED HIM THAT HIS FATHER WAS NOT KING HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS NEEDS IT TO MAKE A STEWARD A KING IF THE KING RETURNS NOT  HE ASKED FEW YEARS MAYBE IN OTHER PLACES OF LESS ROYALTY MY FATHER ANSWERED IN GONDOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS WOULD NOT SUFFICE ALAS POOR BOROMIR DOES THAT NOT TELL YOU SOMETHING OF HIM
IT DOES SAID FRODO YET ALWAYS HE TREATED ARAGORN WITH HONOUR
I DOUBT IT NOT SAID FARAMIR IF HE WERE SATISFIED OF ARAGORNS CLAIM AS YOU SAY HE WOULD GREATLY REVERENCE HIM BUT THE PINCH HAS NOT YET COME THEY HAD NOT YET REACHED MINAS TIRITH OR BECOME RIVALS IN HER WARS
BUT I STRAY WE IN THE HOUSE OF DENETHOR KNOW MUCH ANCIENT LORE BY LONG TRADITION AND THERE ARE MOREOVER IN OUR TREASURIES MANY THINGS PRESERVED BOOKS AND TABLETS WRIT ON WITHERED PARCHMENTS YEA AND ON STONE AND ON LEAVES OF SILVER AND OF GOLD IN DIVERS CHARACTERS SOME NONE CAN NOW READ AND FOR THE REST FEW EVER UNLOCK THEM I CAN READ A LITTLE IN THEM FOR I HAVE HAD TEACHING IT WAS THESE RECORDS THAT BROUGHT THE GREY PILGRIM TO US I FIRST SAW HIM WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND HE HAS BEEN TWICE OR THRICE SINCE THEN
THE GREY PILGRIM SAID FRODO HAD HE A NAME
MITHRANDIR WE CALLED HIM IN ELFFASHION SAID FARAMIR AND HE WAS CONTENT MANY ARE MY NAMES IN MANY COUNTRIES HE SAID MITHRANDIR AMONG THE ELVES THARKUN TO THE DWARVES OLORIN I WAS IN MY YOUTH IN THE WEST THAT IS FORGOTTEN IN THE SOUTH INCANUS IN THE NORTH GANDALF TO THE EAST I GO NOT 
GANDALF SAID FRODO I THOUGHT IT WAS HE GANDALF THE GREY DEAREST OF COUNSELLORS LEADER OF OUR COMPANY HE WAS LOST IN MORIA
MITHRANDIR WAS LOST SAID FARAMIR AN EVIL FATE SEEMS TO HAVE PURSUED YOUR FELLOWSHIP IT IS HARD INDEED TO BELIEVE THAT ONE OF SO GREAT WISDOM AND OF POWER  FOR MANY WONDERFUL THINGS HE DID AMONG US  COULD PERISH AND SO MUCH LORE BE TAKEN FROM THE WORLD ARE YOU SURE OF THIS AND THAT HE DID NOT JUST LEAVE YOU AND DEPART WHERE HE WOULD
ALAS YES SAID FRODO I SAW HIM FALL INTO THE ABYSS
I SEE THAT THERE IS SOME GREAT TALE OF DREAD IN THIS SAID FARAMIR WHICH PERHAPS YOU MAY TELL ME IN THE EVENINGTIME THIS MITHRANDIR WAS I NOW GUESS MORE THAN A LOREMASTER A GREAT MOVER OF THE DEEDS THAT ARE DONE IN OUR TIME HAD HE BEEN AMONG US TO CONSULT CONCERNING THE HARD WORDS OF OUR DREAM HE COULD HAVE MADE THEM CLEAR TO US WITHOUT NEED OF MESSENGER YET MAYBE HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO AND THE JOURNEY OF BOROMIR WAS DOOMED MITHRANDIR NEVER SPOKE TO US OF WHAT WAS TO BE NOR DID HE REVEAL HIS PURPOSES HE GOT LEAVE OF DENETHOR HOW I DO NOT KNOW TO LOOK AT THE SECRETS OF OUR TREASURY AND I LEARNED A LITTLE OF HIM WHEN HE WOULD TEACH AND THAT WAS SELDOM EVER HE WOULD SEARCH AND WOULD QUESTION US ABOVE ALL ELSE CONCERNING THE GREAT BATTLE THAT WAS FOUGHT UPON DAGORLAD IN THE BEGINNING OF GONDOR WHEN HE WHOM WE DO NOT NAME WAS OVERTHROWN AND HE WAS EAGER FOR STORIES OF ISILDUR THOUGH OF HIM WE HAD LESS TO TELL FOR NOTHING CERTAIN WAS EVER KNOWN AMONG US OF HIS END
NOW FARAMIRS VOICE SANK TO A WHISPER BUT THIS MUCH I LEARNED OR GUESSED AND I HAVE KEPT IT EVER SECRET IN MY HEART SINCE THAT ISILDUR TOOK SOMEWHAT FROM THE HAND OF THE UNNAMED ERE HE WENT AWAY FROM GONDOR NEVER TO BE SEEN AMONG MORTAL MEN AGAIN HERE I THOUGHT WAS THE ANSWER TO MITHRANDIRS QUESTIONING BUT IT SEEMED THEN A MATTER THAT CONCERNED ONLY THE SEEKERS AFTER ANCIENT LEARNING NOR WHEN THE RIDDLING WORDS OF OUR DREAM WERE DEBATED AMONG US DID I THINK OF ISILDURS BANE AS BEING THIS SAME THING FOR ISILDUR WAS AMBUSHED AND SLAIN BY ORCARROWS ACCORDING TO THE ONLY LEGEND THAT WE KNEW AND MITHRANDIR HAD NEVER TOLD ME MORE
WHAT IN TRUTH THIS THING IS I CANNOT YET GUESS BUT SOME HEIRLOOM OF POWER AND PERIL IT MUST BE A FELL WEAPON PERCHANCE DEVISED BY THE DARK LORD IF IT WERE A THING THAT GAVE ADVANTAGE IN BATTLE I CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT BOROMIR THE PROUD AND FEARLESS OFTEN RASH EVER ANXIOUS FOR THE VICTORY OF MINAS TIRITH AND HIS OWN GLORY THEREIN MIGHT DESIRE SUCH A THING AND BE ALLURED BY IT ALAS THAT EVER HE WENT ON THAT ERRAND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY MY FATHER AND THE ELDERS BUT HE PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS BEING THE OLDER AND THE HARDIER BOTH TRUE AND HE WOULD NOT BE STAYED
BUT FEAR NO MORE I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS THING IF IT LAY BY THE HIGHWAY NOT WERE MINAS TIRITH FALLING IN RUIN AND I ALONE COULD SAVE HER SO USING THE WEAPON OF THE DARK LORD FOR HER GOOD AND MY GLORY NO I DO NOT WISH FOR SUCH TRIUMPHS FRODO SON OF DROGO
NEITHER DID THE COUNCIL SAID FRODO NOR DO I I WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SUCH MATTERS
FOR MYSELF SAID FARAMIR I WOULD SEE THE WHITE TREE IN FLOWER AGAIN IN THE COURTS OF THE KINGS AND THE SILVER CROWN RETURN AND MINAS TIRITH IN PEACE MINAS ANOR AGAIN AS OF OLD FULL OF LIGHT HIGH AND FAIR BEAUTIFUL AS A QUEEN AMONG OTHER QUEENS NOT A MISTRESS OF MANY SLAVES NAY NOT EVEN A KIND MISTRESS OF WILLING SLAVES WAR MUST BE WHILE WE DEFEND OUR LIVES AGAINST A DESTROYER WHO WOULD DEVOUR ALL BUT I DO NOT LOVE THE BRIGHT SWORD FOR ITS SHARPNESS NOR THE ARROW FOR ITS SWIFTNESS NOR THE WARRIOR FOR HIS GLORY I LOVE ONLY THAT WHICH THEY DEFEND THE CITY OF THE MEN OF NUMENOR AND I WOULD HAVE HER LOVED FOR HER MEMORY HER ANCIENTRY HER BEAUTY AND HER PRESENT WISDOM NOT FEARED SAVE AS MEN MAY FEAR THE DIGNITY OF A MAN OLD AND WISE
SO FEAR ME NOT I DO NOT ASK YOU TO TELL ME MORE I DO NOT EVEN ASK YOU TO TELL ME WHETHER I NOW SPEAK NEARER THE MARK BUT IF YOU WILL TRUST ME IT MAY BE THAT I CAN ADVISE YOU IN YOUR PRESENT QUEST WHATEVER THAT BE  YES AND EVEN AID YOU
FRODO MADE NO ANSWER ALMOST HE YIELDED TO THE DESIRE FOR HELP AND COUNSEL TO TELL THIS GRAVE YOUNG MAN WHOSE WORDS SEEMED SO WISE AND FAIR ALL THAT WAS IN HIS MIND BUT SOMETHING HELD HIM BACK HIS HEART WAS HEAVY WITH FEAR AND SORROW IF HE AND SAM WERE INDEED AS SEEMED LIKELY ALL THAT WAS NOW LEFT OF THE NINE WALKERS THEN HE WAS IN SOLE COMMAND OF THE SECRET OF THEIR ERRAND BETTER MISTRUST UNDESERVED THAN RASH WORDS AND THE MEMORY OF BOROMIR OF THE DREADFUL CHANGE THAT THE LURE OF THE RING HAD WORKED IN HIM WAS VERY PRESENT TO HIS MIND WHEN HE LOOKED AT FARAMIR AND LISTENED TO HIS VOICE UNLIKE THEY WERE AND YET ALSO MUCH AKIN
THEY WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE PASSING LIKE GREY AND GREEN SHADOWS UNDER THE OLD TREES THEIR FEET MAKING NO SOUND ABOVE THEM MANY BIRDS SANG AND THE SUN GLISTENED ON THE POLISHED ROOF OF DARK LEAVES IN THE EVERGREEN WOODS OF ITHILIEN
SAM HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE CONVERSATION THOUGH HE HAD LISTENED AND AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD ATTENDED WITH HIS KEEN HOBBIT EARS TO ALL THE SOFT WOODLAND NOISES ABOUT THEM ONE THING HE HAD NOTED THAT IN ALL THE TALK THE NAME OF GOLLUM HAD NOT ONCE COME UP HE WAS GLAD THOUGH HE FELT THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD NEVER HEAR IT AGAIN HE SOON BECAME AWARE ALSO THAT THOUGH THEY WALKED ALONE THERE WERE MANY MEN CLOSE AT HAND NOT ONLY DAMROD AND MABLUNG FLITTING IN AND OUT OF THE SHADOWS AHEAD BUT OTHERS ON EITHER SIDE ALL MAKING THEIR SWIFT SECRET WAY TO SOME APPOINTED PLACE
ONCE LOOKING SUDDENLY BACK AS IF SOME PRICKLE OF THE SKIN TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS WATCHED FROM BEHIND HE THOUGHT HE CAUGHT A BRIEF GLIMPSE OF A SMALL DARK SHAPE SLIPPING BEHIND A TREETRUNK HE OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK AND SHUT IT AGAIN IM NOT SURE OF IT HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND WHY SHOULD I REMIND THEM OF THE OLD VILLAIN IF THEY CHOOSE TO FORGET HIM I WISH I COULD
SO THEY PASSED ON UNTIL THE WOODLANDS GREW THINNER AND THE LAND BEGAN TO FALL MORE STEEPLY THEN THEY TURNED ASIDE AGAIN TO THE RIGHT AND CAME QUICKLY TO A SMALL RIVER IN A NARROW GORGE IT WAS THE SAME STREAM THAT TRICKLED FAR ABOVE OUT OF THE ROUND POOL NOW GROWN TO A SWIFT TORRENT LEAPING DOWN OVER MANY STONES IN A DEEPCLOVEN BED OVERHUNG WITH ILEX AND DARK BOXWOODS LOOKING WEST THEY COULD SEE BELOW THEM IN A HAZE OF LIGHT LOWLANDS AND BROAD MEADS AND GLINTING FAR OFF IN THE WESTERING SUN THE WIDE WATERS OF THE ANDUIN
HERE ALAS I MUST DO YOU A DISCOURTESY SAID FARAMIR I HOPE YOU WILL PARDON IT TO ONE WHO HAS SO FAR MADE HIS ORDERS GIVE WAY TO COURTESY AS NOT TO SLAY YOU OR TO BIND YOU BUT IT IS A COMMAND THAT NO STRANGER NOT EVEN ONE OF ROHAN THAT FIGHTS WITH US SHALL SEE THE PATH WE NOW GO WITH OPEN EYES I MUST BLINDFOLD YOU
AS YOU WILL SAID FRODO EVEN THE ELVES DO LIKEWISE AT NEED AND BLINDFOLDED WE CROSSED THE BORDERS OF FAIR LOTHLORIEN GIMLI THE DWARF TOOK IT ILL BUT THE HOBBITS ENDURED IT
IT IS TO NO PLACE SO FAIR THAT I SHALL LEAD YOU SAID FARAMIR BUT I AM GLAD THAT YOU WILL TAKE THIS WILLINGLY AND NOT BY FORCE
HE CALLED SOFTLY AND IMMEDIATELY MABLUNG AND DAMROD STEPPED OUT OF THE TREES AND CAME BACK TO HIM BLINDFOLD THESE GUESTS SAID FARAMIR SECURELY BUT NOT SO AS TO DISCOMFORT THEM DO NOT TIE THEIR HANDS THEY WILL GIVE THEIR WORD NOT TO TRY AND SEE I COULD TRUST THEM TO SHUT THEIR EYES OF THEIR OWN ACCORD BUT EYES WILL BLINK IF THE FEET STUMBLE LEAD THEM SO THAT THEY DO NOT FALTER
WITH GREEN SCARVES THE TWO GUARDS NOW BOUND UP THE HOBBITS EYES AND DREW THEIR HOODS DOWN ALMOST TO THEIR MOUTHS THEN QUICKLY THEY TOOK EACH ONE BY THE HAND AND WENT ON THEIR WAY ALL THAT FRODO AND SAM KNEW OF THIS LAST MILE OF THE ROAD THEY LEARNED FROM GUESSING IN THE DARK AFTER A LITTLE THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE ON A PATH DESCENDING STEEPLY SOON IT GREW SO NARROW THAT THEY WENT IN SINGLE FILE BRUSHING A STONY WALL ON EITHER SIDE THEIR GUARDS STEERED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH HANDS LAID FIRMLY ON THEIR SHOULDERS NOW AND AGAIN THEY CAME TO ROUGH PLACES AND WERE LIFTED FROM THEIR FEET FOR A WHILE AND THEN SET DOWN AGAIN ALWAYS THE NOISE OF THE RUNNING WATER WAS ON THEIR RIGHT HAND AND IT GREW NEARER AND LOUDER AT LENGTH THEY WERE HALTED QUICKLY MABLUNG AND DAMROD TURNED THEM ABOUT SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY LOST ALL SENSE OF DIRECTION THEY CLIMBED UPWARDS A LITTLE IT SEEMED COLD AND THE NOISE OF THE STREAM HAD BECOME FAINT THEN THEY WERE PICKED UP AND CARRIED DOWN DOWN MANY STEPS AND ROUND A CORNER SUDDENLY THEY HEARD THE WATER AGAIN LOUD NOW RUSHING AND SPLASHING ALL ROUND THEM IT SEEMED AND THEY FELT A FINE RAIN ON THEIR HANDS AND CHEEKS AT LAST THEY WERE SET ON THEIR FEET ONCE MORE FOR A MOMENT THEY STOOD SO HALF FEARFUL BLINDFOLD NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY WERE AND NO ONE SPOKE
THEN CAME THE VOICE OF FARAMIR CLOSE BEHIND LET THEM SEE HE SAID THE SCARVES WERE REMOVED AND THEIR HOODS DRAWN BACK AND THEY BLINKED AND GASPED
THEY STOOD ON A WET FLOOR OF POLISHED STONE THE DOORSTEP AS IT WERE OF A ROUGHHEWN GATE OF ROCK OPENING DARK BEHIND THEM BUT IN FRONT A THIN VEIL OF WATER WAS HUNG SO NEAR THAT FRODO COULD HAVE PUT AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM INTO IT IT FACED WESTWARD THE LEVEL SHAFTS OF THE SETTING SUN BEHIND BEAT UPON IT AND THE RED LIGHT WAS BROKEN INTO MANY FLICKERING BEAMS OF EVERCHANGING COLOUR IT WAS AS IF THEY STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF SOME ELVENTOWER CURTAINED WITH THREADED JEWELS OF SILVER AND GOLD AND RUBY SAPPHIRE AND AMETHYST ALL KINDLED WITH AN UNCONSUMING FIRE
AT LEAST BY GOOD CHANCE WE CAME AT THE RIGHT HOUR TO REWARD YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE SAID FARAMIR THIS IS THE WINDOW OF THE SUNSET HENNETH ANNUN FAIREST OF ALL THE FALLS OF ITHILIEN LAND OF MANY FOUNTAINS FEW STRANGERS HAVE EVER SEEN IT BUT THERE IS NO KINGLY HALL BEHIND TO MATCH IT ENTER NOW AND SEE
EVEN AS HE SPOKE THE SUN SANK AND THE FIRE FADED IN THE FLOWING WATER THEY TURNED AND PASSED UNDER THE LOW FORBIDDING ARCH AT ONCE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A ROCKCHAMBER WIDE AND ROUGH WITH AN UNEVEN STOOPING ROOF A FEW TORCHES WERE KINDLED AND CAST A DIM LIGHT ON THE GLISTENING WALLS MANY MEN WERE ALREADY THERE OTHERS WERE STILL COMING IN BY TWOS AND THREES THROUGH A DARK NARROW DOOR ON ONE SIDE AS THEIR EYES GREW ACCUSTOMED TO THE GLOOM THE HOBBITS SAW THAT THE CAVE WAS LARGER THAN THEY HAD GUESSED AND WAS FILLED WITH GREAT STORE OF ARMS AND VICTUALS
WELL HERE IS OUR REFUGE SAID FARAMIR NOT A PLACE OF GREAT EASE BUT HERE YOU MAY PASS THE NIGHT IN PEACE IT IS DRY AT LEAST AND THERE IS FOOD THOUGH NO FIRE AT ONE TIME THE WATER FLOWED DOWN THROUGH THIS CAVE AND OUT OF THE ARCH BUT ITS COURSE WAS CHANGED FURTHER UP THE GORGE BY WORKMEN OF OLD AND THE STREAM SENT DOWN IN A FALL OF DOUBLED HEIGHT OVER THE ROCKS FAR ABOVE ALL THE WAYS INTO THIS GROT WERE THEN SEALED AGAINST THE ENTRY OF WATER OR AUGHT ELSE ALL SAVE ONE THERE ARE NOW BUT TWO WAYS OUT THAT PASSAGE YONDER BY WHICH YOU ENTERED BLINDFOLD AND THROUGH THE WINDOWCURTAIN INTO A DEEP BOWL FILLED WITH KNIVES OF STONE NOW REST A WHILE UNTIL THE EVENING MEAL IS SET
THE HOBBITS WERE TAKEN TO A CORNER AND GIVEN A LOW BED TO LIE ON IF THEY WISHED MEANWHILE MEN BUSIED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE CAVE QUIETLY AND IN ORDERLY QUICKNESS LIGHT TABLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE WALLS AND SET UP ON TRESTLES AND LADEN WITH GEAR THIS WAS PLAIN AND UNADORNED FOR THE MOST PART BUT ALL WELL AND FAIRLY MADE ROUND PLATTERS BOWLS AND DISHES OF GLAZED BROWN CLAY OR TURNED BOXWOOD SMOOTH AND CLEAN HERE AND THERE WAS A CUP OR BASIN OF POLISHED BRONZE AND A GOBLET OF PLAIN SILVER WAS SET BY THE CAPTAINS SEAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INMOST TABLE
FARAMIR WENT ABOUT AMONG THE MEN QUESTIONING EACH AS HE CAME IN IN A SOFT VOICE SOME CAME BACK FROM THE PURSUIT OF THE SOUTHRONS OTHERS LEFT BEHIND AS SCOUTS NEAR THE ROAD CAME IN LATEST ALL THE SOUTHRONS HAD BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR SAVE ONLY THE GREAT MUMAK WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM NONE COULD SAY OF THE ENEMY NO MOVEMENT COULD BE SEEN NOT EVEN AN ORCSPY WAS ABROAD
YOU SAW AND HEARD NOTHING ANBORN FARAMIR ASKED OF THE LATEST COMER
WELL NO LORD SAID THE MAN NO ORC AT LEAST BUT I SAW OR THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING A LITTLE STRANGE IT WAS GETTING DEEP DUSK WHEN THE EYES MAKE THINGS GREATER THAN THEY SHOULD BE SO PERHAPS IT MAY HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN A SQUIRREL SAM PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT THIS YET IF SO IT WAS A BLACK SQUIRREL AND I SAW NO TAIL TWAS LIKE A SHADOW ON THE GROUND AND IT WHISKED BEHIND A TREETRUNK WHEN I DREW NIGH AND WENT UP ALOFT AS SWIFT AS ANY SQUIRREL COULD YOU WILL NOT HAVE US SLAY WILD BEASTS FOR NO PURPOSE AND IT SEEMED NO MORE SO I TRIED NO ARROW IT WAS TOO DARK FOR SURE SHOOTING ANYWAY AND THE CREATURE WAS GONE INTO THE GLOOM OF THE LEAVES IN A TWINKLING BUT I STAYED FOR A WHILE FOR IT SEEMED STRANGE AND THEN I HASTENED BACK I THOUGHT I HEARD THE THING HISS AT ME FROM HIGH ABOVE AS I TURNED AWAY A LARGE SQUIRREL MAYBE PERHAPS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE UNNAMED SOME OF THE BEASTS OF MIRKWOOD ARE WANDERING HITHER TO OUR WOODS THEY HAVE BLACK SQUIRRELS THERE TIS SAID
PERHAPS SAID FARAMIR BUT THAT WOULD BE AN ILL OMEN IF IT WERE SO WE DO NOT WANT THE ESCAPES OF MIRKWOOD IN ITHILIEN SAM FANCIED THAT HE GAVE A SWIFT GLANCE TOWARDS THE HOBBITS AS HE SPOKE BUT SAM SAID NOTHING FOR A WHILE HE AND FRODO LAY BACK AND WATCHED THE TORCHLIGHT AND THE MEN MOVING TO AND FRO SPEAKING IN HUSHED VOICES THEN SUDDENLY FRODO FELL ASLEEP
SAM STRUGGLED WITH HIMSELF ARGUING THIS WAY AND THAT HE MAY BE ALL RIGHT HE THOUGHT AND THEN HE MAY NOT FAIR SPEECH MAY HIDE A FOUL HEART HE YAWNED I COULD SLEEP FOR A WEEK AND ID BE BETTER FOR IT AND WHAT CAN I DO IF I DO KEEP AWAKE ME ALL ALONE AND ALL THESE GREAT MEN ABOUT NOTHING SAM GAMGEE BUT YOUVE GOT TO KEEP AWAKE ALL THE SAME AND SOMEHOW HE MANAGED IT THE LIGHT FADED FROM THE CAVE DOOR AND THE GREY VEIL OF FALLING WATER GREW DIM AND WAS LOST IN GATHERING SHADOW ALWAYS THE SOUND OF THE WATER WENT ON NEVER CHANGING ITS NOTE MORNING OR EVENING OR NIGHT IT MURMURED AND WHISPERED OF SLEEP SAM STUCK HIS KNUCKLES IN HIS EYES
NOW MORE TORCHES WERE BEING LIT A CASK OF WINE WAS BROACHED STORAGE BARRELS WERE BEING OPENED MEN WERE FETCHING WATER FROM THE FALL SOME WERE LAVING THEIR HANDS IN BASINS A WIDE COPPER BOWL AND A WHITE CLOTH WERE BROUGHT TO FARAMIR AND HE WASHED
WAKE OUR GUESTS HE SAID AND TAKE THEM WATER IT IS TIME TO EAT
FRODO SAT UP AND YAWNED AND STRETCHED SAM NOT USED TO BEING WAITED ON LOOKED WITH SOME SURPRISE AT THE TALL MAN WHO BOWED HOLDING A BASIN OF WATER BEFORE HIM
PUT IT ON THE GROUND MASTER IF YOU PLEASE HE SAID EASIER FOR ME AND YOU THEN TO THE ASTONISHMENT AND AMUSEMENT OF THE MEN HE PLUNGED HIS HEAD INTO THE COLD WATER AND SPLASHED HIS NECK AND EARS
IS IT THE CUSTOM IN YOUR LAND TO WASH THE HEAD BEFORE SUPPER SAID THE MAN WHO WAITED ON THE HOBBITS
NO BEFORE BREAKFAST SAID SAM BUT IF YOURE SHORT OF SLEEP COLD WATER ON THE NECKS LIKE RAIN ON A WILTED LETTUCE THERE NOW I CAN KEEP AWAKE LONG ENOUGH TO EAT A BIT
THEY WERE LED THEN TO SEATS BESIDE FARAMIR BARRELS COVERED WITH PELTS AND HIGH ENOUGH ABOVE THE BENCHES OF THE MEN FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE BEFORE THEY ATE FARAMIR AND ALL HIS MEN TURNED AND FACED WEST IN A MOMENT OF SILENCE FARAMIR SIGNED TO FRODO AND SAM THAT THEY SHOULD DO LIKEWISE
SO WE ALWAYS DO HE SAID AS THEY SAT DOWN WE LOOK TOWARDS NUMENOR THAT WAS AND BEYOND TO ELVENHOME THAT IS AND TO THAT WHICH IS BEYOND ELVENHOME AND WILL EVER BE HAVE YOU NO SUCH CUSTOM AT MEAT
NO SAID FRODO FEELING STRANGELY RUSTIC AND UNTUTORED BUT IF WE ARE GUESTS WE BOW TO OUR HOST AND AFTER WE HAVE EATEN WE RISE AND THANK HIM
THAT WE DO ALSO SAID FARAMIR
AFTER SO LONG JOURNEYING AND CAMPING AND DAYS SPENT IN THE LONELY WILD THE EVENING MEAL SEEMED A FEAST TO THE HOBBITS TO DRINK PALE YELLOW WINE COOL AND FRAGRANT AND EAT BREAD AND BUTTER AND SALTED MEATS AND DRIED FRUITS AND GOOD RED CHEESE WITH CLEAN HANDS AND CLEAN KNIVES AND PLATES NEITHER FRODO NOR SAM REFUSED ANYTHING THAT WAS OFFERED NOR A SECOND NOR INDEED A THIRD HELPING THE WINE COURSED IN THEIR VEINS AND TIRED LIMBS AND THEY FELT GLAD AND EASY OF HEART AS THEY HAD NOT DONE SINCE THEY LEFT THE LAND OF LORIEN
WHEN ALL WAS DONE FARAMIR LED THEM TO A RECESS AT THE BACK OF THE CAVE PARTLY SCREENED BY CURTAINS AND A CHAIR AND TWO STOOLS WERE BROUGHT THERE A LITTLE EARTHENWARE LAMP BURNED IN A NICHE
YOU MAY SOON DESIRE TO SLEEP HE SAID AND ESPECIALLY GOOD SAMWISE WHO WOULD NOT CLOSE HIS EYES BEFORE HE ATE  WHETHER FOR FEAR OF BLUNTING THE EDGE OF A NOBLE HUNGER OR FOR FEAR OF ME I DO NOT KNOW BUT IT IS NOT GOOD TO SLEEP TOO SOON AFTER MEAT AND THAT FOLLOWING A FAST LET US TALK A WHILE ON YOUR JOURNEY FROM RIVENDELL THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY THINGS TO TELL AND YOU TOO WOULD PERHAPS WISH TO LEARN SOMETHING OF US AND THE LANDS WHERE YOU NOW ARE TELL ME OF BOROMIR MY BROTHER AND OF OLD MITHRANDIR AND OF THE FAIR PEOPLE OF LOTHLORIEN
FRODO NO LONGER FELT SLEEPY AND HE WAS WILLING TO TALK BUT THOUGH THE FOOD AND WINE HAD PUT HIM AT HIS EASE HE HAD NOT LOST ALL HIS CAUTION SAM WAS BEAMING AND HUMMING TO HIMSELF BUT WHEN FRODO SPOKE HE WAS AT FIRST CONTENT TO LISTEN ONLY OCCASIONALLY VENTURING TO MAKE AN EXCLAMATION OF AGREEMENT
FRODO TOLD MANY TALES YET ALWAYS HE STEERED THE MATTER AWAY FROM THE QUEST OF THE COMPANY AND FROM THE RING ENLARGING RATHER ON THE VALIANT PART BOROMIR HAD PLAYED IN ALL THEIR ADVENTURES WITH THE WOLVES OF THE WILD IN THE SNOWS UNDER CARADHRAS AND IN THE MINES OF MORIA WHERE GANDALF FELL FARAMIR WAS MOST MOVED BY THE STORY OF THE FIGHT ON THE BRIDGE
IT MUST HAVE IRKED BOROMIR TO RUN FROM ORCS HE SAID OR EVEN FROM THE FELL THING YOU NAME THE BALROG  EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THE LAST TO LEAVE
HE WAS THE LAST SAID FRODO BUT ARAGORN WAS FORCED TO LEAD US HE ALONE KNEW THE WAY AFTER GANDALFS FALL BUT HAD THERE NOT BEEN US LESSER FOLK TO CARE FOR I DO NOT THINK THAT EITHER HE OR BOROMIR WOULD HAVE FLED
MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HAD BOROMIR FALLEN THERE WITH MITHRANDIR SAID FARAMIR AND NOT GONE ON TO THE FATE THAT WAITED ABOVE THE FALLS OF RAUROS
MAYBE BUT TELL ME NOW OF YOUR OWN FORTUNES SAID FRODO TURNING THE MATTER ASIDE ONCE AGAIN FOR I WOULD LEARN MORE OF MINAS ITHIL AND OSGILIATH AND MINAS TIRITH THE LONGENDURING WHAT HOPE HAVE YOU FOR THAT CITY IN YOUR LONG WAR
WHAT HOPE HAVE WE SAID FARAMIR IT IS LONG SINCE WE HAD ANY HOPE THE SWORD OF ELENDIL IF IT RETURNS INDEED MAY REKINDLE IT BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT IT WILL DO MORE THAN PUT OFF THE EVIL DAY UNLESS OTHER HELP UNLOOKEDFOR ALSO COMES FROM ELVES OR MEN FOR THE ENEMY INCREASES AND WE DECREASE WE ARE A FAILING PEOPLE A SPRINGLESS AUTUMN
THE MEN OF NUMENOR WERE SETTLED FAR AND WIDE ON THE SHORES AND SEAWARD REGIONS OF THE GREAT LANDS BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY FELL INTO EVILS AND FOLLIES MANY BECAME ENAMOURED OF THE DARKNESS AND THE BLACK ARTS SOME WERE GIVEN OVER WHOLLY TO IDLENESS AND EASE AND SOME FOUGHT AMONG THEMSELVES UNTIL THEY WERE CONQUERED IN THEIR WEAKNESS BY THE WILD MEN
IT IS NOT SAID THAT EVIL ARTS WERE EVER PRACTISED IN GONDOR OR THAT THE NAMELESS ONE WAS EVER NAMED IN HONOUR THERE AND THE OLD WISDOM AND BEAUTY BROUGHT OUT OF THE WEST REMAINED LONG IN THE REALM OF THE SONS OF ELENDIL THE FAIR AND THEY LINGER THERE STILL YET EVEN SO IT WAS GONDOR THAT BROUGHT ABOUT ITS OWN DECAY FALLING BY DEGREES INTO DOTAGE AND THINKING THAT THE ENEMY WAS ASLEEP WHO WAS ONLY BANISHED NOT DESTROYED
DEATH WAS EVER PRESENT BECAUSE THE NUMENOREANS STILL AS THEY HAD IN THEIR OLD KINGDOM AND SO LOST IT HUNGERED AFTER ENDLESS LIFE UNCHANGING KINGS MADE TOMBS MORE SPLENDID THAN HOUSES OF THE LIVING AND COUNTED OLD NAMES IN THE ROLLS OF THEIR DESCENT DEARER THAN THE NAMES OF SONS CHILDLESS LORDS SAT IN AGED HALLS MUSING ON HERALDRY IN SECRET CHAMBERS WITHERED MEN COMPOUNDED STRONG ELIXIRS OR IN HIGH COLD TOWERS ASKED QUESTIONS OF THE STARS AND THE LAST KING OF THE LINE OF ANARION HAD NO HEIR
BUT THE STEWARDS WERE WISER AND MORE FORTUNATE WISER FOR THEY RECRUITED THE STRENGTH OF OUR PEOPLE FROM THE STURDY FOLK OF THE SEACOAST AND FROM THE HARDY MOUNTAINEERS OF ERED NIMRAIS AND THEY MADE A TRUCE WITH THE PROUD PEOPLES OF THE NORTH WHO OFTEN HAD ASSAILED US MEN OF FIERCE VALOUR BUT OUR KIN FROM AFAR OFF UNLIKE THE WILD EASTERLINGS OR THE CRUEL HARADRIM
SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF CIRION THE TWELFTH STEWARD AND MY FATHER IS THE SIT AND TWENTIETH THAT THEY RODE TO OUR AID AND AT THE GREAT FIELD OF CELEBRANT THEY DESTROYED OUR ENEMIES THAT HAD SEIZED OUR NORTHERN PROVINCES THESE ARE THE ROHIRRIM AS WE NAME THEM MASTERS OF HORSES AND WE CEDED TO THEM THE FIELDS OF CALENARDHON THAT ARE SINCE CALLED ROHAN FOR THAT PROVINCE HAD LONG BEEN SPARSELY PEOPLED AND THEY BECAME OUR ALLIES AND HAVE EVER PROVED TRUE TO US AIDING US AT NEED AND GUARDING OUR NORTHERN MARCHES AND THE GAP OF ROHAN
OF OUR LORE AND MANNERS THEY HAVE LEARNED WHAT THEY WOULD AND THEIR LORDS SPEAK OUR SPEECH AT NEED YET FOR THE MOST PART THEY HOLD BY THE WAYS OF THEIR OWN FATHERS AND TO THEIR OWN MEMORIES AND THEY SPEAK AMONG THEMSELVES THEIR OWN NORTH TONGUE AND WE LOVE THEM TALL MEN AND FAIR WOMEN VALIANT BOTH ALIKE GOLDENHAIRED BRIGHTEYED AND STRONG THEY REMIND US OF THE YOUTH OF MEN AS THEY WERE IN THE ELDER DAYS INDEED IT IS SAID BY OUR LOREMASTERS THAT THEY HAVE FROM OF OLD THIS AFFINITY WITH US THAT THEY ARE COME FROM THOSE SAME THREE HOUSES OF MEN AS WERE THE NUMENOREANS IN THEIR BEGINNING NOT FROM HADOR THE GOLDENHAIRED THE ELFFRIEND MAYBE YET FROM SUCH OF HIS SONS AND PEOPLE AS WENT NOT OVER SEA INTO THE WEST REFUSING THE CALL
FOR SO WE RECKON MEN IN OUR LORE CALLING THEM THE HIGH OR MEN OF THE WEST WHICH WERE NUMENOREANS AND THE MIDDLE PEOPLES MEN OF THE TWILIGHT SUCH AS ARE THE ROHIRRIM AND THEIR KIN THAT DWELL STILL FAR IN THE NORTH AND THE WILD THE MEN OF DARKNESS
YET NOW IF THE ROHIRRIM ARE GROWN IN SOME WAYS MORE LIKE TO US ENHANCED IN ARTS AND GENTLENESS WE TOO HAVE BECOME MORE LIKE TO THEM AND CAN SCARCE CLAIM ANY LONGER THE TITLE HIGH WE ARE BECOME MIDDLE MEN OF THE TWILIGHT BUT WITH MEMORY OF OTHER THINGS FOR AS THE ROHIRRIM DO WE NOW LOVE WAR AND VALOUR AS THINGS GOOD IN THEMSELVES BOTH A SPORT AND AN END AND THOUGH WE STILL HOLD THAT A WARRIOR SHOULD HAVE MORE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAN ONLY THE CRAFT OF WEAPONS AND SLAYING WE ESTEEM A WARRIOR NONETHELESS ABOVE MEN OF OTHER CRAFTS SUCH IS THE NEED OF OUR DAYS SO EVEN WAS MY BROTHER BOROMIR A MAN OF PROWESS AND FOR THAT HE WAS ACCOUNTED THE BEST MAN IN GONDOR AND VERY VALIANT INDEED HE WAS NO HEIR OF MINAS TIRITH HAS FOR LONG YEARS BEEN SO HARDY IN TOIL SO ONWARD INTO BATTLE OR BLOWN A MIGHTIER NOTE ON THE GREAT HORN FARAMIR SIGHED AND FELL SILENT FOR A WHILE
YOU DONT SAY MUCH IN ALL YOUR TALES ABOUT THE ELVES SIR SAID SAM SUDDENLY PLUCKING UP COURAGE HE HAD NOTED THAT FARAMIR SEEMED TO REFER TO ELVES WITH REVERENCE AND THIS EVEN MORE THAN HIS COURTESY AND HIS FOOD AND WINE HAD WON SAMS RESPECT AND QUIETED HIS SUSPICIONS
NO INDEED MASTER SAMWISE SAID FARAMIR FOR I AM NOT LEARNED IN ELVENLORE BUT THERE YOU TOUCH UPON ANOTHER POINT IN WHICH WE HAVE CHANGED DECLINING FROM NUMENOR TO MIDDLEEARTH FOR AS YOU MAY KNOW IF MITHRANDIR WAS YOUR COMPANION AND YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH ELROND THE EDAIN THE FATHERS OF THE NUMENOREANS FOUGHT BESIDE THE ELVES IN THE FIRST WARS AND WERE REWARDED BY THE GIFT OF THE KINGDOM IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA WITHIN SIGHT OF ELVENHOME BUT IN MIDDLEEARTH MEN AND ELVES BECAME ESTRANGED IN THE DAYS OF DARKNESS BY THE ARTS OF THE ENEMY AND BY THE SLOW CHANGES OF TIME IN WHICH EACH KIND WALKED FURTHER DOWN THEIR SUNDERED ROADS MEN NOW FEAR AND MISDOUBT THE ELVES AND YET KNOW LITTLE OF THEM AND WE OF GONDOR GROW LIKE OTHER MEN LIKE THE MEN OF ROHAN FOR EVEN THEY WHO ARE THE FOES OF THE DARK LORD SHUN THE ELVES AND SPEAK OF THE GOLDEN WOOD WITH DREAD
YET THERE ARE AMONG US STILL SOME WHO HAVE DEALINGS WITH THE ELVES WHEN THEY MAY AND EVER AND ANON ONE WILL GO IN SECRET TO LORIEN SELDOM TO RETURN NOT I FOR I DEEM IT PERILOUS NOW FOR MORTAL MAN WILFULLY TO SEEK OUT THE ELDER PEOPLE YET I ENVY YOU THAT HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE WHITE LADY
THE LADY OF LORIEN GALADRIEL CRIED SAM YOU SHOULD SEE HER INDEED YOU SHOULD SIR I AM ONLY A HOBBIT AND GARDENINGS MY JOB AT HOME SIR IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME AND IM NOT MUCH GOOD AT POETRY  NOT AT MAKING IT A BIT OF A COMIC RHYME PERHAPS NOW AND AGAIN YOU KNOW BUT NOT REAL POETRY  SO I CANT TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN IT OUGHT TO BE SUNG YOUD HAVE TO GET STRIDER ARAGORN THAT IS OR OLD MR BILBO FOR THAT BUT I WISH I COULD MAKE A SONG ABOUT HER BEAUTIFUL SHE IS SIR LOVELY SOMETIMES LIKE A GREAT TREE IN FLOWER SOMETIMES LIKE A WHITE DAFFADOWNDILLY SMALL AND SLENDER LIKE HARD AS DIAMONDS SOFT AS MOONLIGHT WARM AS SUNLIGHT COLD AS FROST IN THE STARS PROUD AND FAROFF AS A SNOWMOUNTAIN AND AS MERRY AS ANY LASS I EVER SAW WITH DAISIES IN HER HAIR IN SPRINGTIME BUT THATS A LOT O NONSENSE AND ALL WIDE OF MY MARK
THEN SHE MUST BE LOVELY INDEED SAID FARAMIR PERILOUSLY FAIR
I DONT KNOW ABOUT PERILOUS SAID SAM IT STRIKES ME THAT FOLK TAKES THEIR PERIL WITH THEM INTO LORIEN AND FINDS IT THERE BECAUSE THEYVE BROUGHT IT BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD CALL HER PERILOUS BECAUSE SHES SO STRONG IN HERSELF YOU YOU COULD DASH YOURSELF TO PIECES ON HER LIKE A SHIP ON A ROCK OR DROWND YOURSELF LIKE A HOBBIT IN A RIVER BUT NEITHER ROCK NOR RIVER WOULD BE TO BLAME NOW BORO  HE STOPPED AND WENT RED IN THE FACE
YES NOW BOROMIR YOU WOULD SAY SAID FARAMIR WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HE TOOK HIS PERIL WITH HIM
YES SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON AND A FINE MAN AS YOUR BROTHER WAS IF I MAY SAY SO BUT YOUVE BEEN WARM ON THE SCENT ALL ALONG NOW I WATCHED BOROMIR AND LISTENED TO HIM FROM RIVENDELL ALL DOWN THE ROAD  LOOKING AFTER MY MASTER AS YOULL UNDERSTAND AND NOT MEANING ANY HARM TO BOROMIR  AND ITS MY OPINION THAT IN LORIEN HE FIRST SAW CLEARLY WHAT I GUESSED SOONER WHAT HE WANTED FROM THE MOMENT HE FIRST SAW IT HE WANTED THE ENEMYS RING
SAM CRIED FRODO AGHAST HE HAD FALLEN DEEP INTO HIS OWN THOUGHTS FOR A WHILE AND CAME OUT OF THEM SUDDENLY AND TOO LATE
SAVE ME SAID SAM TURNING WHITE AND THEN FLUSHING SCARLET THERE I GO AGAIN WHEN EVER YOU OPEN YOUR BIG MOUTH YOU PUT YOUR FOOT IN IT THE GAFFER USED TO SAY TO ME AND RIGHT ENOUGH O DEAR O DEAR
NOW LOOK HERE SIR HE TURNED FACING UP TO FARAMIR WITH ALL THE COURAGE THAT HE COULD MUSTER DONT YOU GO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MY MASTER BECAUSE HIS SERVANTS NO BETTER THAN A FOOL YOUVE SPOKEN VERY HANDSOME ALL ALONG PUT ME OFF MY GUARD TALKING OF ELVES AND ALL BUT HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES WE SAY NOWS A CHANCE TO SHOW YOUR QUALITY
SO IT SEEMS SAID FARAMIR SLOWLY AND VERY SOFTLY WITH A STRANGE SMILE SO THAT IS THE ANSWER TO ALL THE RIDDLES THE ONE RING THAT WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE PERISHED FROM THE WORLD AND BOROMIR TRIED TO TAKE IT BY FORCE AND YOU ESCAPED AND RAN ALL THE WAY  TO ME AND HERE IN THE WILD I HAVE YOU TWO HALFLINGS AND A HOST OF MEN AT MY CALL AND THE RING OF RINGS A PRETTY STROKE OF FORTUNE A CHANCE FOR FARAMIR CAPTAIN OF GONDOR TO SHOW HIS QUALITY HA HE STOOD UP VERY TALL AND STERN HIS GREY EYES GLINTING
FRODO AND SAM SPRANG FROM THEIR STOOLS AND SET THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE WALL FUMBLING FOR THEIR SWORDHILTS THERE WAS A SILENCE ALL THE MEN IN THE CAVE STOPPED TALKING AND LOOKED TOWARDS THEM IN WONDER BUT FARAMIR SAT DOWN AGAIN IN HIS CHAIR AND BEGAN TO LAUGH QUIETLY AND THEN SUDDENLY BECAME GRAVE AGAIN
ALAS FOR BOROMIR IT WAS TOO SORE A TRIAL HE SAID HOW YOU HAVE INCREASED MY SORROW YOU TWO STRANGE WANDERERS FROM A FAR COUNTRY BEARING THE PERIL OF MEN BUT YOU ARE LESS JUDGES OF MEN THAN I OF HALFLINGS WE ARE TRUTHSPEAKERS WE MEN OF GONDOR WE BOAST SELDOM AND THEN PERFORM OR DIE IN THE ATTEMPT NOT IF I FOUND IT ON THE HIGHWAY WOULD I TAKE IT I SAID EVEN IF I WERE SUCH A MAN AS TO DESIRE THIS THING AND EVEN THOUGH I KNEW NOT CLEARLY WHAT THIS THING WAS WHEN I SPOKE STILL I SHOULD TAKE THOSE WORDS AS A VOW AND BE HELD BY THEM
BUT I AM NOT SUCH A MAN OR I AM WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PERILS FROM WHICH A MAN MUST FLEE SIT AT PEACE AND BE COMFORTED SAMWISE IF YOU SEEM TO HAVE STUMBLED THINK THAT IT WAS FATED TO BE SO YOUR HEART IS SHREWD AS WELL AS FAITHFUL AND SAW CLEARER THAN YOUR EYES FOR STRANGE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM IT WAS SAFE TO DECLARE THIS TO ME IT MAY EVEN HELP THE MASTER THAT YOU LOVE IT SHALL TURN TO HIS GOOD IF IT IS IN MY POWER SO BE COMFORTED BUT DO NOT EVEN NAME THIS THING AGAIN ALOUD ONCE IS ENOUGH
THE HOBBITS CAME BACK TO THEIR SEATS AND SAT VERY QUIET MEN TURNED BACK TO THEIR DRINK AND THEIR TALK PERCEIVING THAT THEIR CAPTAIN HAD HAD SOME JEST OR OTHER WITH THE LITTLE GUESTS AND THAT IT WAS OVER
WELL FRODO NOW AT LAST WE UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER SAID FARAMIR IF YOU TOOK THIS THING ON YOURSELF UNWILLING AT OTHERS ASKING THEN YOU HAVE PITY AND HONOUR FROM ME AND I MARVEL AT YOU TO KEEP IT HID AND NOT TO USE IT YOU ARE A NEW PEOPLE AND A NEW WORLD TO ME ARE ALL YOUR KIN OF LIKE SORT YOUR LAND MUST BE A REALM OF PEACE AND CONTENT AND THERE MUST GARDENERS BE IN HIGH HONOUR
NOT ALL IS WELL THERE SAID FRODO BUT CERTAINLY GARDENERS ARE HONOURED
BUT FOLK MUST GROW WEARY THERE EVEN IN THEIR GARDENS AS DO ALL THINGS UNDER THE SUN OF THIS WORLD AND YOU ARE FAR FROM HOME AND WAYWORN NO MORE TONIGHT SLEEP BOTH OF YOU  IN PEACE IF YOU CAN FEAR NOT I DO NOT WISH TO SEE IT OR TOUCH IT OR KNOW MORE OF IT THAN I KNOW WHICH IS ENOUGH LEST PERIL PERCHANCE WAYLAY ME AND I FALL LOWER IN THE TEST THAN FRODO SON OF DROGO GO NOW TO REST  BUT FIRST TELL ME ONLY IF YOU WILL WHITHER YOU WISH TO GO AND WHAT TO DO FOR I MUST WATCH AND WAIT AND THINK TIME PASSES IN THE MORNING WE MUST EACH GO SWIFTLY ON THE WAYS APPOINTED TO US
FRODO HAD FELT HIMSELF TREMBLING AS THE FIRST SHOCK OF FEAR PASSED NOW A GREAT WEARINESS CAME DOWN ON HIM LIKE A CLOUD HE COULD DISSEMBLE AND RESIST NO LONGER
I WAS GOING TO FIND A WAY INTO MORDOR HE SAID FAINTLY I WAS GOING TO GORGOROTH I MUST FIND THE MOUNTAIN OF FIRE AND CAST THE THING INTO THE GULF OF DOOM GANDALF SAID SO I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER GET THERE
FARAMIR STARED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT IN GRAVE ASTONISHMENT THEN SUDDENLY HE CAUGHT HIM AS HE SWAYED AND LIFTING HIM GENTLY CARRIED HIM TO THE BED AND LAID HIM THERE AND COVERED HIM WARMLY AT ONCE HE FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
ANOTHER BED WAS SET BESIDE HIM FOR HIS SERVANT SAM HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN BOWING VERY LOW GOOD NIGHT CAPTAIN MY LORD HE SAID YOU TOOK THE CHANCE SIR
DID I SO SAID FARAMIR
YES SIR AND SHOWED YOUR QUALITY THE VERY HIGHEST
FARAMIR SMILED A PERT SERVANT MASTER SAMWISE BUT NAY THE PRAISE OF THE PRAISEWORTHY IS ABOVE ALL REWARDS YET THERE WAS NAUGHT IN THIS TO PRAISE I HAD NO LURE OR DESIRE TO DO OTHER THAN I HAVE DONE
AH WELL SIR SAID SAM YOU SAID MY MASTER HAD AN ELVISH AIR AND THAT WAS GOOD AND TRUE BUT I CAN SAY THIS YOU HAVE AN AIR TOO SIR THAT REMINDS ME OF OF  WELL GANDALF OF WIZARDS
MAYBE SAID FARAMIR MAYBE YOU DISCERN FROM FAR AWAY THE AIR OF NUMENOR GOOD NIGHT



CHAPTER 6
THE FORBIDDEN POOL

FRODO WOKE TO FIND FARAMIR BENDING OVER HIM FOR A SECOND OLD FEARS SEIZED HIM AND HE SAT UP AND SHRANK AWAY
THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR SAID FARAMIR
IS IT MORNING ALREADY SAID FRODO YAWNING
NOT YET BUT NIGHT IS DRAWING TO AN END AND THE FULL MOON IS SETTING WILL YOU COME AND SEE IT ALSO THERE IS A MATTER ON WHICH I DESIRE YOUR COUNSEL I AM SORRY TO ROUSE YOU FROM SLEEP BUT WILL YOU COME
I WILL SAID FRODO RISING AND SHIVERING A LITTLE AS HE LEFT THE WARM BLANKET AND PELTS IT SEEMED COLD IN THE FIRELESS CAVE THE NOISE OF THE WATER WAS LOUD IN THE STILLNESS HE PUT ON HIS CLOAK AND FOLLOWED FARAMIR
SAM WAKING SUDDENLY BY SOME INSTINCT OF WATCHFULNESS SAW FIRST HIS MASTERS EMPTY BED AND LEAPT TO HIS FEET THEN HE SAW TWO DARK FIGURES FRODO AND A MAN FRAMED AGAINST THE ARCHWAY WHICH WAS NOW FILLED WITH A PALE WHITE LIGHT HE HURRIED AFTER THEM PAST ROWS OF MEN SLEEPING ON MATTRESSES ALONG THE WALL AS HE WENT BY THE CAVEMOUTH HE SAW THAT THE CURTAIN WAS NOW BECOME A DAZZLING VEIL OF SILK AND PEARLS AND SILVER THREAD MELTING ICICLES OF MOONLIGHT BUT HE DID NOT PAUSE TO ADMIRE IT AND TURNING ASIDE HE FOLLOWED HIS MASTER THROUGH THE NARROW DOORWAY IN THE WALL OF THE CAVE
THEY WENT FIRST ALONG A BLACK PASSAGE THEN UP MANY WET STEPS AND SO CAME TO A SMALL FLAT LANDING CUT IN THE STONE AND LIT BY THE PALE SKY GLEAMING HIGH ABOVE THROUGH A LONG DEEP SHAFT FROM HERE TWO FLIGHTS OF STEPS LED ONE GOING ON AS IT SEEMED UP ON TO THE HIGH BANK OF THE STREAM THE OTHER TURNING AWAY TO THE LEFT THIS THEY FOLLOWED IT WOUND ITS WAY UP LIKE A TURRETSTAIR
AT LAST THEY CAME OUT OF THE STONY DARKNESS AND LOOKED ABOUT THEY WERE ON A WIDE FLAT ROCK WITHOUT RAIL OR PARAPET AT THEIR RIGHT EASTWARDS THE TORRENT FELL SPLASHING OVER MANY TERRACES AND THEN POURING DOWN A STEEP RACE IT FILLED A SMOOTHHEWN CHANNEL WITH A DARK FORCE OF WATER FLECKED WITH FOAM AND CURLING AND RUSHING ALMOST AT THEIR FEET IT PLUNGED SHEER OVER THE EDGE THAT YAWNED UPON THEIR LEFT A MAN STOOD THERE NEAR THE BRINK SILENT GAZING DOWN
FRODO TURNED TO WATCH THE SLEEK NECKS OF THE WATER AS THEY CURVED AND DIVED THEN HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND GAZED FAR AWAY THE WORLD WAS QUIET AND COLD AS IF DAWN WERE NEAR FAR OFF IN THE WEST THE FULL MOON WAS SINKING ROUND AND WHITE PALE MISTS SHIMMERED IN THE GREAT VALE BELOW A WIDE GULF OF SILVER FUME BENEATH WHICH ROLLED THE COOL NIGHTWATERS OF THE ANDUIN A BLACK DARKNESS LOOMED BEYOND AND IN IT GLINTED HERE AND THERE COLD SHARP REMOTE WHITE AS THE TEETH OF GHOSTS THE PEAKS OF ERED NIMRAIS THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OF THE REALM OF GONDOR TIPPED WITH EVERLASTING SNOW
FOR A WHILE FRODO STOOD THERE ON THE HIGH STONE AND A SHIVER RAN THROUGH HIM WONDERING IF ANYWHERE IN THE VASTNESS OF THE NIGHTLANDS HIS OLD COMPANIONS WALKED OR SLEPT OR LAY DEAD SHROUDED IN MIST WHY WAS HE BROUGHT HERE OUT OF FORGETFUL SLEEP
SAM WAS EAGER FOR AN ANSWER TO THE SAME QUESTION AND COULD NOT REFRAIN HIMSELF FROM MUTTERING FOR HIS MASTERS EAR ALONE AS HE THOUGHT ITS A FINE VIEW NO DOUBT MR FRODO BUT CHILLY TO THE HEART NOT TO MENTION THE BONES WHATS GOING ON
FARAMIR HEARD AND ANSWERED MOONSET OVER GONDOR FAIR ITHIL AS HE GOES FROM MIDDLEEARTH GLANCES UPON THE WHITE LOCKS OF OLD MINDOLLUIN IT IS WORTH A FEW SHIVERS BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I BROUGHT YOU TO SEE  THOUGH AS FOR YOU SAMWISE YOU WERE NOT BROUGHT AND DO BUT PAY THE PENALTY OF YOUR WATCHFULNESS A DRAUGHT OF WINE SHALL AMEND IT COME LOOK NOW
HE STEPPED UP BESIDE THE SILENT SENTINEL ON THE DARK EDGE AND FRODO FOLLOWED SAM HUNG BACK HE ALREADY FELT INSECURE ENOUGH ON THIS HIGH WET PLATFORM FARAMIR AND FRODO LOOKED DOWN FAR BELOW THEM THEY SAW THE WHITE WATERS POUR INTO A FOAMING BOWL AND THEN SWIRL DARKLY ABOUT A DEEP OVAL BASIN IN THE ROCKS UNTIL THEY FOUND THEIR WAY OUT AGAIN THROUGH A NARROW GATE AND FLOWED AWAY FUMING AND CHATTERING INTO CALMER AND MORE LEVEL REACHES THE MOONLIGHT STILL SLANTED DOWN TO THE FALLS FOOT AND GLEAMED ON THE RIPPLES OF THE BASIN PRESENTLY FRODO WAS AWARE OF A SMALL DARK THING ON THE NEAR BANK BUT EVEN AS HE LOOKED AT IT IT DIVED AND VANISHED JUST BEYOND THE BOIL AND BUBBLE OF THE FALL CLEAVING THE BLACK WATER AS NEATLY AS AN ARROW OR AN EDGEWISE STONE
FARAMIR TURNED TO THE MAN AT HIS SIDE NOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT IT IS ANBORN A SQUIRREL OR A KINGFISHER ARE THERE BLACK KINGFISHERS IN THE NIGHTPOOLS OF MIRKWOOD
TIS NOT A BIRD WHATEVER ELSE IT BE ANSWERED ANBORN IT HAS FOUR LIMBS AND DIVES MANWISE A PRETTY MASTERY OF THE CRAFT IT SHOWS TOO WHAT IS IT AT SEEKING A WAY UP BEHIND THE CURTAIN TO OUR HIDINGS IT SEEMS WE ARE DISCOVERED AT LAST I HAVE MY BOW HERE AND I HAVE POSTED OTHER ARCHERS NIGH AS GOOD MARKSMEN AS MYSELF ON EITHER BANK WE WAIT ONLY FOR YOUR COMMAND TO SHOOT CAPTAIN
SHALL WE SHOOT SAID FARAMIR TURNING QUICKLY TO FRODO
FRODO DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MOMENT THEN NO HE SAID NO I BEG YOU NOT TO IF SAM HAD DARED HE WOULD HAVE SAID YES QUICKER AND LOUDER HE COULD NOT SEE BUT HE GUESSED WELL ENOUGH FROM THEIR WORDS WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT
YOU KNOW THEN WHAT THIS THING IS SAID FARAMIR COME NOW YOU HAVE SEEN TELL ME WHY IT SHOULD BE SPARED IN ALL OUR WORDS TOGETHER YOU HAVE NOT ONCE SPOKEN OF YOUR GANGREL COMPANION AND I LET HIM BE FOR THE TIME HE COULD WAIT TILL HE WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE ME I SENT MY KEENEST HUNTSMEN TO SEEK HIM BUT HE SLIPPED THEM AND THEY HAD NO SIGHT OF HIM TILL NOW SAVE ANBORN HERE ONCE AT DUSK YESTEREVENING BUT NOW HE HAS DONE WORSE TRESPASS THAN ONLY TO GO CONEYSNARING IN THE UPLANDS HE HAS DARED TO COME TO HENNETH ANNUN AND HIS LIFE IS FORFEIT I MARVEL AT THE CREATURE SO SECRET AND SO SLY AS HE IS TO COME SPORTING IN THE POOL BEFORE OUR VERY WINDOW DOES HE THINK THAT MEN SLEEP WITHOUT WATCH ALL NIGHT WHY DOES HE SO
THERE ARE TWO ANSWERS I THINK SAID FRODO FOR ONE THING HE KNOWS LITTLE OF MEN AND SLY THOUGH HE IS YOUR REFUGE IS SO HIDDEN THAT PERHAPS HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT MEN ARE CONCEALED HERE FOR ANOTHER I THINK HE IS ALLURED HERE BY A MASTERING DESIRE STRONGER THAN HIS CAUTION
HE IS LURED HERE YOU SAY SAID FARAMIR IN A LOW VOICE CAN HE DOES HE THEN KNOW OF YOUR BURDEN
INDEED YES HE BORE IT HIMSELF FOR MANY YEARS
HE BORE IT SAID FARAMIR BREATHING SHARPLY IN HIS WONDER THIS MATTER WINDS ITSELF EVER IN NEW RIDDLES THEN HE IS PURSUING IT
MAYBE IT IS PRECIOUS TO HIM BUT I DID NOT SPEAK OF THAT
WHAT THEN DOES THE CREATURE SEEK
FISH SAID FRODO LOOK
THEY PEERED DOWN AT THE DARK POOL A LITTLE BLACK HEAD APPEARED AT THE FAR END OF THE BASIN JUST OUT OF THE DEEP SHADOW OF THE ROCKS THERE WAS A BRIEF SILVER GLINT AND A SWIRL OF TINY RIPPLES IT SWAM TO THE SIDE AND THEN WITH MARVELLOUS AGILITY A FROGLIKE FIGURE CLIMBED OUT OF THE WATER AND UP THE BANK AT ONCE IT SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO GNAW AT THE SMALL SILVER THING THAT GLITTERED AS IT TURNED THE LAST RAYS OF THE MOON WERE NOW FALLING BEHIND THE STONY WALL AT THE POOLS END
FARAMIR LAUGHED SOFTLY FISH HE SAID IT IS A LESS PERILOUS HUNGER OR MAYBE NOT FISH FROM THE POOL OF HENNETH ANNUN MAY COST HIM ALL HE HAS TO GIVE
NOW I HAVE HIM AT THE ARROWPOINT SAID ANBORN SHALL I NOT SHOOT CAPTAIN FOR COMING UNBIDDEN TO THIS PLACE DEATH IS OUR LAW

ANBORN GRUNTED AND LED THE WAY DOWN THE WINDING STAIR TO THE LANDING AND THEN UP THE OTHER STAIR UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO A NARROW OPENING SHROUDED WITH THICK BUSHES PASSING SILENTLY THROUGH FRODO FOUND HIMSELF ON THE TOP OF THE SOUTHERN BANK ABOVE THE POOL IT WAS NOW DARK AND THE FALLS WERE PALE AND GREY REFLECTING ONLY THE LINGERING MOONLIGHT OF THE WESTERN SKY HE COULD NOT SEE GOLLUM HE WENT FORWARD A SHORT WAY AND ANBORN CAME SOFTLY BEHIND HIM
GO ON HE BREATHED IN FRODOS EAR HAVE A CARE TO YOUR RIGHT IF YOU FALL IN THE POOL THEN NO ONE BUT YOUR FISHING FRIEND CAN HELP YOU AND FORGET NOT THAT THERE ARE BOWMEN NEAR AT HAND THOUGH YOU MAY NOT SEE THEM
FRODO CREPT FORWARD USING HIS HANDS GOLLUMLIKE TO FEEL HIS WAY AND TO STEADY HIMSELF THE ROCKS WERE FOR THE MOST PART FLAT AND SMOOTH BUT SLIPPERY HE HALTED LISTENING AT FIRST HE COULD HEAR NO SOUND BUT THE UNCEASING RUSH OF THE FALL BEHIND HIM THEN PRESENTLY HE HEARD NOT FAR AHEAD A HISSING MURMUR

GOLLUM CRAWLED ALONG CLOSE TO THE BRINK FOR A LITTLE WAY SNUFFLING AND SUSPICIOUS PRESENTLY HE STOPPED AND RAISED HIS HEAD SOMETHINGS THERE HE SAID NOT A HOBBIT SUDDENLY HE TURNED BACK A GREEN LIGHT WAS FLICKERING IN HIS BULGING EYES MASSTER MASSTER HE HISSED WICKED TRICKSY FALSE HE SPAT AND STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG ARMS WITH WHITE SNAPPING FINGERS
AT THAT MOMENT THE GREAT BLACK SHAPE OF ANBORN LOOMED UP BEHIND HIM AND CAME DOWN ON HIM A LARGE STRONG HAND TOOK HIM IN THE NAPE OF THE NECK AND PINNED HIM HE TWISTED ROUND LIKE LIGHTNING ALL WET AND SLIMY AS HE WAS WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL BITING AND SCRATCHING LIKE A CAT BUT TWO MORE MEN CAME UP OUT OF THE SHADOWS

GOLLUM TURNED AND SPAT AT HIM THE MEN PICKED HIM UP PUT A HOOD OVER HIS EYES AND CARRIED HIM OFF
FRODO FOLLOWED THEM FEELING VERY WRETCHED THEY WENT THROUGH THE OPENING BEHIND THE BUSHES AND BACK DOWN THE STAIRS AND PASSAGES INTO THE CAVE TWO OR THREE TORCHES HAD BEEN LIT MEN WERE STIRRING SAM WAS THERE AND HE GAVE A QUEER LOOK AT THE LIMP BUNDLE THAT THE MEN CARRIED GOT HIM HE SAID TO FRODO

SO DO I SAID SAM AND NOTHING WILL EVER BE ALL RIGHT WHERE THAT PIECE OF MISERY IS
A MAN CAME AND BECKONED TO THE HOBBITS AND TOOK THEM TO THE RECESS AT THE BACK OF THE CAVE FARAMIR WAS SITTING THERE IN HIS CHAIR AND THE LAMP HAD BEEN REKINDLED IN ITS NICHE ABOVE HIS HEAD HE SIGNED TO THEM TO SIT DOWN ON THE STOOLS BESIDE HIM BRING WINE FOR THE GUESTS HE SAID AND BRING THE PRISONER TO ME
THE WINE WAS BROUGHT AND THEN ANBORN CAME CARRYING GOLLUM HE REMOVED THE COVER FROM GOLLUMS HEAD AND SET HIM ON HIS FEET STANDING BEHIND HIM TO SUPPORT HIM GOLLUM BLINKED HOODING THE MALICE OF HIS EYES WITH THEIR HEAVY PALE LIDS A VERY MISERABLE CREATURE HE LOOKED DRIPPING AND DANK SMELLING OF FISH HE STILL CLUTCHED ONE IN HIS HAND HIS SPARSE LOCKS WERE HANGING LIKE RANK WEED OVER HIS BONY BROWS HIS NOSE WAS SNIVELLING
LOOSE US LOOSE US HE SAID THE CORD HURTS US YES IT DOES IT HURTS US AND WEVE DONE NOTHING
NOTHING SAID FARAMIR LOOKING AT THE WRETCHED CREATURE WITH A KEEN GLANCE BUT WITHOUT ANY EXPRESSION IN HIS FACE EITHER OF ANGER OR PITY OR WONDER NOTHING HAVE YOU NEVER DONE ANYTHING WORTHY OF BINDING OR OF WORSE PUNISHMENT HOWEVER THAT IS NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE HAPPILY BUT TONIGHT YOU HAVE COME WHERE IT IS DEATH TO COME THE FISH OF THIS POOL ARE DEARLY BOUGHT
GOLLUM DROPPED THE FISH FROM HIS HAND DONT WANT FISH HE SAID
THE PRICE IS NOT SET ON THE FISH SAID FARAMIR ONLY TO COME HERE AND LOOK ON THE POOL BEARS THE PENALTY OF DEATH I HAVE SPARED YOU SO FAR AT THE PRAYER OF FRODO HERE WHO SAYS THAT OF HIM AT LEAST YOU HAVE DESERVED SOME THANKS BUT YOU MUST ALSO SATISFY ME WHAT IS YOUR NAME WHENCE DO YOU COME AND WHITHER DO YOU GO WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS

COME HITHER SAID FARAMIR LOOK AT ME DO YOU KNOW THE NAME OF THIS PLACE HAVE YOU BEEN HERE BEFORE
SLOWLY GOLLUM RAISED HIS EYES AND LOOKED UNWILLINGLY INTO FARAMIRS ALL LIGHT WENT OUT OF THEM AND THEY STARED BLEAK AND PALE FOR A MOMENT INTO THE CLEAR UNWAVERING EYES OF THE MAN OF GONDOR THERE WAS A STILL SILENCE THEN GOLLUM DROPPED HIS HEAD AND SHRANK DOWN UNTIL HE WAS SQUATTING ON THE FLOOR SHIVERING WE DOESNT KNOW AND WE DOESNT WANT TO KNOW HE WHIMPERED NEVER CAME HERE NEVER COME AGAIN
THERE ARE LOCKED DOORS AND CLOSED WINDOWS IN YOUR MIND AND DARK ROOMS BEHIND THEM SAID FARAMIR BUT IN THIS I JUDGE THAT YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH IT IS WELL FOR YOU WHAT OATH WILL YOU SWEAR NEVER TO RETURN AND NEVER TO LEAD ANY LIVING CREATURE HITHER BY WORD OR SIGN
MASTER KNOWS SAID GOLLUM WITH A SIDELONG GLANCE AT FRODO YES HE KNOWS WE WILL PROMISE MASTER IF HE SAVES US WELL PROMISE TO IT YES HE CRAWLED TO FRODOS FEET SAVE US NICE MASTER HE WHINED SMEAGOL PROMISES TO PRECIOUS PROMISES FAITHFULLY NEVER COME AGAIN NEVER SPEAK NO NEVER NO PRECIOUS NO

YES SAID FRODO AT LEAST YOU MUST EITHER ACCEPT THIS PROMISE OR CARRY OUT YOUR LAW YOU WILL GET NO MORE BUT I PROMISED THAT IF HE CAME TO ME HE SHOULD NOT BE HARMED AND I WOULD NOT BE PROVED FAITHLESS
FARAMIR SAT FOR A MOMENT IN THOUGHT VERY GOOD HE SAID AT LAST I SURRENDER YOU TO YOUR MASTER TO FRODO SON OF DROGO LET HIM DECLARE WHAT HE WILL DO WITH YOU
BUT LORD FARAMIR SAID FRODO BOWING YOU HAVE NOT YET DECLARED YOUR WILL CONCERNING THE SAID FRODO AND UNTIL THAT IS MADE KNOWN HE CANNOT SHAPE HIS PLANS FOR HIMSELF OR HIS COMPANIONS YOUR JUDGEMENT WAS POSTPONED UNTIL THE MORNING BUT THAT IS NOW AT HAND
THEN I WILL DECLARE MY DOOM SAID FARAMIR AS FOR YOU FRODO IN SO FAR AS LIES IN ME UNDER HIGHER AUTHORITY I DECLARE YOU FREE IN THE REALM OF GONDOR TO THE FURTHEST OF ITS ANCIENT BOUNDS SAVE ONLY THAT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY THAT GO WITH YOU HAVE LEAVE TO COME TO THIS PLACE UNBIDDEN THIS DOOM SHALL STAND FOR A YEAR AND A DAY AND THEN CEASE UNLESS YOU SHALL BEFORE THAT TERM COME TO MINAS TIRITH AND PRESENT YOURSELF TO THE LORD AND STEWARD OF THE CITY THEN I WILL ENTREAT HIM TO CONFIRM WHAT I HAVE DONE AND TO MAKE IT LIFELONG IN THE MEANTIME WHOMSOEVER YOU TAKE UNDER YOUR PROTECTION SHALL BE UNDER MY PROTECTION AND UNDER THE SHIELD OF GONDOR ARE YOU ANSWERED
FRODO BOWED LOW I AM ANSWERED HE SAID AND I PLACE MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE IF THAT IS OF ANY WORTH TO ONE SO HIGH AND HONOURABLE
IT IS OF GREAT WORTH SAID FARAMIR AND NOW DO YOU TAKE THIS CREATURE THIS SMEAGOL UNDER YOUR PROTECTION
I DO TAKE SMEAGOL UNDER MY PROTECTION SAID FRODO SAM SIGHED AUDIBLY AND NOT AT THE COURTESIES OF WHICH AS ANY HOBBIT WOULD HE THOROUGHLY APPROVED INDEED IN THE SHIRE SUCH A MATTER WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A GREAT MANY MORE WORDS AND BOWS
THEN I SAY TO YOU SAID FARAMIR TURNING TO GOLLUM YOU ARE UNDER DOOM OF DEATH BUT WHILE YOU WALK WITH FRODO YOU ARE SAFE FOR OUR PART YET IF EVER YOU BE FOUND BY ANY MAN OF GONDOR ASTRAY WITHOUT HIM THE DOOM SHALL FALL AND MAY DEATH FIND YOU SWIFTLY WITHIN GONDOR OR WITHOUT IF YOU DO NOT WELL SERVE HIM NOW ANSWER ME WHITHER WOULD YOU GO YOU WERE HIS GUIDE HE SAYS WHITHER WERE YOU LEADING HIM GOLLUM MADE NO REPLY
THIS I WILL NOT HAVE SECRET SAID FARAMIR ANSWER ME OR I WILL REVERSE MY JUDGEMENT STILL GOLLUM DID NOT ANSWER
I WILL ANSWER FOR HIM SAID FRODO HE BROUGHT ME TO THE BLACK GATE AS I ASKED BUT IT WAS IMPASSABLE
THERE IS NO OPEN GATE INTO THE NAMELESS LAND SAID FARAMIR
SEEING THIS WE TURNED ASIDE AND CAME BY THE SOUTHWARD ROAD FRODO CONTINUED FOR HE SAID THAT THERE IS OR THERE MAY BE A PATH NEAR TO MINAS ITHIL
MINAS MORGUL SAID FARAMIR
I DO NOT KNOW CLEARLY SAID FRODO BUT THE PATH CLIMBS I THINK UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THAT VALE WHERE THE OLD CITY STANDS IT GOES UP TO A HIGH CLEFT AND SO DOWN TO  THAT WHICH IS BEYOND
DO YOU KNOW THE NAME OF THAT HIGH PASS SAID FARAMIR
NO SAID FRODO
IT IS CALLED CIRITH UNGOL GOLLUM HISSED SHARPLY AND BEGAN MUTTERING TO HIMSELF IS NOT THAT ITS NAME SAID FARAMIR TURNING TO HIM
NO SAID GOLLUM AND THEN HE SQUEALED AS IF SOMETHING HAD STABBED HIM YES YES WE HEARD THE NAME ONCE BUT WHAT DOES THE NAME MATTER TO US MASTER SAYS HE MUST GET IN SO WE MUST TRY SOME WAY THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO TRY NO
NO OTHER WAY SAID FARAMIR HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT AND WHO HAS EXPLORED ALL THE CONFINES OF THAT DARK REALM HE LOOKED LONG AND THOUGHTFULLY AT GOLLUM PRESENTLY HE SPOKE AGAIN TAKE THIS CREATURE AWAY ANBORN TREAT HIM GENTLY BUT WATCH HIM AND DO NOT YOU SMEAGOL TRY TO DIVE INTO THE FALLS THE ROCKS HAVE SUCH TEETH THERE AS WOULD SLAY YOU BEFORE YOUR TIME LEAVE US NOW AND TAKE YOUR FISH
ANBORN WENT OUT AND GOLLUM WENT CRINGING BEFORE HIM THE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN ACROSS THE RECESS
FRODO I THINK YOU DO VERY UNWISELY IN THIS SAID FARAMIR I DO NOT THINK YOU SHOULD GO WITH THIS CREATURE IT IS WICKED
NO NOT ALTOGETHER WICKED SAID FRODO
NOT WHOLLY PERHAPS SAID FARAMIR BUT MALICE EATS IT LIKE A CANKER AND THE EVIL IS GROWING HE WILL LEAD YOU TO NO GOOD IF YOU WILL PART WITH HIM I WILL GIVE HIM SAFECONDUCT AND GUIDANCE TO ANY POINT ON THE BORDERS OF GONDOR THAT HE MAY NAME
HE WOULD NOT TAKE IT SAID FRODO HE WOULD FOLLOW AFTER ME AS HE LONG HAS DONE AND I HAVE PROMISED MANY TIMES TO TAKE HIM UNDER MY PROTECTION AND TO GO WHERE HE LED YOU WOULD NOT ASK ME TO BREAK FAITH WITH HIM
NO SAID FARAMIR BUT MY HEART WOULD FOR IT SEEMS LESS EVIL TO COUNSEL ANOTHER MAN TO BREAK TROTH THAN TO DO SO ONESELF ESPECIALLY IF ONE SEES A FRIEND BOUND UNWITTING TO HIS OWN HARM BUT NO  IF HE WILL GO WITH YOU YOU MUST NOW ENDURE HIM BUT I DO NOT THINK YOU ARE HOLDEN TO GO TO CIRITH UNGOL OF WHICH HE HAS TOLD YOU LESS THAN HE KNOWS THAT MUCH I PERCEIVED CLEARLY IN HIS MIND DO NOT GO TO CIRITH UNGOL
WHERE THEN SHALL I GO SAID FRODO BACK TO THE BLACK GATE AND DELIVER MYSELF UP TO THE GUARD WHAT DO YOU KNOW AGAINST THIS PLACE THAT MAKES ITS NAME SO DREADFUL
NOTHING CERTAIN SAID FARAMIR WE OF GONDOR DO NOT EVER PASS EAST OF THE ROAD IN THESE DAYS AND NONE OF US YOUNGER MEN HAS EVER DONE SO NOR HAS ANY OF US SET FOOT UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW OF THEM WE KNOW ONLY OLD REPORT AND THE RUMOUR OF BYGONE DAYS BUT THERE IS SOME DARK TERROR THAT DWELLS IN THE PASSES ABOVE MINAS MORGUL IF CIRITH UNGOL IS NAMED OLD MEN AND MASTERS OF LORE WILL BLANCH AND FALL SILENT
THE VALLEY OF MINAS MORGUL PASSED INTO EVIL VERY LONG AGO AND IT WAS A MENACE AND A DREAD WHILE THE BANISHED ENEMY DWELT YET FAR AWAY AND ITHILIEN WAS STILL FOR THE MOST PART IN OUR KEEPING AS YOU KNOW THAT CITY WAS ONCE A STRONG PLACE PROUD AND FAIR MINAS ITHIL THE TWIN SISTER OF OUR OWN CITY BUT IT WAS TAKEN BY FELL MEN WHOM THE ENEMY IN HIS FIRST STRENGTH HAD DOMINATED AND WHO WANDERED HOMELESS AND MASTERLESS AFTER HIS FALL IT IS SAID THAT THEIR LORDS WERE MEN OF NUMENOR WHO HAD FALLEN INTO DARK WICKEDNESS TO THEM THE ENEMY HAD GIVEN RINGS OF POWER AND HE HAD DEVOURED THEM LIVING GHOSTS THEY WERE BECOME TERRIBLE AND EVIL AFTER HIS GOING THEY TOOK MINAS ITHIL AND DWELT THERE AND THEY FILLED IT AND ALL THE VALLEY ABOUT WITH DECAY IT SEEMED EMPTY AND WAS NOT SO FOR A SHAPELESS FEAR LIVED WITHIN THE RUINED WALLS NINE LORDS THERE WERE AND AFTER THE RETURN OF THEIR MASTER WHICH THEY AIDED AND PREPARED IN SECRET THEY GREW STRONG AGAIN THEN THE NINE RIDERS ISSUED FORTH FROM THE GATES OF HORROR AND WE COULD NOT WITHSTAND THEM DO NOT APPROACH THEIR CITADEL YOU WILL BE ESPIED IT IS A PLACE OF SLEEPLESS MALICE FULL OF LIDLESS EYES DO NOT GO THAT WAY
BUT WHERE ELSE WILL YOU DIRECT ME SAID FRODO YOU CANNOT YOURSELF YOU SAY GUIDE ME TO THE MOUNTAINS NOR OVER THEM BUT OVER THE MOUNTAINS I AM BOUND BY SOLEMN UNDERTAKING TO THE COUNCIL TO FIND A WAY OR PERISH IN THE SEEKING AND IF I TURN BACK REFUSING THE ROAD IN ITS BITTER END WHERE THEN SHALL I GO AMONG ELVES OR MEN WOULD YOU HAVE ME COME TO GONDOR WITH THIS THING THE THING THAT DROVE YOUR BROTHER MAD WITH DESIRE WHAT SPELL WOULD IT WORK IN MINAS TIRITH SHALL THERE BE TWO CITIES OF MINAS MORGUL GRINNING AT EACH OTHER ACROSS A DEAD LAND FILLED WITH ROTTENNESS
I WOULD NOT HAVE IT SO SAID FARAMIR
THEN WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO
I KNOW NOT ONLY I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU GO TO DEATH OR TO TORMENT AND I DO NOT THINK THAT MITHRANDIR WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THIS WAY
YET SINCE HE IS GONE I MUST TAKE SUCH PATHS AS I CAN FIND AND THERE IS NO TIME FOR LONG SEARCHING SAID FRODO
IT IS A HARD DOOM AND A HOPELESS ERRAND SAID FARAMIR BUT AT THE LEAST REMEMBER MY WARNING BEWARE OF THIS GUIDE SMEAGOL HE HAS DONE MURDER BEFORE NOW I READ IT IN HIM HE SIGHED
WELL SO WE MEET AND PART FRODO SON OF DROGO YOU HAVE NO NEED OF SOFT WORDS I DO NOT HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN ON ANY OTHER DAY UNDER THIS SUN BUT YOU SHALL GO NOW WITH MY BLESSING UPON YOU AND UPON ALL YOUR PEOPLE REST A LITTLE WHILE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR YOU
I WOULD GLADLY LEARN HOW THIS CREEPING SMEAGOL BECAME POSSESSED OF THE THING OF WHICH WE SPEAK AND HOW HE LOST IT BUT I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU NOW IF EVER BEYOND HOPE YOU RETURN TO THE LANDS OF THE LIVING AND WE RETELL OUR TALES SITTING BY A WALL IN THE SUN LAUGHING AT OLD GRIEF YOU SHALL TELL ME THEN UNTIL THAT TIME OR SOME OTHER TIME BEYOND THE VISION OF THE SEEINGSTONES OF NUMENOR FAREWELL
HE ROSE AND BOWED LOW TO FRODO AND DRAWING THE CURTAIN PASSED OUT INTO THE CAVE



CHAPTER 7
JOURNEY TO THE CROSSROADS

FRODO AND SAM RETURNED TO THEIR BEDS AND LAY THERE IN SILENCE RESTING FOR A LITTLE WHILE MEN BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AND THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY BEGAN AFTER A WHILE WATER WAS BROUGHT TO THEM AND THEN THEY WERE LED TO A TABLE WHERE FOOD WAS SET FOR THREE FARAMIR BROKE HIS FAST WITH THEM HE HAD NOT SLEPT SINCE THE BATTLE ON THE DAY BEFORE YET HE DID NOT LOOK WEARY
WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEY STOOD UP MAY NO HUNGER TROUBLE YOU ON THE ROAD SAID FARAMIR YOU HAVE LITTLE PROVISION BUT SOME SMALL STORE OF FOOD FIT FOR TRAVELLERS I HAVE ORDERED TO BE STOWED IN YOUR PACKS YOU WILL HAVE NO LACK OF WATER AS YOU WALK IN ITHILIEN BUT DO NOT DRINK OF ANY STREAM THAT FLOWS FROM IMLAD MORGUL THE VALLEY OF LIVING DEATH THIS ALSO I MUST TELL YOU MY SCOUTS AND WATCHERS HAVE ALL RETURNED EVEN SOME THAT HAVE CREPT WITHIN SIGHT OF THE MORANNON THEY ALL FIND A STRANGE THING THE LAND IS EMPTY NOTHING IS ON THE ROAD AND NO SOUND OF FOOT OR HORN OR BOWSTRING IS ANYWHERE TO BE HEARD A WAITING SILENCE BROODS ABOVE THE NAMELESS LAND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS PORTENDS BUT THE TIME DRAWS SWIFTLY TO SOME GREAT CONCLUSION STORM IS COMING HASTEN WHILE YOU MAY IF YOU ARE READY LET US GO THE SUN WILL SOON RISE ABOVE THE SHADOW
THE HOBBITS PACKS WERE BROUGHT TO THEM A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND ALSO TWO STOUT STAVES OF POLISHED WOOD SHOD WITH IRON AND WITH CARVEN HEADS THROUGH WHICH RAN PLAITED LEATHERN THONGS
I HAVE NO FITTING GIFTS TO GIVE YOU AT OUR PARTING SAID FARAMIR BUT TAKE THESE STAVES THEY MAY BE OF SERVICE TO THOSE WHO WALK OR CLIMB IN THE WILD THE MEN OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS USE THEM THOUGH THESE HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN TO YOUR HEIGHT AND NEWLY SHOD THEY ARE MADE OF THE FAIR TREE LEBETHRON BELOVED OF THE WOODWRIGHTS OF GONDOR AND A VIRTUE HAS BEEN SET UPON THEM OF FINDING AND RETURNING MAY THAT VIRTUE NOT WHOLLY FAIL UNDER THE SHADOW INTO WHICH YOU GO
THE HOBBITS BOWED LOW MOST GRACIOUS HOST SAID FRODO IT WAS SAID TO ME BY ELROND HALFELVEN THAT I SHOULD FIND FRIENDSHIP UPON THE WAY SECRET AND UNLOOKED FOR CERTAINLY I LOOKED FOR NO SUCH FRIENDSHIP AS YOU HAVE SHOWN TO HAVE FOUND IT TURNS EVIL TO GREAT GOOD
NOW THEY MADE READY TO DEPART GOLLUM WAS BROUGHT OUT OF SOME CORNER OR HIDINGHOLE AND HE SEEMED BETTER PLEASED WITH HIMSELF THAN HE HAD BEEN THOUGH HE KEPT CLOSE TO FRODO AND AVOIDED THE GLANCE OF FARAMIR
YOUR GUIDE MUST BE BLINDFOLDED SAID FARAMIR BUT YOU AND YOUR SERVANT SAMWISE I RELEASE FROM THIS IF YOU WISH
GOLLUM SQUEALED AND SQUIRMED AND CLUTCHED AT FRODO WHEN THEY CAME TO BIND HIS EYES AND FRODO SAID BLINDFOLD US ALL THREE AND COVER UP MY EYES FIRST AND THEN PERHAPS HE WILL SEE THAT NO HARM IS MEANT THIS WAS DONE AND THEY WERE LED FROM THE CAVE OF HENNETH ANNUN AFTER THEY HAD PASSED THE PASSAGES AND STAIRS THEY FELT THE COOL MORNING AIR FRESH AND SWEET ABOUT THEM STILL BLIND THEY WENT ON FOR SOME LITTLE TIME UP AND THEN GENTLY DOWN AT LAST THE VOICE OF FARAMIR ORDERED THEM TO BE UNCOVERED
THEY STOOD UNDER THE BOUGHS OF THE WOODS AGAIN NO NOISE OF THE FALLS COULD BE HEARD FOR A LONG SOUTHWARD SLOPE LAY NOW BETWEEN THEM AND THE RAVINE IN WHICH THE STREAM FLOWED TO THE WEST THEY COULD SEE LIGHT THROUGH THE TREES AS IF THE WORLD CAME THERE TO A SUDDEN END AT A BRINK LOOKING OUT ONLY ON TO SKY
HERE IS THE LAST PARTING OF OUR WAYS SAID FARAMIR IF YOU TAKE MY COUNSEL YOU WILL NOT TURN EASTWARD YET GO STRAIGHT ON FOR THUS YOU WILL HAVE THE COVER OF THE WOODLAND FOR MANY MILES ON YOUR WEST IS AN EDGE WHERE THE LAND FALLS INTO THE GREAT VALES SOMETIMES SUDDENLY AND SHEER SOMETIMES IN LONG HILLSIDES KEEP NEAR TO THIS EDGE AND THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST IN THE BEGINNING OF YOUR JOURNEY YOU MAY WALK UNDER DAYLIGHT I THINK THE LAND DREAMS IN A FALSE PEACE AND FOR A WHILE ALL EVIL IS WITHDRAWN FARE YOU WELL WHILE YOU MAY
HE EMBRACED THE HOBBITS THEN AFTER THE MANNER OF HIS PEOPLE STOOPING AND PLACING HIS HANDS UPON THEIR SHOULDERS AND KISSING THEIR FOREHEADS GO WITH THE GOOD WILL OF ALL GOOD MEN HE SAID
THEY BOWED TO THE GROUND THEN HE TURNED AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK HE LEFT THEM AND WENT TO HIS TWO GUARDS THAT STOOD AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY THEY MARVELLED TO SEE WITH WHAT SPEED THESE GREENCLAD MEN NOW MOVED VANISHING ALMOST IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE FOREST WHERE FARAMIR HAD STOOD SEEMED EMPTY AND DREAR AS IF A DREAM HAD PASSED
FRODO SIGHED AND TURNED BACK SOUTHWARD AS IF TO MARK HIS DISREGARD OF ALL SUCH COURTESY GOLLUM WAS SCRABBLING IN THE MOULD AT THE FOOT OF A TREE HUNGRY AGAIN ALREADY THOUGHT SAM WELL NOW FOR IT AGAIN
HAVE THEY GONE AT LAST SAID GOLLUM NASSTY WICKED MEN SMEAGOLS NECK STILL HURTS HIM YES IT DOES LETS GO
YES LET US GO SAID FRODO BUT IF YOU CAN ONLY SPEAK ILL OF THOSE WHO SHOWED YOU MERCY KEEP SILENT
NICE MASTER SAID GOLLUM SMEAGOL WAS ONLY JOKING ALWAYS FORGIVES HE DOES YES YES EVEN NICE MASTERS LITTLE TRICKSES OH YES NICE MASTER NICE SMEAGOL
FRODO AND SAM DID NOT ANSWER HOISTING THEIR PACKS AND TAKING THEIR STAVES IN HAND THEY PASSED ON INTO THE WOODS OF ITHILIEN
TWICE THAT DAY THEY RESTED AND TOOK A LITTLE OF THE FOOD PROVIDED BY FARAMIR DRIED FRUITS AND SALTED MEAT ENOUGH FOR MANY DAYS AND BREAD ENOUGH TO LAST WHILE IT WAS STILL FRESH GOLLUM ATE NOTHING
THE SUN ROSE AND PASSED OVERHEAD UNSEEN AND BEGAN TO SINK AND THE LIGHT THROUGH THE TREES TO THE WEST GREW GOLDEN AND ALWAYS THEY WALKED IN COOL GREEN SHADOW AND ALL ABOUT THEM WAS SILENCE THE BIRDS SEEMED ALL TO HAVE FLOWN AWAY OR TO HAVE FALLEN DUMB
DARKNESS CAME EARLY TO THE SILENT WOODS AND BEFORE THE FALL OF NIGHT THEY HALTED WEARY FOR THEY HAD WALKED SEVEN LEAGUES OR MORE FROM HENNETH ANNUN FRODO LAY AND SLEPT AWAY THE NIGHT ON THE DEEP MOULD BENEATH AN ANCIENT TREE SAM BESIDE HIM WAS MORE UNEASY HE WOKE MANY TIMES BUT THERE WAS NEVER A SIGN OF GOLLUM WHO HAD SLIPPED OFF AS SOON AS THE OTHERS HAD SETTLED TO REST WHETHER HE HAD SLEPT BY HIMSELF IN SOME HOLE NEARBY OR HAD WANDERED RESTLESSLY PROWLING THROUGH THE NIGHT HE DID NOT SAY BUT HE RETURNED WITH THE FIRST GLIMMER OF LIGHT AND ROUSED HIS COMPANIONS
MUST GET UP YES THEY MUST HE SAID LONG WAYS TO GO STILL SOUTH AND EAST HOBBITS MUST MAKE HASTE
THAT DAY PASSED MUCH AS THE DAY BEFORE HAD GONE EXCEPT THAT THE SILENCE SEEMED DEEPER THE AIR GREW HEAVY AND IT BEGAN TO BE STIFLING UNDER THE TREES IT FELT AS IF THUNDER WAS BREWING GOLLUM OFTEN PAUSED SNIFFING THE AIR AND THEN HE WOULD MUTTER TO HIMSELF AND URGE THEM TO GREATER SPEED
AS THE THIRD STAGE OF THEIR DAYS MARCH DREW ON AND AFTERNOON WANED THE FOREST OPENED OUT AND THE TREES BECAME LARGER AND MORE SCATTERED GREAT ILEXES OF HUGE GIRTH STOOD DARK AND SOLEMN IN WIDE GLADES WITH HERE AND THERE AMONG THEM HOARY ASHTREES AND GIANT OAKS JUST PUTTING OUT THEIR BROWNGREEN BUDS ABOUT THEM LAY LONG LAUNDS OF GREEN GRASS DAPPLED WITH CELANDINE AND ANEMONES WHITE AND BLUE NOW FOLDED FOR SLEEP AND THERE WERE ACRES POPULOUS WITH THE LEAVES OF WOODLAND HYACINTHS ALREADY THEIR SLEEK BELLSTEMS WERE THRUSTING THROUGH THE MOULD NO LIVING CREATURE BEAST OR BIRD WAS TO BE SEEN BUT IN THESE OPEN PLACES GOLLUM GREW AFRAID AND THEY WALKED NOW WITH CAUTION FLITTING FROM ONE LONG SHADOW TO ANOTHER
LIGHT WAS FADING FAST WHEN THEY CAME TO THE FORESTEND THERE THEY SAT UNDER AN OLD GNARLED OAK THAT SENT ITS ROOTS TWISTING LIKE SNAKES DOWN A STEEP CRUMBLING BANK A DEEP DIM VALLEY LAY BEFORE THEM ON ITS FURTHER SIDE THE WOODS GATHERED AGAIN BLUE AND GREY UNDER THE SULLEN EVENING AND MARCHED ON SOUTHWARDS TO THE RIGHT THE MOUNTAINS OF GONDOR GLOWED REMOTE IN THE WEST UNDER A FIREFLECKED SKY TO THE LEFT LAY DARKNESS THE TOWERING WALLS OF MORDOR AND OUT OF THAT DARKNESS THE LONG VALLEY CAME FALLING STEEPLY IN AN EVERWIDENING TROUGH TOWARDS THE ANDUIN AT ITS BOTTOM RAN A HURRYING STREAM FRODO COULD HEAR ITS STONY VOICE COMING UP THROUGH THE SILENCE AND BESIDE IT ON THE HITHER SIDE A ROAD WENT WINDING DOWN LIKE A PALE RIBBON DOWN INTO CHILL GREY MISTS THAT NO GLEAM OF SUNSET TOUCHED THERE IT SEEMED TO FRODO THAT HE DESCRIED FAR OFF FLOATING AS IT WERE ON A SHADOWY SEA THE HIGH DIM TOPS AND BROKEN PINNACLES OF OLD TOWERS FORLORN AND DARK
HE TURNED TO GOLLUM DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE HE SAID
YES MASTER DANGEROUS PLACES THIS IS THE ROAD FROM THE TOWER OF THE MOON MASTER DOWN TO THE RUINED CITY BY THE SHORES OF THE RIVER THE RUINED CITY YES VERY NASTY PLACE FULL OF ENEMIES WE SHOULDNT HAVE TAKEN MENS ADVICE HOBBITS HAVE COME A LONG WAY OUT OF THE PATH MUST GO EAST NOW AWAY UP THERE HE WAVED HIS SKINNY ARM TOWARDS THE DARKLING MOUNTAINS AND WE CANT USE THIS ROAD OH NO CRUEL PEOPLES COME THIS WAY DOWN FROM THE TOWER
FRODO LOOKED DOWN ON TO THE ROAD AT ANY RATE NOTHING WAS MOVING ON IT NOW IT APPEARED LONELY AND FORSAKEN RUNNING DOWN TO EMPTY RUINS IN THE MIST BUT THERE WAS AN EVIL FEELING IN THE AIR AS IF THINGS MIGHT INDEED BE PASSING UP AND DOWN THAT EYES COULD NOT SEE FRODO SHUDDERED AS HE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE DISTANT PINNACLES NOW DWINDLING INTO NIGHT AND THE SOUND OF THE WATER SEEMED COLD AND CRUEL THE VOICE OF MORGULDUIN THE POLLUTED STREAM THAT FLOWED FROM THE VALLEY OF THE WRAITHS
WHAT SHALL WE DO HE SAID WE HAVE WALKED LONG AND FAR SHALL WE LOOK FOR SOME PLACE IN THE WOODS BEHIND WHERE WE CAN LIE HIDDEN
NO GOOD HIDING IN THE DARK SAID GOLLUM ITS IN DAY THAT HOBBITS MUST HIDE NOW YES IN DAY
OH COME SAID SAM WE MUST REST FOR A BIT EVEN IF WE GET UP AGAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERELL STILL BE HOURS OF DARK THEN TIME ENOUGH FOR YOU TO TAKE US A LONG MARCH IF YOU KNOW THE WAY
GOLLUM RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO THIS AND HE TURNED BACK TOWARDS THE TREES WORKING EASTWARD FOR A WHILE ALONG THE STRAGGLING EDGES OF THE WOOD HE WOULD NOT REST ON THE GROUND SO NEAR THE EVIL ROAD AND AFTER SOME DEBATE THEY ALL CLIMBED UP INTO THE CROTCH OF A LARGE HOLMOAK WHOSE THICK BRANCHES SPRINGING TOGETHER FROM THE TRUNK MADE A GOOD HIDINGPLACE AND A FAIRLY COMFORTABLE REFUGE NIGHT FELL AND IT GREW ALTOGETHER DARK UNDER THE CANOPY OF THE TREE FRODO AND SAM DRANK A LITTLE WATER AND ATE SOME BREAD AND DRIED FRUIT BUT GOLLUM AT ONCE CURLED UP AND WENT TO SLEEP THE HOBBITS DID NOT SHUT THEIR EYES
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN GOLLUM WOKE UP SUDDENLY THEY WERE AWARE OF HIS PALE EYES UNLIDDED GLEAMING AT THEM HE LISTENED AND SNIFFED WHICH SEEMED AS THEY HAD NOTICED BEFORE HIS USUAL METHOD OF DISCOVERING THE TIME OF NIGHT
ARE WE RESTED HAVE WE HAD BEAUTIFUL SLEEP HE SAID LETS GO
WE ARENT AND WE HAVENT GROWLED SAM BUT WELL GO IF WE MUST
GOLLUM DROPPED AT ONCE FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE ON TO ALL FOURS AND THE HOBBITS FOLLOWED MORE SLOWLY
AS SOON AS THEY WERE DOWN THEY WENT ON AGAIN WITH GOLLUM LEADING EASTWARDS UP THE DARK SLOPING LAND THEY COULD SEE LITTLE FOR THE NIGHT WAS NOW SO DEEP THAT THEY WERE HARDLY AWARE OF THE STEMS OF TREES BEFORE THEY STUMBLED AGAINST THEM THE GROUND BECAME MORE BROKEN AND WALKING WAS MORE DIFFICULT BUT GOLLUM SEEMED IN NO WAY TROUBLED HE LED THEM THROUGH THICKETS AND WASTES OF BRAMBLES SOMETIMES ROUND THE LIP OF A DEEP CLEFT OR DARK PIT SOMETIMES DOWN INTO BLACK BUSHSHROUDED HOLLOWS AND OUT AGAIN BUT IF EVER THEY WENT A LITTLE DOWNWARD ALWAYS THE FURTHER SLOPE WAS LONGER AND STEEPER THEY WERE CLIMBING STEADILY AT THEIR FIRST HALT THEY LOOKED BACK AND THEY COULD DIMLY PERCEIVE THE ROOFS OF THE FOREST THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND LYING LIKE A VAST DENSE SHADOW A DARKER NIGHT UNDER THE DARK BLANK SKY THERE SEEMED TO BE A GREAT BLACKNESS LOOMING SLOWLY OUT OF THE EAST EATING UP THE FAINT BLURRED STARS LATER THE SINKING MOON ESCAPED FROM THE PURSUING CLOUD BUT IT WAS RINGED ALL ABOUT WITH A SICKLY YELLOW GLARE
AT LAST GOLLUM TURNED TO THE HOBBITS DAY SOON HE SAID HOBBITS MUST HURRY NOT SAFE TO STAY IN THE OPEN IN THESE PLACES MAKE HASTE
HE QUICKENED HIS PACE AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM WEARILY SOON THEY BEGAN TO CLIMB UP ON TO A GREAT HOGBACK OF LAND FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS COVERED WITH A THICK GROWTH OF GORSE AND WHORTLEBERRY AND LOW TOUGH THORNS THOUGH HERE AND THERE CLEARINGS OPENED THE SCARS OF RECENT FIRES THE GORSEBUSHES BECAME MORE FREQUENT AS THEY GOT NEARER THE TOP VERY OLD AND TALL THEY WERE GAUNT AND LEGGY BELOW BUT THICK ABOVE AND ALREADY PUTTING OUT YELLOW FLOWERS THAT GLIMMERED IN THE GLOOM AND GAVE A FAINT SWEET SCENT SO TALL WERE THE SPINY THICKETS THAT THE HOBBITS COULD WALK UPRIGHT UNDER THEM PASSING THROUGH LONG DRY AISLES CARPETED WITH A DEEP PRICKLY MOULD
ON THE FURTHER EDGE OF THIS BROAD HILLBACK THEY STAYED THEIR MARCH AND CRAWLED FOR HIDING UNDERNEATH A TANGLED KNOT OF THORNS THEIR TWISTED BOUGHS STOOPING TO THE GROUND WERE OVERRIDDEN BY A CLAMBERING MAZE OF OLD BRIARS DEEP INSIDE THERE WAS A HOLLOW HALL RAFTERED WITH DEAD BRANCH AND BRAMBLE AND ROOFED WITH THE FIRST LEAVES AND SHOOTS OF SPRING THERE THEY LAY FOR A WHILE TOO TIRED YET TO EAT AND PEERING OUT THROUGH THE HOLES IN THE COVERT THEY WATCHED FOR THE SLOW GROWTH OF DAY
BUT NO DAY CAME ONLY A DEAD BROWN TWILIGHT IN THE EAST THERE WAS A DULL RED GLARE UNDER THE LOWERING CLOUD IT WAS NOT THE RED OF DAWN ACROSS THE TUMBLED LANDS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE EPHEL DUATH FROWNED AT THEM BLACK AND SHAPELESS BELOW WHERE NIGHT LAY THICK AND DID NOT PASS AWAY ABOVE WITH JAGGED TOPS AND EDGES OUTLINED HARD AND MENACING AGAINST THE FIERY GLOW AWAY TO THEIR RIGHT A GREAT SHOULDER OF THE MOUNTAINS STOOD OUT DARK AND BLACK AMID THE SHADOWS THRUSTING WESTWARD
WHICH WAY DO WE GO FROM HERE ASKED FRODO IS THAT THE OPENING OF  OF THE MORGUL VALLEY AWAY OVER THERE BEYOND THAT BLACK MASS
NEED WE THINK ABOUT IT YET SAID SAM SURELY WERE NOT GOING TO MOVE ANY MORE TODAY IF DAY IT IS
PERHAPS NOT PERHAPS NOT SAID GOLLUM BUT WE MUST GO SOON TO THE CROSSROADS YES TO THE CROSSROADS THATS THE WAY OVER THERE YES MASTER
THE RED GLARE OVER MORDOR DIED AWAY THE TWILIGHT DEEPENED AS GREAT VAPOURS ROSE IN THE EAST AND CRAWLED ABOVE THEM FRODO AND SAM TOOK A LITTLE FOOD AND THEN LAY DOWN BUT GOLLUM WAS RESTLESS HE WOULD NOT EAT ANY OF THEIR FOOD BUT HE DRANK A LITTLE WATER AND THEN CRAWLED ABOUT UNDER THE BUSHES SNIFFING AND MUTTERING THEN SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED
OFF HUNTING I SUPPOSE SAID SAM AND YAWNED IT WAS HIS TURN TO SLEEP FIRST AND HE WAS SOON DEEP IN A DREAM HE THOUGHT HE WAS BACK IN THE BAG END GARDEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BUT HE HAD A HEAVY PACK ON HIS BACK WHICH MADE HIM STOOP IT ALL SEEMED VERY WEEDY AND RANK SOMEHOW AND THORNS AND BRACKEN WERE INVADING THE BEDS DOWN NEAR THE BOTTOM HEDGE
A JOB OF WORK FOR ME I CAN SEE BUT IM SO TIRED HE KEPT ON SAYING PRESENTLY HE REMEMBERED WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR MY PIPE HE SAID AND WITH THAT HE WOKE UP
SILLY HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE OPENED HIS EYES AND WONDERED WHY HE WAS LYING DOWN UNDER THE HEDGE ITS IN YOUR PACK ALL THE TIME THEN HE REALIZED FIRST THAT THE PIPE MIGHT BE IN HIS PACK BUT HE HAD NO LEAF AND NEXT THAT HE WAS HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM BAG END HE SAT UP IT SEEMED TO BE ALMOST DARK WHY HAD HIS MASTER LET HIM SLEEP ON OUT OF TURN RIGHT ON TILL EVENING
HAVENT YOU HAD NO SLEEP MR FRODO HE SAID WHATS THE TIME SEEMS TO BE GETTING LATE
NO IT ISNT SAID FRODO BUT THE DAY IS GETTING DARKER INSTEAD OF LIGHTER DARKER AND DARKER AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT ISNT MIDDAY YET AND YOUVE ONLY SLEPT FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS
I WONDER WHATS UP SAID SAM IS THERE A STORM COMING IF SO ITS GOING TO BE THE WORST THERE EVER WAS WE SHALL WISH WE WERE DOWN A DEEP HOLE NOT JUST STUCK UNDER A HEDGE HE LISTENED WHATS THAT THUNDER OR DRUMS OR WHAT IS IT
I DONT KNOW SAID FRODO ITS BEEN GOING ON FOR A GOOD WHILE NOW SOMETIMES THE GROUND SEEMS TO TREMBLE SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO BE THE HEAVY AIR THROBBING IN YOUR EARS
SAM LOOKED ROUND WHERES GOLLUM HE SAID HASNT HE COME BACK YET
NO SAID FRODO THERES NOT BEEN A SIGN OR SOUND OF HIM
WELL I CANT ABIDE HIM SAID SAM IN FACT IVE NEVER TAKEN ANYTHING ON A JOURNEY THAT ID HAVE BEEN LESS SORRY TO LOSE ON THE WAY BUT IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE HIM AFTER COMING ALL THESE MILES TO GO AND GET LOST NOW JUST WHEN WE SHALL NEED HIM MOST  THAT IS IF HES EVER GOING TO BE ANY USE WHICH I DOUBT
YOU FORGET THE MARSHES SAID FRODO I HOPE NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
AND I HOPE HES UP TO NO TRICKS AND ANYWAY I HOPE HE DOESNT FALL INTO OTHER HANDS AS YOU MIGHT SAY BECAUSE IF HE DOES WE SHALL SOON BE IN FOR TROUBLE
AT THAT MOMENT A ROLLING AND RUMBLING NOISE WAS HEARD AGAIN LOUDER NOW AND DEEPER THE GROUND SEEMED TO QUIVER UNDER THEIR FEET I THINK WE ARE IN FOR TROUBLE ANYHOW SAID FRODO IM AFRAID OUR JOURNEY IS DRAWING TO AN END
MAYBE SAID SAM BUT WHERE THERES LIFE THERES HOPE AS MY GAFFER USED TO SAY AND NEED OF VITTLES AS HE MOSTWAYS USED TO ADD YOU HAVE A BITE MR FRODO AND THEN A BIT OF SLEEP
THE AFTERNOON AS SAM SUPPOSED IT MUST BE CALLED WORE ON LOOKING OUT FROM THE COVERT HE COULD SEE ONLY A DUN SHADOWLESS WORLD FADING SLOWLY INTO A FEATURELESS COLOURLESS GLOOM IT FELT STIFLING BUT NOT WARM FRODO SLEPT UNQUIETLY TURNING AND TOSSING AND SOMETIMES MURMURING TWICE SAM THOUGHT HE HEARD HIM SPEAKING GANDALFS NAME THE TIME SEEMED TO DRAG INTERMINABLY SUDDENLY SAM HEARD A HISS BEHIND HIM AND THERE WAS GOLLUM ON ALL FOURS PEERING AT THEM WITH GLEAMING EYES
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP SLEEPIES HE WHISPERED WAKE UP NO TIME TO LOSE WE MUST GO YES WE MUST GO AT ONCE NO TIME TO LOSE
SAM STARED AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY HE SEEMED FRIGHTENED OR EXCITED GO NOW WHATS YOUR LITTLE GAME IT ISNT TIME YET IT CANT BE TEATIME EVEN LEASTWAYS NOT IN DECENT PLACES WHERE THERE IS TEATIME
SILLY HISSED GOLLUM WERE NOT IN DECENT PLACES TIMES RUNNING SHORT YES RUNNING FAST NO TIME TO LOSE WE MUST GO WAKE UP MASTER WAKE UP HE CLAWED AT FRODO AND FRODO STARTLED OUT OF SLEEP SAT UP SUDDENLY AND SEIZED HIM BY THE ARM GOLLUM TORE HIMSELF LOOSE AND BACKED AWAY
THEY MUSTNT BE SILLY HE HISSED WE MUST GO NO TIME TO LOSE AND NOTHING MORE COULD THEY GET OUT OF HIM WHERE HE HAD BEEN AND WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS BREWING TO MAKE HIM IN SUCH A HURRY HE WOULD NOT SAY SAM WAS FILLED WITH DEEP SUSPICION AND SHOWED IT BUT FRODO GAVE NO SIGN OF WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS MIND HE SIGHED HOISTED HIS PACK AND PREPARED TO GO OUT INTO THE EVERGATHERING DARKNESS
VERY STEALTHILY GOLLUM LED THEM DOWN THE HILLSIDE KEEPING UNDER COVER WHEREVER IT WAS POSSIBLE AND RUNNING ALMOST BENT TO THE GROUND ACROSS ANY OPEN SPACE BUT THE LIGHT WAS NOW SO DIM THAT EVEN A KEENEYED BEAST OF THE WILD COULD SCARCELY HAVE SEEN THE HOBBITS HOODED IN THEIR GREY CLOAKS NOR HEARD THEM WALKING AS WARILY AS THE LITTLE PEOPLE CAN WITHOUT THE CRACK OF A TWIG OR THE RUSTLE OF A LEAF THEY PASSED AND VANISHED
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THEY WENT ON SILENTLY IN SINGLE FILE OPPRESSED BY THE GLOOM AND BY THE ABSOLUTE STILLNESS OF THE LAND BROKEN ONLY NOW AND AGAIN BY THE FAINT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER FAR AWAY OR DRUMBEATS IN SOME HOLLOW OF THE HILLS DOWN FROM THEIR HIDINGPLACE THEY WENT AND THEN TURNING SOUTH THEY STEERED AS STRAIGHT A COURSE AS GOLLUM COULD FIND ACROSS A LONG BROKEN SLOPE THAT LEANED UP TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS PRESENTLY NOT FAR AHEAD LOOMING UP LIKE A BLACK WALL THEY SAW A BELT OF TREES AS THEY DREW NEARER THEY BECAME AWARE THAT THESE WERE OF VAST SIZE VERY ANCIENT IT SEEMED AND STILL TOWERING HIGH THOUGH THEIR TOPS WERE GAUNT AND BROKEN AS IF TEMPEST AND LIGHTNINGBLAST HAD SWEPT ACROSS THEM BUT HAD FAILED TO KILL THEM OR TO SHAKE THEIR FATHOMLESS ROOTS
THE CROSSROADS YES WHISPERED GOLLUM THE FIRST WORDS THAT HAD BEEN SPOKEN SINCE THEY LEFT THEIR HIDINGPLACE WE MUST GO THAT WAY TURNING EASTWARD NOW HE LED THEM UP THE SLOPE AND THEN SUDDENLY THERE IT WAS BEFORE THEM THE SOUTHWARD ROAD WINDING ITS WAY ABOUT THE OUTER FEET OF THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL PRESENTLY IT PLUNGED INTO THE GREAT RING OF TREES
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WHISPERED GOLLUM NO PATHS BEYOND THE ROAD NO PATHS WE MUST GO TO THE CROSSROADS BUT MAKE HASTE BE SILENT
AS FURTIVELY AS SCOUTS WITHIN THE CAMPMENT OF THEIR ENEMIES THEY CREPT DOWN ON TO THE ROAD AND STOLE ALONG ITS WESTWARD EDGE UNDER THE STONY BANK GREY AS THE STONES THEMSELVES AND SOFTFOOTED AS HUNTING CATS AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE TREES AND FOUND THAT THEY STOOD IN A GREAT ROOFLESS RING OPEN IN THE MIDDLE TO THE SOMBRE SKY AND THE SPACES BETWEEN THEIR IMMENSE BOLES WERE LIKE THE GREAT DARK ARCHES OF SOME RUINED HALL IN THE VERY CENTRE FOUR WAYS MET BEHIND THEM LAY THE ROAD TO THE MORANNON BEFORE THEM IT RAN OUT AGAIN UPON ITS LONG JOURNEY SOUTH TO THEIR RIGHT THE ROAD FROM OLD OSGILIATH CAME CLIMBING UP AND CROSSING PASSED OUT EASTWARD INTO DARKNESS THE FOURTH WAY THE ROAD THEY WERE TO TAKE
STANDING THERE FOR A MOMENT FILLED WITH DREAD FRODO BECAME AWARE THAT A LIGHT WAS SHINING HE SAW IT GLOWING ON SAMS FACE BESIDE HIM TURNING TOWARDS IT HE SAW BEYOND AN ARCH OF BOUGHS THE ROAD TO OSGILIATH RUNNING ALMOST AS STRAIGHT AS A STRETCHED RIBBON DOWN DOWN INTO THE WEST THERE FAR AWAY BEYOND SAD GONDOR NOW OVERWHELMED IN SHADE THE SUN WAS SINKING FINDING AT LAST THE HEM OF THE GREAT SLOWROLLING PALL OF CLOUD AND FALLING IN AN OMINOUS FIRE TOWARDS THE YET UNSULLIED SEA THE BRIEF GLOW FELL UPON A HUGE SITTING FIGURE STILL AND SOLEMN AS THE GREAT STONE KINGS OF ARGONATH THE YEARS HAD GNAWED IT AND VIOLENT HANDS HAD MAIMED IT ITS HEAD WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE WAS SET IN MOCKERY A ROUND ROUGHHEWN STONE RUDELY PAINTED BY SAVAGE HANDS IN THE LIKENESS OF A GRINNING FACE WITH ONE LARGE RED EYE IN THE MIDST OF ITS FOREHEAD UPON ITS KNEES AND MIGHTY CHAIR AND ALL ABOUT THE PEDESTAL WERE IDLE SCRAWLS MIXED WITH THE FOUL SYMBOLS THAT THE MAGGOTFOLK OF MORDOR USED
SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY THE LEVEL BEAMS FRODO SAW THE OLD KINGS HEAD IT WAS LYING ROLLED AWAY BY THE ROADSIDE LOOK SAM HE CRIED STARTLED INTO SPEECH LOOK THE KING HAS GOT A CROWN AGAIN
THE EYES WERE HOLLOW AND THE CARVEN BEARD WAS BROKEN BUT ABOUT THE HIGH STERN FOREHEAD THERE WAS A CORONAL OF SILVER AND GOLD A TRAILING PLANT WITH FLOWERS LIKE SMALL WHITE STARS HAD BOUND ITSELF ACROSS THE BROWS AS IF IN REVERENCE FOR THE FALLEN KING AND IN THE CREVICES OF HIS STONY HAIR YELLOW STONECROP GLEAMED
THEY CANNOT CONQUER FOR EVER SAID FRODO AND THEN SUDDENLY THE BRIEF GLIMPSE WAS GONE THE SUN DIPPED AND VANISHED AND AS IF AT THE SHUTTERING OF A LAMP BLACK NIGHT FELL



CHAPTER 8
THE STAIRS OF CIRITH UNGOL

GOLLUM WAS TUGGING AT FRODOS CLOAK AND HISSING WITH FEAR AND IMPATIENCE WE MUST GO HE SAID WE MUSTNT STAND HERE MAKE HASTE
RELUCTANTLY FRODO TURNED HIS BACK ON THE WEST AND FOLLOWED AS HIS GUIDE LED HIM OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE EAST THEY LEFT THE RING OF TREES AND CREPT ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS THIS ROAD TOO RAN STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE BUT SOON IT BEGAN TO BEND AWAY SOUTHWARDS UNTIL IT CAME RIGHT UNDER THE GREAT SHOULDER OF ROCK THAT THEY HAD SEEN FROM THE DISTANCE BLACK AND FORBIDDING IT LOOMED ABOVE THEM DARKER THAN THE DARK SKY BEHIND CRAWLING UNDER ITS SHADOW THE ROAD WENT ON AND ROUNDING IT SPRANG EAST AGAIN AND BEGAN TO CLIMB STEEPLY
FRODO AND SAM WERE PLODDING ALONG WITH HEAVY HEARTS NO LONGER ABLE TO CARE GREATLY ABOUT THEIR PERIL FRODOS HEAD WAS BOWED HIS BURDEN WAS DRAGGING HIM DOWN AGAIN AS SOON AS THE GREAT CROSSROADS HAD BEEN PASSED THE WEIGHT OF IT ALMOST FORGOTTEN IN ITHILIEN HAD BEGUN TO GROW ONCE MORE NOW FEELING THE WAY BECOME STEEP BEFORE HIS FEET HE LOOKED WEARILY UP AND THEN HE SAW IT EVEN AS GOLLUM HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD THE CITY OF THE RINGWRAITHS HE COWERED AGAINST THE STONY BANK
A LONGTILTED VALLEY A DEEP GULF OF SHADOW RAN BACK FAR INTO THE MOUNTAINS UPON THE FURTHER SIDE SOME WAY WITHIN THE VALLEYS ARMS HIGH ON A ROCKY SEAT UPON THE BLACK KNEES OF THE EPHEL DUATH STOOD THE WALLS AND TOWER OF MINAS MORGUL ALL WAS DARK ABOUT IT EARTH AND SKY BUT IT WAS LIT WITH LIGHT NOT THE IMPRISONED MOONLIGHT WELLING THROUGH THE MARBLE WALLS OF MINAS ITHIL LONG AGO TOWER OF THE MOON FAIR AND RADIANT IN THE HOLLOW OF THE HILLS PALER INDEED THAN THE MOON AILING IN SOME SLOW ECLIPSE WAS THE LIGHT OF IT NOW WAVERING AND BLOWING LIKE A NOISOME EXHALATION OF DECAY A CORPSELIGHT A LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATED NOTHING IN THE WALLS AND TOWER WINDOWS SHOWED LIKE COUNTLESS BLACK HOLES LOOKING INWARD INTO EMPTINESS BUT THE TOPMOST COURSE OF THE TOWER REVOLVED SLOWLY FIRST ONE WAY AND THEN ANOTHER A HUGE GHOSTLY HEAD LEERING INTO THE NIGHT FOR A MOMENT THE THREE COMPANIONS STOOD THERE SHRINKING STARING UP WITH UNWILLING EYES GOLLUM WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER AGAIN HE PULLED AT THEIR CLOAKS URGENTLY BUT HE SPOKE NO WORD ALMOST HE DRAGGED THEM FORWARD EVERY STEP WAS RELUCTANT AND TIME SEEMED TO SLOW ITS PACE SO THAT BETWEEN THE RAISING OF A FOOT AND THE SETTING OF IT DOWN MINUTES OF LOATHING PASSED
SO THEY CAME SLOWLY TO THE WHITE BRIDGE HERE THE ROAD GLEAMING FAINTLY PASSED OVER THE STREAM IN THE MIDST OF THE VALLEY AND WENT ON WINDING DEVIOUSLY UP TOWARDS THE CITYS GATE A BLACK MOUTH OPENING IN THE OUTER CIRCLE OF THE NORTHWARD WALLS WIDE FLATS LAY ON EITHER BANK SHADOWY MEADS FILLED WITH PALE WHITE FLOWERS LUMINOUS THESE WERE TOO BEAUTIFUL AND YET HORRIBLE OF SHAPE LIKE THE DEMENTED FORMS IN AN UNEASY DREAM AND THEY GAVE FORTH A FAINT SICKENING CHARNELSMELL AN ODOUR OF ROTTENNESS FILLED THE AIR FROM MEAD TO MEAD THE BRIDGE SPRANG FIGURES STOOD THERE AT ITS HEAD CARVEN WITH CUNNING IN FORMS HUMAN AND BESTIAL BUT ALL CORRUPT AND LOATHSOME THE WATER FLOWING BENEATH WAS SILENT AND IT STEAMED BUT THE VAPOUR THAT ROSE FROM IT CURLING AND TWISTING ABOUT THE BRIDGE WAS DEADLY COLD FRODO FELT HIS SENSES REELING AND HIS MIND DARKENING THEN SUDDENLY AS IF SOME FORCE WERE AT WORK OTHER THAN HIS OWN WILL HE BEGAN TO HURRY TOTTERING FORWARD HIS GROPING HANDS HELD OUT HIS HEAD LOLLING FROM SIDE TO SIDE BOTH SAM AND GOLLUM RAN AFTER HIM SAM CAUGHT HIS MASTER IN HIS ARMS AS HE STUMBLED AND ALMOST FELL RIGHT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE BRIDGE
NOT THAT WAY NO NOT THAT WAY WHISPERED GOLLUM BUT THE BREATH BETWEEN HIS TEETH SEEMED TO TEAR THE HEAVY STILLNESS LIKE A WHISTLE AND HE COWERED TO THE GROUND IN TERROR
HOLD UP MR FRODO MUTTERED SAM IN FRODOS EAR COME BACK NOT THAT WAY GOLLUM SAYS NOT AND FOR ONCE I AGREE WITH HIM
FRODO PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS BROW AND WRENCHED HIS EYES AWAY FROM THE CITY ON THE HILL THE LUMINOUS TOWER FASCINATED HIM AND HE FOUGHT THE DESIRE THAT WAS ON HIM TO RUN UP THE GLEAMING ROAD TOWARDS ITS GATE AT LAST WITH AN EFFORT HE TURNED BACK AND AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE RING RESISTING HIM DRAGGING AT THE CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK AND HIS EYES TOO AS HE LOOKED AWAY SEEMED FOR THE MOMENT TO HAVE BEEN BLINDED THE DARKNESS BEFORE HIM WAS IMPENETRABLE
GOLLUM CRAWLING ON THE GROUND LIKE A FRIGHTENED ANIMAL WAS ALREADY VANISHING INTO THE GLOOM SAM SUPPORTING AND GUIDING HIS STUMBLING MASTER FOLLOWED AFTER HIM AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD NOT FAR FROM THE NEAR BANK OF THE STREAM THERE WAS A GAP IN THE STONEWALL BESIDE THE ROAD THROUGH THIS THEY PASSED AND SAM SAW THAT THEY WERE ON A NARROW PATH THAT GLEAMED FAINTLY AT FIRST AS THE MAIN ROAD DID UNTIL CLIMBING ABOVE THE MEADS OF DEADLY FLOWERS IT FADED AND WENT DARK WINDING ITS CROOKED WAY UP INTO THE NORTHERN SIDES OF THE VALLEY
ALONG THIS PATH THE HOBBITS TRUDGED SIDE BY SIDE UNABLE TO SEE GOLLUM IN FRONT OF THEM EXCEPT WHEN HE TURNED BACK TO BECKON THEM ON THEN HIS EYES SHONE WITH A GREENWHITE LIGHT REFLECTING THE NOISOME MORGULSHEEN PERHAPS OR KINDLED BY SOME ANSWERING MOOD WITHIN OF THAT DEADLY GLEAM AND OF THE DARK EYEHOLES FRODO AND SAM WERE ALWAYS CONSCIOUS EVER GLANCING FEARFULLY OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND EVER DRAGGING THEIR EYES BACK TO FIND THE DARKENING PATH SLOWLY THEY LABOURED ON AS THEY ROSE ABOVE THE STENCH AND VAPOURS OF THE POISONOUS STREAM THEIR BREATH BECAME EASIER AND THEIR HEADS CLEARER BUT NOW THEIR LIMBS WERE DEADLY TIRED AS IF THEY HAD WALKED ALL NIGHT UNDER A BURDEN OR HAD BEEN SWIMMING LONG AGAINST A HEAVY TIDE OF WATER AT LAST THEY COULD GO NO FURTHER WITHOUT A HALT
FRODO STOPPED AND SAT DOWN ON A STONE THEY HAD NOW CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP OF A GREAT HUMP OF BARE ROCK AHEAD OF THEM THERE WAS A BAY IN THE VALLEYSIDE AND ROUND THE HEAD OF THIS THE PATH WENT ON NO MORE THAN A WIDE LEDGE WITH A CHASM ON THE RIGHT ACROSS THE SHEER SOUTHWARD FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN IT CRAWLED UPWARDS UNTIL IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE BLACKNESS ABOVE
I MUST REST A WHILE SAM WHISPERED FRODO ITS HEAVY ON ME SAM LAD VERY HEAVY I WONDER HOW FAR I CAN CARRY IT ANYWAY I MUST REST BEFORE WE VENTURE ON TO THAT HE POINTED TO THE NARROW WAY AHEAD
SSSH SSH HISSED GOLLUM HURRYING BACK TO THEM SSSH HIS FINGERS WERE ON HIS LIPS AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD URGENTLY TUGGING AT FRODOS SLEEVE HE POINTED TOWARDS THE PATH BUT FRODO WOULD NOT MOVE
NOT YET HE SAID NOT YET WEARINESS AND MORE THAN WEARINESS OPPRESSED HIM IT SEEMED AS IF A HEAVY SPELL WAS LAID ON HIS MIND AND BODY I MUST REST HE MUTTERED
AT THIS GOLLUMS FEAR AND AGITATION BECAME SO GREAT THAT HE SPOKE AGAIN HISSING BEHIND HIS HAND AS IF TO KEEP THE SOUND FROM UNSEEN LISTENERS IN THE AIR NOT HERE NO NOT REST HERE FOOLS EYES CAN SEE US WHEN THEY COME TO THE BRIDGE THEY WILL SEE US COME AWAY CLIMB CLIMB COME
COME MR FRODO SAID SAM HES RIGHT AGAIN WE CANT STAY HERE
ALL RIGHT SAID FRODO IN A REMOTE VOICE AS OF ONE SPEAKING HALF ASLEEP I WILL TRY WEARILY HE GOT TO HIS FEET
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE AT THAT MOMENT THE ROCK QUIVERED AND TREMBLED BENEATH THEM THE GREAT RUMBLING NOISE LOUDER THAN EVER BEFORE ROLLED IN THE GROUND AND ECHOED IN THE MOUNTAINS THEN WITH SEARING SUDDENNESS THERE CAME A GREAT RED FLASH FAR BEYOND THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS IT LEAPT INTO THE SKY AND SPLASHED THE LOWERING CLOUDS WITH CRIMSON IN THAT VALLEY OF SHADOW AND COLD DEATHLY LIGHT IT SEEMED UNBEARABLY VIOLENT AND FIERCE PEAKS OF STONE AND RIDGES LIKE NOTCHED KNIVES SPRANG OUT IN STARING BLACK AGAINST THE UPRUSHING FLAME IN GORGOROTH THEN CAME A GREAT CRACK OF THUNDER
AND MINAS MORGUL ANSWERED THERE WAS A FLARE OF LIVID LIGHTNINGS FORKS OF BLUE FLAME SPRINGING UP FROM THE TOWER AND FROM THE ENCIRCLING HILLS INTO THE SULLEN CLOUDS THE EARTH GROANED AND OUT OF THE CITY THERE CAME A CRY MINGLED WITH HARSH HIGH VOICES AS OF BIRDS OF PREY AND THE SHRILL NEIGHING OF HORSES WILD WITH RAGE AND FEAR THERE CAME A RENDING SCREECH SHIVERING RISING SWIFTLY TO A PIERCING PITCH BEYOND THE RANGE OF HEARING THE HOBBITS WHEELED ROUND TOWARDS IT AND CAST THEMSELVES DOWN HOLDING THEIR HANDS UPON THEIR EARS
AS THE TERRIBLE CRY ENDED FALLING BACK THROUGH A LONG SICKENING WAIL TO SILENCE FRODO SLOWLY RAISED HIS HEAD ACROSS THE NARROW VALLEY NOW ALMOST ON A LEVEL WITH HIS EYES THE WALLS OF THE EVIL CITY STOOD AND ITS CAVERNOUS GATE SHAPED LIKE AN OPEN MOUTH WITH GLEAMING TEETH WAS GAPING WIDE AND OUT OF THE GATE AN ARMY CAME
ALL THAT HOST WAS CLAD IN SABLE DARK AS THE NIGHT AGAINST THE WAN WALLS AND THE LUMINOUS PAVEMENT OF THE ROAD FRODO COULD SEE THEM SMALL BLACK FIGURES IN RANK UPON RANK MARCHING SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY PASSING OUTWARDS IN AN ENDLESS STREAM BEFORE THEM WENT A GREAT CAVALRY OF HORSEMEN MOVING LIKE ORDERED SHADOWS AND AT THEIR HEAD WAS ONE GREATER THAN ALL THE REST A RIDER ALL BLACK SAVE THAT ON HIS HOODED HEAD HE HAD A HELM LIKE A CROWN THAT FLICKERED WITH A PERILOUS LIGHT NOW HE WAS DRAWING NEAR THE BRIDGE BELOW AND FRODOS STARING EYES FOLLOWED HIM UNABLE TO WINK OR TO WITHDRAW SURELY THERE WAS THE LORD OF THE NINE RIDERS RETURNED TO EARTH TO LEAD HIS GHASTLY HOST TO BATTLE HERE YES HERE INDEED WAS THE HAGGARD KING WHOSE COLD HAND HAD SMITTEN DOWN THE RINGBEARER WITH HIS DEADLY KNIFE THE OLD WOUND THROBBED WITH PAIN AND A GREAT CHILL SPREAD TOWARDS FRODOS HEART
EVEN AS THESE THOUGHTS PIERCED HIM WITH DREAD AND HELD HIM BOUND AS WITH A SPELL THE RIDER HALTED SUDDENLY RIGHT BEFORE THE ENTRANCE OF THE BRIDGE AND BEHIND HIM ALL THE HOST STOOD STILL THERE WAS A PAUSE A DEAD SILENCE MAYBE IT WAS THE RING THAT CALLED TO THE WRAITHLORD AND FOR A MOMENT HE WAS TROUBLED SENSING SOME OTHER POWER WITHIN HIS VALLEY THIS WAY AND THAT TURNED THE DARK HEAD HELMED AND CROWNED WITH FEAR SWEEPING THE SHADOWS WITH ITS UNSEEN EYES FRODO WAITED LIKE A BIRD AT THE APPROACH OF A SNAKE UNABLE TO MOVE AND AS HE WAITED HE FELT MORE URGENT THAN EVER BEFORE THE COMMAND THAT HE SHOULD PUT ON THE RING BUT GREAT AS THE PRESSURE WAS HE FELT NO INCLINATION NOW TO YIELD TO IT HE KNEW THAT THE RING WOULD ONLY BETRAY HIM AND THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN IF HE PUT IT ON THE POWER TO FACE THE MORGULKING  NOT YET THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ANSWER TO THAT COMMAND IN HIS OWN WILL DISMAYED BY TERROR THOUGH IT WAS AND HE FELT ONLY THE BEATING UPON HIM OF A GREAT POWER FROM OUTSIDE IT TOOK HIS HAND AND AS FRODO WATCHED WITH HIS MIND NOT WILLING IT BUT IN SUSPENSE AS IF HE LOOKED ON SOME OLD STORY FAR AWAY IT MOVED THE HAND INCH BY INCH TOWARDS THE CHAIN UPON HIS NECK THEN HIS OWN WILL STIRRED SLOWLY IT FORCED THE HAND BACK AND SET IT TO FIND ANOTHER THING A THING LYING HIDDEN NEAR HIS BREAST COLD AND HARD IT SEEMED AS HIS GRIP CLOSED ON IT THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL SO LONG TREASURED AND ALMOST FORGOTTEN TILL THAT HOUR AS HE TOUCHED IT FOR A WHILE ALL THOUGHT OF THE RING WAS BANISHED FROM HIS MIND HE SIGHED AND BENT HIS HEAD
AT THAT MOMENT THE WRAITHKING TURNED AND SPURRED HIS HORSE AND RODE ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND ALL HIS DARK HOST FOLLOWED HIM MAYBE THE ELVENHOODS DEFIED HIS UNSEEN EYES AND THE MIND OF HIS SMALL ENEMY BEING STRENGTHENED HAD TURNED ASIDE HIS THOUGHT BUT HE WAS IN HASTE ALREADY THE HOUR HAD STRUCK AND AT HIS GREAT MASTERS BIDDING HE MUST MARCH WITH WAR INTO THE WEST
SOON HE HAD PASSED LIKE A SHADOW INTO SHADOW DOWN THE WINDING ROAD AND BEHIND HIM STILL THE BLACK RANKS CROSSED THE BRIDGE SO GREAT AN ARMY HAD NEVER ISSUED FROM THAT VALE SINCE THE DAYS OF ISILDURS MIGHT NO HOST SO FELL AND STRONG IN ARMS HAD YET ASSAILED THE FORDS OF ANDUIN AND YET IT WAS BUT ONE AND NOT THE GREATEST OF THE HOSTS THAT MORDOR NOW SENT FORTH
FRODO STIRRED AND SUDDENLY HIS HEART WENT OUT TO FARAMIR THE STORM HAS BURST AT LAST HE THOUGHT THIS GREAT ARRAY OF SPEARS AND SWORDS IS GOING TO OSGILIATH WILL FARAMIR GET ACROSS IN TIME HE GUESSED IT BUT DID HE KNOW THE HOUR AND WHO CAN NOW HOLD THE FORDS WHEN THE KING OF THE NINE RIDERS COMES AND OTHER ARMIES WILL COME I AM TOO LATE ALL IS LOST I TARRIED ON THE WAY ALL IS LOST EVEN IF MY ERRAND IS PERFORMED NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW THERE WILL BE NO ONE I CAN TELL IT WILL BE IN VAIN OVERCOME WITH WEAKNESS HE WEPT AND STILL THE HOST OF MORGUL CROSSED THE BRIDGE
THEN AT A GREAT DISTANCE AS IF IT CAME OUT OF MEMORIES OF THE SHIRE SOME SUNLIT EARLY MORNING WHEN THE DAY CALLED AND DOORS WERE OPENING HE HEARD SAMS VOICE SPEAKING WAKE UP MR FRODO WAKE UP HAD THE VOICE ADDED YOUR BREAKFAST IS READY HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED CERTAINLY SAM WAS URGENT WAKE UP MR FRODO THEYRE GONE HE SAID
THERE WAS A DULL CLANG THE GATES OF MINAS MORGUL HAD CLOSED THE LAST RANK OF SPEARS HAD VANISHED DOWN THE ROAD THE TOWER STILL GRINNED ACROSS THE VALLEY BUT THE LIGHT WAS FADING IN IT THE WHOLE CITY WAS FALLING BACK INTO A DARK BROODING SHADE AND SILENCE YET STILL IT WAS FILLED WITH WATCHFULNESS
WAKE UP MR FRODO THEYRE GONE AND WED BETTER GO TOO THERES SOMETHING STILL ALIVE IN THAT PLACE SOMETHING WITH EYES OR A SEEING MIND IF YOU TAKE ME AND THE LONGER WE STAY IN ONE SPOT THE SOONER IT WILL GET ON TO US COME ON MR FRODO
FRODO RAISED HIS HEAD AND THEN STOOD UP DESPAIR HAD NOT LEFT HIM BUT THE WEAKNESS HAD PASSED HE EVEN SMILED GRIMLY FEELING NOW AS CLEARLY AS A MOMENT BEFORE HE HAD FELT THE OPPOSITE THAT WHAT HE HAD TO DO HE HAD TO DO IF HE COULD AND THAT WHETHER FARAMIR OR ARAGORN OR ELROND OR GALADRIEL OR GANDALF OR ANYONE ELSE EVER KNEW ABOUT IT WAS BESIDE THE PURPOSE HE TOOK HIS STAFF IN ONE HAND AND THE PHIAL IN HIS OTHER WHEN HE SAW THAT THE CLEAR LIGHT WAS ALREADY WELLING THROUGH HIS FINGERS HE THRUST IT INTO HIS BOSOM AND HELD IT AGAINST HIS HEART THEN TURNING FROM THE CITY OF MORGUL NOW NO MORE THAN A GREY GLIMMER ACROSS A DARK GULF HE PREPARED TO TAKE THE UPWARD ROAD
GOLLUM IT SEEMED HAD CRAWLED OFF ALONG THE LEDGE INTO THE DARKNESS BEYOND WHEN THE GATES OF MINAS MORGUL OPENED LEAVING THE HOBBITS WHERE THEY LAY HE NOW CAME CREEPING BACK HIS TEETH CHATTERING AND HIS FINGERS SNAPPING FOOLISH SILLY HE HISSED MAKE HASTE THEY MUSTNT THINK DANGER HAS PASSED IT HASNT MAKE HASTE
THEY DID NOT ANSWER BUT THEY FOLLOWED HIM ON TO THE CLIMBING LEDGE IT WAS LITTLE TO THE LIKING OF EITHER OF THEM NOT EVEN AFTER FACING SO MANY OTHER PERILS BUT IT DID NOT LAST LONG SOON THE PATH REACHED A ROUNDED ANGLE WHERE THE MOUNTAINSIDE SWELLED OUT AGAIN AND THERE IT SUDDENLY ENTERED A NARROW OPENING IN THE ROCK THEY HAD COME TO THE FIRST STAIR THAT GOLLUM HAD SPOKEN OF THE DARKNESS WAS ALMOST COMPLETE AND THEY COULD SEE NOTHING MUCH BEYOND THEIR HANDS STRETCH BUT GOLLUMS EYES SHONE PALE SEVERAL FEET ABOVE AS HE TURNED BACK TOWARDS THEM
CAREFUL HE WHISPERED STEPS LOTS OF STEPS MUST BE CAREFUL
CARE WAS CERTAINLY NEEDED FRODO AND SAM AT FIRST FELT EASIER HAVING NOW A WALL ON EITHER SIDE BUT THE STAIRWAY WAS ALMOST AS STEEP AS A LADDER AND AS THEY CLIMBED UP AND UP THEY BECAME MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THE LONG BLACK FALL BEHIND THEM AND THE STEPS WERE NARROW SPACED UNEVENLY AND OFTEN TREACHEROUS THEY WERE WORN AND SMOOTH AT THE EDGES AND SOME WERE BROKEN AND SOME CRACKED AS FOOT WAS SET UPON THEM THE HOBBITS STRUGGLED ON UNTIL AT LAST THEY WERE CLINGING WITH DESPERATE FINGERS TO THE STEPS AHEAD AND FORCING THEIR ACHING KNEES TO BEND AND STRAIGHTEN AND EVER AS THE STAIR CUT ITS WAY DEEPER INTO THE SHEER MOUNTAIN THE ROCKY WALLS ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER ABOVE THEIR HEADS
AT LENGTH JUST AS THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD ENDURE NO MORE THEY SAW GOLLUMS EYES PEERING DOWN AT THEM AGAIN WERE UP HE WHISPERED FIRST STAIRS PAST CLEVER HOBBITS TO CLIMB SO HIGH VERY CLEVER HOBBITS JUST A FEW MORE LITTLE STEPS AND THATS ALL YES
DIZZY AND VERY TIRED SAM AND FRODO FOLLOWING HIM CRAWLED UP THE LAST STEP AND SAT DOWN RUBBING THEIR LEGS AND KNEES THEY WERE IN A DEEP DARK PASSAGE THAT SEEMED STILL TO GO UP BEFORE THEM THOUGH AT A GENTLER SLOPE AND WITHOUT STEPS GOLLUM DID NOT LET THEM REST LONG
THERES ANOTHER STAIR STILL HE SAID MUCH LONGER STAIR REST WHEN WE GET TO THE TOP OF NEXT STAIR NOT YET
SAM GROANED LONGER DID YOU SAY HE ASKED
YES YESS LONGER SAID GOLLUM BUT NOT SO DIFFICULT HOBBITS HAVE CLIMBED THE STRAIGHT STAIR NEXT COMES THE WINDING STAIR
AND WHAT AFTER THAT SAID SAM
WE SHALL SEE SAID GOLLUM SOFTLY O YES WE SHALL SEE
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THERE WAS A TUNNEL SAID SAM ISNT THERE A TUNNEL OR SOMETHING TO GO THROUGH
O YES THERES A TUNNEL SAID GOLLUM BUT HOBBITS CAN REST BEFORE THEY TRY THAT IF THEY GET THROUGH THAT THEYLL BE NEARLY AT THE TOP VERY NEARLY IF THEY GET THROUGH O YES
FRODO SHIVERED THE CLIMB HAD MADE HIM SWEAT BUT NOW HE FELT COLD AND CLAMMY AND THERE WAS A CHILL DRAUGHT IN THE DARK PASSAGE BLOWING DOWN FROM THE INVISIBLE HEIGHTS ABOVE HE GOT UP AND SHOOK HIMSELF WELL LETS GO ON HE SAID THIS IS NO PLACE TO SIT IN
THE PASSAGE SEEMED TO GO ON FOR MILES AND ALWAYS THE CHILL AIR FLOWED OVER THEM RISING AS THEY WENT ON TO A BITTER WIND THE MOUNTAINS SEEMED TO BE TRYING WITH THEIR DEADLY BREATH TO DAUNT THEM TO TURN THEM BACK FROM THE SECRETS OF THE HIGH PLACES OR TO BLOW THEM AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEY ONLY KNEW THAT THEY HAD COME TO THE END WHEN SUDDENLY THEY FELT NO WALL AT THEIR RIGHT HAND THEY COULD SEE VERY LITTLE GREAT BLACK SHAPELESS MASSES AND DEEP GREY SHADOWS LOOMED ABOVE THEM AND ABOUT THEM BUT NOW AND AGAIN A DULL RED LIGHT FLICKERED UP UNDER THE LOWERING CLOUDS AND FOR A MOMENT THEY WERE AWARE OF TALL PEAKS IN FRONT AND ON EITHER SIDE LIKE PILLARS HOLDING UP A VAST SAGGING ROOF THEY SEEMED TO HAVE CLIMBED UP MANY HUNDREDS OF FEET ON TO A WIDE SHELF A CLIFF WAS ON THEIR LEFT AND A CHASM ON THEIR RIGHT
GOLLUM LED THE WAY CLOSE UNDER THE CLIFF FOR THE PRESENT THEY WERE NO LONGER CLIMBING BUT THE GROUND WAS NOW MORE BROKEN AND DANGEROUS IN THE DARK AND THERE WERE BLOCKS AND LUMPS OF FALLEN STONE IN THE WAY THEIR GOING WAS SLOW AND CAUTIOUS HOW MANY HOURS HAD PASSED SINCE THEY HAD ENTERED THE MORGUL VALE NEITHER SAM NOR FRODO COULD ANY LONGER GUESS THE NIGHT SEEMED ENDLESS
AT LENGTH THEY WERE ONCE MORE AWARE OF A WALL LOOMING UP AND ONCE MORE A STAIRWAY OPENED BEFORE THEM AGAIN THEY HALTED AND AGAIN THEY BEGAN TO CLIMB IT WAS A LONG AND WEARY ASCENT BUT THIS STAIRWAY DID NOT DELVE INTO THE MOUNTAINSIDE HERE THE HUGE CLIFF FACE SLOPED BACKWARDS AND THE PATH LIKE A SNAKE WOUND TO AND FRO ACROSS IT AT ONE POINT IT CRAWLED SIDEWAYS RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE DARK CHASM AND FRODO GLANCING DOWN SAW BELOW HIM AS A VAST DEEP PIT THE GREAT RAVINE AT THE HEAD OF THE MORGUL VALLEY DOWN IN ITS DEPTHS GLIMMERED LIKE A GLOWWORM THREAD THE WRAITHROAD FROM THE DEAD CITY TO THE NAMELESS PASS HE TURNED HASTILY AWAY
STILL ON AND UP THE STAIRWAY BENT AND CRAWLED UNTIL AT LAST WITH A FINAL FLIGHT SHORT AND STRAIGHT IT CLIMBED OUT AGAIN ON TO ANOTHER LEVEL THE PATH HAD VEERED AWAY FROM THE MAIN PASS IN THE GREAT RAVINE AND IT NOW FOLLOWED ITS OWN PERILOUS COURSE AT THE BOTTOM OF A LESSER CLEFT AMONG THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE EPHEL DUATH DIMLY THE HOBBITS COULD DISCERN TALL PIERS AND JAGGED PINNACLES OF STONE ON EITHER SIDE BETWEEN WHICH WERE GREAT CREVICES AND FISSURES BLACKER THAN THE NIGHT WHERE FORGOTTEN WINTERS HAD GNAWED AND CARVED THE SUNLESS STONE AND NOW THE RED LIGHT IN THE SKY SEEMED STRONGER THOUGH THEY COULD NOT TELL WHETHER A DREADFUL MORNING WERE INDEED COMING TO THIS PLACE OF SHADOW OR WHETHER THEY SAW ONLY THE FLAME OF SOME GREAT VIOLENCE OF SAURON IN THE TORMENT OF GORGOROTH BEYOND STILL FAR AHEAD AND STILL HIGH ABOVE FRODO LOOKING UP SAW AS HE GUESSED THE VERY CROWN OF THIS BITTER ROAD AGAINST THE SULLEN REDNESS OF THE EASTERN SKY A CLEFT WAS OUTLINED IN THE TOPMOST RIDGE NARROW DEEPCLOVEN BETWEEN TWO BLACK SHOULDERS AND ON EITHER SHOULDER WAS A HORN OF STONE
HE PAUSED AND LOOKED MORE ATTENTIVELY THE HORN UPON THE LEFT WAS TALL AND SLENDER AND IN IT BURNED A RED LIGHT OR ELSE THE RED LIGHT IN THE LAND BEYOND WAS SHINING THROUGH A HOLE HE SAW NOW IT WAS A BLACK TOWER POISED ABOVE THE OUTER PASS HE TOUCHED SAMS ARM AND POINTED
I DONT LIKE THE LOOK OF THAT SAID SAM SO THIS SECRET WAY OF YOURS IS GUARDED AFTER ALL HE GROWLED TURNING TO GOLLUM AS YOU KNEW ALL ALONG I SUPPOSE
ALL WAYS ARE WATCHED YES SAID GOLLUM OF COURSE THEY ARE BUT HOBBITS MUST TRY SOME WAY THIS MAY BE LEAST WATCHED PERHAPS THEYVE ALL GONE AWAY TO BIG BATTLE PERHAPS
PERHAPS GRUNTED SAM WELL IT STILL SEEMS A LONG WAY OFF AND A LONG WAY UP BEFORE WE GET THERE AND THERES STILL THE TUNNEL I THINK YOU OUGHT TO REST NOW MR FRODO I DONT KNOW WHAT TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT IT IS BUT WEVE KEPT GOING FOR HOURS AND HOURS
YES WE MUST REST SAID FRODO LET US FIND SOME CORNER OUT OF THE WIND AND GATHER OUR STRENGTH  FOR THE LAST LAP FOR SO HE FELT IT TO BE THE TERRORS OF THE LAND BEYOND AND THE DEED TO BE DONE THERE SEEMED REMOTE TOO FAR OFF YET TO TROUBLE HIM ALL HIS MIND WAS BENT ON GETTING THROUGH OR OVER THIS IMPENETRABLE WALL AND GUARD IF ONCE HE COULD DO THAT IMPOSSIBLE THING THEN SOMEHOW THE ERRAND WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED OR SO IT SEEMED TO HIM IN THAT DARK HOUR OF WEARINESS STILL LABOURING IN THE STONY SHADOWS UNDER CIRITH UNGOL
IN A DARK CREVICE BETWEEN TWO GREAT PIERS OF ROCK THEY SAT DOWN FRODO AND SAM A LITTLE WAY WITHIN AND GOLLUM CROUCHED UPON THE GROUND NEAR THE OPENING THERE THE HOBBITS TOOK WHAT THEY EXPECTED WOULD BE THEIR LAST MEAL BEFORE THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE NAMELESS LAND MAYBE THE LAST MEAL THEY WOULD EVER EAT TOGETHER SOME OF THE FOOD OF GONDOR THEY ATE AND WAFERS OF THE WAYBREAD OF THE ELVES AND THEY DRANK A LITTLE BUT OF THEIR WATER THEY WERE SPARING AND TOOK ONLY ENOUGH TO MOISTEN THEIR DRY MOUTHS

ITS SAYING A LOT TOO MUCH SAID FRODO AND HE LAUGHED A LONG CLEAR LAUGH FROM HIS HEART SUCH A SOUND HAD NOT BEEN HEARD IN THOSE PLACES SINCE SAURON CAME TO MIDDLEEARTH TO SAM SUDDENLY IT SEEMED AS IF ALL THE STONES WERE LISTENING AND THE TALL ROCKS LEANING OVER THEM BUT FRODO DID NOT HEED THEM HE LAUGHED AGAIN WHY SAM HE SAID TO HEAR YOU SOMEHOW MAKES ME AS MERRY AS IF THE STORY WAS ALREADY WRITTEN BUT YOUVE LEFT OUT ONE OF THE CHIEF CHARACTERS SAMWISE THE STOUTHEARTED I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT SAM DAD WHY DIDNT THEY PUT IN MORE OF HIS TALK DAD THATS WHAT I LIKE IT MAKES ME LAUGH AND FRODO WOULDNT HAVE GOT FAR WITHOUT SAM WOULD HE DAD 
NOW MR FRODO SAID SAM YOU SHOULDNT MAKE FUN I WAS SERIOUS
SO WAS I SAID FRODO AND SO I AM WERE GOING ON A BIT TOO FAST YOU AND I SAM ARE STILL STUCK IN THE WORST PLACES OF THE STORY AND IT IS ALL TOO LIKELY THAT SOME WILL SAY AT THIS POINT SHUT THE BOOK NOW DAD WE DONT WANT TO READ ANY MORE
MAYBE SAID SAM BUT I WOULDNT BE ONE TO SAY THAT THINGS DONE AND OVER AND MADE INTO PART OF THE GREAT TALES ARE DIFFERENT WHY EVEN GOLLUM MIGHT BE GOOD IN A TALE BETTER THAN HE IS TO HAVE BY YOU ANYWAY AND HE USED TO LIKE TALES HIMSELF ONCE BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT I WONDER IF HE THINKS HES THE HERO OR THE VILLAIN
GOLLUM HE CALLED WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE THE HERO  NOW WHERES HE GOT TO AGAIN
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM AT THE MOUTH OF THEIR SHELTER NOR IN THE SHADOWS NEAR HE HAD REFUSED THEIR FOOD THOUGH HE HAD AS USUAL ACCEPTED A MOUTHFUL OF WATER AND THEN HE HAD SEEMED TO CURL UP FOR A SLEEP THEY HAD SUPPOSED THAT ONE AT ANY RATE OF HIS OBJECTS IN HIS LONG ABSENCE THE DAY BEFORE HAD BEEN TO HUNT FOR FOOD TO HIS OWN LIKING AND NOW HE HAD EVIDENTLY SLIPPED OFF AGAIN WHILE THEY TALKED BUT WHAT FOR THIS TIME
I DONT LIKE HIS SNEAKING OFF WITHOUT SAYING SAID SAM AND LEAST OF ALL NOW HE CANT BE LOOKING FOR FOOD UP HERE NOT UNLESS THERES SOME KIND OF ROCK HE FANCIES WHY THERE ISNT EVEN A BIT OF MOSS
ITS NO GOOD WORRYING ABOUT HIM NOW SAID FRODO WE COULDNT HAVE GOT SO FAR NOT EVEN WITHIN SIGHT OF THE PASS WITHOUT HIM AND SO WELL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH HIS WAYS IF HES FALSE HES FALSE
ALL THE SAME ID RATHER HAVE HIM UNDER MY EYE SAID SAM ALL THE MORE SO IF HES FALSE DO YOU REMEMBER HE NEVER WOULD SAY IF THIS PASS WAS GUARDED OR NO AND NOW WE SEE A TOWER THERE  AND IT MAY BE DESERTED AND IT MAY NOT DO YOU THINK HES GONE TO FETCH THEM ORCS OR WHATEVER THEY ARE
NO I DONT THINK SO ANSWERED FRODO EVEN IF HES UP TO SOME WICKEDNESS AND I SUPPOSE THATS NOT UNLIKELY I DONT THINK ITS THAT NOT TO FETCH ORCS OR ANY SERVANTS OF THE ENEMY WHY WAIT TILL NOW AND GO THROUGH ALL THE LABOUR OF THE CLIMB AND COME SO NEAR THE LAND HE FEARS HE COULD PROBABLY HAVE BETRAYED US TO ORCS MANY TIMES SINCE WE MET HIM NO IF ITS ANYTHING IT WILL BE SOME LITTLE PRIVATE TRICK OF HIS OWN  THAT HE THINKS IS QUITE SECRET
WELL I SUPPOSE YOURE RIGHT MR FRODO SAID SAM NOT THAT IT COMFORTS ME MIGHTILY I DONT MAKE NO MISTAKE I DONT DOUBT HED HAND ME OVER TO ORCS AS GLADLY AS KISS HIS HAND BUT I WAS FORGETTING  HIS PRECIOUS NO I SUPPOSE THE WHOLE TIME ITS BEEN THE PRECIOUS FOR POOR SMEAGOL THATS THE ONE IDEA IN ALL HIS LITTLE SCHEMES IF HE HAS ANY BUT HOW BRINGING US UP HERE WILL HELP HIM IN THAT IS MORE THAN I CAN GUESS
VERY LIKELY HE CANT GUESS HIMSELF SAID FRODO AND I DONT THINK HES GOT JUST ONE PLAIN SCHEME IN HIS MUDDLED HEAD I THINK HE REALLY IS IN PART TRYING TO SAVE THE PRECIOUS FROM THE ENEMY AS LONG AS HE CAN FOR THAT WOULD BE THE LAST DISASTER FOR HIMSELF TOO IF THE ENEMY GOT IT AND IN THE OTHER PART PERHAPS HES JUST BIDING HIS TIME AND WAITING ON CHANCE
YES SLINKER AND STINKER AS IVE SAID BEFORE SAID SAM BUT THE NEARER THEY GET TO THE ENEMYS LAND THE MORE LIKE STINKER SLINKER WILL GET MARK MY WORDS IF EVER WE GET TO THE PASS HE WONT LET US REALLY TAKE THE PRECIOUS THING OVER THE BORDER WITHOUT MAKING SOME KIND OF TROUBLE
WE HAVENT GOT THERE YET SAID FRODO

SLEEP SAID FRODO AND SIGHED AS IF OUT OF A DESERT HE HAD SEEN A MIRAGE OF COOL GREEN YES EVEN HERE I COULD SLEEP
SLEEP THEN MASTER LAY YOUR HEAD IN MY LAP
AND SO GOLLUM FOUND THEM HOURS LATER WHEN HE RETURNED CRAWLING AND CREEPING DOWN THE PATH OUT OF THE GLOOM AHEAD SAM SAT PROPPED AGAINST THE STONE HIS HEAD DROPPING SIDEWAYS AND HIS BREATHING HEAVY IN HIS LAP LAY FRODOS HEAD DROWNED DEEP IN SLEEP UPON HIS WHITE FOREHEAD LAY ONE OF SAMS BROWN HANDS AND THE OTHER LAY SOFTLY UPON HIS MASTERS BREAST PEACE WAS IN BOTH THEIR FACES
GOLLUM LOOKED AT THEM A STRANGE EXPRESSION PASSED OVER HIS LEAN HUNGRY FACE THE GLEAM FADED FROM HIS EYES AND THEY WENT DIM AND GREY OLD AND TIRED A SPASM OF PAIN SEEMED TO TWIST HIM AND HE TURNED AWAY PEERING BACK UP TOWARDS THE PASS SHAKING HIS HEAD AS IF ENGAGED IN SOME INTERIOR DEBATE THEN HE CAME BACK AND SLOWLY PUTTING OUT A TREMBLING HAND VERY CAUTIOUSLY HE TOUCHED FRODOS KNEE  BUT ALMOST THE TOUCH WAS A CARESS FOR A FLEETING MOMENT COULD ONE OF THE SLEEPERS HAVE SEEN HIM THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY BEHELD AN OLD WEARY HOBBIT SHRUNKEN BY THE YEARS THAT HAD CARRIED HIM FAR BEYOND HIS TIME BEYOND FRIENDS AND KIN AND THE FIELDS AND STREAMS OF YOUTH AN OLD STARVED PITIABLE THING
BUT AT THAT TOUCH FRODO STIRRED AND CRIED OUT SOFTLY IN HIS SLEEP AND IMMEDIATELY SAM WAS WIDE AWAKE THE FIRST THING HE SAW WAS GOLLUM  PAWING AT MASTER AS HE THOUGHT
HEY YOU HE SAID ROUGHLY WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
NOTHING NOTHING SAID GOLLUM SOFTLY NICE MASTER

CHAPTER 9
SHELOBS LAIR

IT MAY INDEED HAVE BEEN DAYTIME NOW AS GOLLUM SAID BUT THE HOBBITS COULD SEE LITTLE DIFFERENCE UNLESS PERHAPS THE HEAVY SKY ABOVE WAS LESS UTTERLY BLACK MORE LIKE A GREAT ROOF OF SMOKE WHILE INSTEAD OF THE DARKNESS OF DEEP NIGHT WHICH LINGERED STILL IN CRACKS AND HOLES A GREY BLURRING SHADOW SHROUDED THE STONY WORLD ABOUT THEM THEY PASSED ON GOLLUM IN FRONT AND THE HOBBITS NOW SIDE BY SIDE UP THE LONG RAVINE BETWEEN THE PIERS AND COLUMNS OF TORN AND WEATHERED ROCK STANDING LIKE HUGE UNSHAPEN STATUES ON EITHER HAND THERE WAS NO SOUND SOME WAY AHEAD A MILE OR SO PERHAPS WAS A GREAT GREY WALL A LAST HUGE UPTHRUSTING MASS OF MOUNTAINSTONE DARKER IT LOOMED AND STEADILY IT ROSE AS THEY APPROACHED UNTIL IT TOWERED UP HIGH ABOVE THEM SHUTTING OUT THE VIEW OF ALL THAT LAY BEYOND DEEP SHADOW LAY BEFORE ITS FEET SAM SNIFFED THE AIR
UGH THAT SMELL HE SAID ITS GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER
PRESENTLY THEY WERE UNDER THE SHADOW AND THERE IN THE MIDST OF IT THEY SAW THE OPENING OF A CAVE THIS IS THE WAY IN SAID GOLLUM SOFTLY THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL HE DID NOT SPEAK ITS NAME TORECH UNGOL SHELOBS LAIR OUT OF IT CAME A STENCH NOT THE SICKLY ODOUR OF DECAY IN THE MEADS OF MORGUL BUT A FOUL REEK AS IF FILTH UNNAMEABLE WERE PILED AND HOARDED IN THE DARK WITHIN
IS THIS THE ONLY WAY SMEAGOL SAID FRODO
YES YES HE ANSWERED YES WE MUST GO THIS WAY NOW
DYOU MEAN TO SAY YOUVE BEEN THROUGH THIS HOLE SAID SAM PHEW BUT PERHAPS YOU DONT MIND BAD SMELLS
GOLLUMS EYES GLINTED HE DOESNT KNOW WHAT WE MINDS DOES HE PRECIOUS NO HE DOESNT BUT SMEAGOL CAN BEAR THINGS YES HES BEEN THROUGH O YES RIGHT THROUGH ITS THE ONLY WAY
AND WHAT MAKES THE SMELL I WONDER SAID SAM ITS LIKE  WELL I WOULDNT LIKE TO SAY SOME BEASTLY HOLE OF THE ORCS ILL WARRANT WITH A HUNDRED YEARS OF THEIR FILTH IN IT
WELL SAID FRODO ORCS OR NO IF ITS THE ONLY WAY WE MUST TAKE IT
DRAWING A DEEP BREATH THEY PASSED INSIDE IN A FEW STEPS THEY WERE IN UTTER AND IMPENETRABLE DARK NOT SINCE THE LIGHTLESS PASSAGES OF MORIA HAD FRODO OR SAM KNOWN SUCH DARKNESS AND IF POSSIBLE HERE IT WAS DEEPER AND DENSER THERE THERE WERE AIRS MOVING AND ECHOES AND A SENSE OF SPACE HERE THE AIR WAS STILL STAGNANT HEAVY AND SOUND FELL DEAD THEY WALKED AS IT WERE IN A BLACK VAPOUR WROUGHT OF VERITABLE DARKNESS ITSELF THAT AS IT WAS BREATHED BROUGHT BLINDNESS NOT ONLY TO THE EYES BUT TO THE MIND SO THAT EVEN THE MEMORY OF COLOURS AND OF FORMS AND OF ANY LIGHT FADED OUT OF THOUGHT NIGHT ALWAYS HAD BEEN AND ALWAYS WOULD BE AND NIGHT WAS ALL
BUT FOR A WHILE THEY COULD STILL FEEL AND INDEED THE SENSES OF THEIR FEET AND FINGERS AT FIRST SEEMED SHARPENED ALMOST PAINFULLY THE WALLS FELT TO THEIR SURPRISE SMOOTH AND THE FLOOR SAVE FOR A STEP NOW AND AGAIN WAS STRAIGHT AND EVEN GOING EVER UP AT THE SAME STIFF SLOPE THE TUNNEL WAS HIGH AND WIDE SO WIDE THAT THOUGH THE HOBBITS WALKED ABREAST ONLY TOUCHING THE SIDEWALLS WITH THEIR OUTSTRETCHED HANDS THEY WERE SEPARATED CUT OFF ALONE IN THE DARKNESS
GOLLUM HAD GONE IN FIRST AND SEEMED TO BE ONLY A FEW STEPS AHEAD WHILE THEY WERE STILL ABLE TO GIVE HEED TO SUCH THINGS THEY COULD HEAR HIS BREATH HISSING AND GASPING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM BUT AFTER A TIME THEIR SENSES BECAME DULLER BOTH TOUCH AND HEARING SEEMED TO GROW NUMB AND THEY KEPT ON GROPING WALKING ON AND ON MAINLY BY THE FORCE OF THE WILL WITH WHICH THEY HAD ENTERED WILL TO GO THROUGH AND DESIRE TO COME AT LAST TO THE HIGH GATE BEYOND
BEFORE THEY HAD GONE VERY FAR PERHAPS BUT TIME AND DISTANCE SOON PASSED OUT OF HIS RECKONING SAM ON THE RIGHT FEELING THE WALL WAS AWARE THAT THERE WAS AN OPENING AT THE SIDE FOR A MOMENT HE CAUGHT A FAINT BREATH OF SOME AIR LESS HEAVY AND THEN THEY PASSED IT BY
THERES MORE THAN ONE PASSAGE HERE HE WHISPERED WITH AN EFFORT IT SEEMED HARD TO MAKE HIS BREATH GIVE ANY SOUND ITS AS ORCLIKE A PLACE AS EVER THERE COULD BE
AFTER THAT FIRST HE ON THE RIGHT AND THEN FRODO ON THE LEFT PASSED THREE OR FOUR SUCH OPENINGS SOME WIDER SOME SMALLER BUT THERE WAS AS YET NO DOUBT OF THE MAIN WAY FOR IT WAS STRAIGHT AND DID NOT TURN AND STILL WENT STEADILY UP BUT HOW LONG WAS IT HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS WOULD THEY HAVE TO ENDURE OR COULD THEY ENDURE THE BREATHLESSNESS OF THE AIR WAS GROWING AS THEY CLIMBED AND NOW THEY SEEMED OFTEN IN THE BLIND DARK TO SENSE SOME RESISTANCE THICKER THAN THE FOUL AIR AS THEY THRUST FORWARD THEY FELT THINGS BRUSH AGAINST THEIR HEADS OR AGAINST THEIR HANDS LONG TENTACLES OR HANGING GROWTHS PERHAPS THEY COULD NOT TELL WHAT THEY WERE AND STILL THE STENCH GREW IT GREW UNTIL ALMOST IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT SMELL WAS THE ONLY CLEAR SENSE LEFT TO THEM AND THAT WAS FOR THEIR TORMENT ONE HOUR TWO HOURS THREE HOURS HOW MANY HAD THEY PASSED IN THIS LIGHTLESS HOLE HOURS  DAYS WEEKS RATHER SAM LEFT THE TUNNELSIDE AND SHRANK TOWARDS FRODO AND THEIR HANDS MET AND CLASPED AND SO TOGETHER THEY STILL WENT ON
AT LENGTH FRODO GROPING ALONG THE LEFTHAND WALL CAME SUDDENLY TO A VOID ALMOST HE FELL SIDEWAYS INTO THE EMPTINESS HERE WAS SOME OPENING IN THE ROCK FAR WIDER THAN ANY THEY HAD YET PASSED AND OUT OF IT CAME A REEK SO FOUL AND A SENSE OF LURKING MALICE SO INTENSE THAT FRODO REELED AND AT THAT MOMENT SAM TOO LURCHED AND FELL FORWARDS
FIGHTING OFF BOTH THE SICKNESS AND THE FEAR FRODO GRIPPED SAMS HAND UP HE SAID IN A HOARSE BREATH WITHOUT VOICE IT ALL COMES FROM HERE THE STENCH AND THE PERIL NOW FOR IT QUICK
CALLING UP HIS REMAINING STRENGTH AND RESOLUTION HE DRAGGED SAM TO HIS FEET AND FORCED HIS OWN LIMBS TO MOVE SAM STUMBLED BESIDE HIM ONE STEP TWO STEPS THREE STEPSAT LAST SIX STEPS MAYBE THEY HAD PASSED THE DREADFUL UNSEEN OPENING BUT WHETHER THAT WAS SO OR NOT SUDDENLY IT WAS EASIER TO MOVE AS IF SOME HOSTILE WILL FOR THE MOMENT HAD RELEASED THEM THEY STRUGGLED ON STILL HAND IN HAND
BUT ALMOST AT ONCE THEY CAME TO A NEW DIFFICULTY THE TUNNEL FORKED OR SO IT SEEMED AND IN THE DARK THEY COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAS THE WIDER WAY OR WHICH KEPT NEARER TO THE STRAIGHT WHICH SHOULD THEY TAKE THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT THEY KNEW OF NOTHING TO GUIDE THEM YET A FALSE CHOICE WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE FATAL
WHICH WAY HAS GOLLUM GONE PANTED SAM AND WHY DIDNT HE WAIT
SMEAGOL SAID FRODO TRYING TO CALL SMEAGOL BUT HIS VOICE CROAKED AND THE NAME FELL DEAD ALMOST AS IT LEFT HIS LIPS THERE WAS NO ANSWER NOT AN ECHO NOT EVEN A TREMOR OF THE AIR
HES REALLY GONE THIS TIME I FANCY MUTTERED SAM I GUESS THIS IS JUST EXACTLY WHERE HE MEANT TO BRING US GOLLUM IF EVER I LAY HANDS ON YOU AGAIN YOULL BE SORRY FOR IT
PRESENTLY GROPING AND FUMBLING IN THE DARK THEY FOUND THAT THE OPENING ON THE LEFT WAS BLOCKED EITHER IT WAS A BLIND OR ELSE SOME GREAT STONE HAD FALLEN IN THE PASSAGE THIS CANT BE THE WAY FRODO WHISPERED RIGHT OR WRONG WE MUST TAKE THE OTHER
AND QUICK SAM PANTED THERES SOMETHING WORSE THAN GOLLUM ABOUT I CAN FEEL SOMETHING LOOKING AT US
THEY HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN A FEW YARDS WHEN FROM BEHIND THEM CAME A SOUND STARTLING AND HORRIBLE IN THE HEAVY PADDED SILENCE A GURGLING BUBBLING NOISE AND A LONG VENOMOUS HISS THEY WHEELED ROUND BUT NOTHING COULD BE SEEN STILL AS STONES THEY STOOD STARING WAITING FOR THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT
ITS A TRAP SAID SAM AND HE LAID HIS HAND UPON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD AND AS HE DID SO HE THOUGHT OF THE DARKNESS OF THE BARROW WHENCE IT CAME I WISH OLD TOM WAS NEAR US NOW HE THOUGHT THEN AS HE STOOD DARKNESS ABOUT HIM AND A BLACKNESS OF DESPAIR AND ANGER IN HIS HEART IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE SAW A LIGHT A LIGHT IN HIS MIND ALMOST UNBEARABLY BRIGHT AT FIRST AS A SUNRAY TO THE EYES OF ONE LONG HIDDEN IN A WINDOWLESS PIT THEN THE LIGHT BECAME COLOUR GREEN GOLD SILVER WHITE FAR OFF AS IN A LITTLE PICTURE DRAWN BY ELVENFINGERS HE SAW THE LADY GALADRIEL STANDING ON THE GRASS IN LORIEN AND GIFTS WERE IN HER HANDS AND YOU RINGBEARER HE HEARD HER SAY REMOTE BUT CLEAR FOR YOU I HAVE PREPARED THIS
THE BUBBLING HISS DREW NEARER AND THERE WAS A CREAKING AS OF SOME GREAT JOINTED THING THAT MOVED WITH SLOW PURPOSE IN THE DARK A REEK CAME ON BEFORE IT MASTER MASTER CRIED SAM AND THE LIFE AND URGENCY CAME BACK INTO HIS VOICE THE LADYS GIFT THE STARGLASS A LIGHT TO YOU IN DARK PLACES SHE SAID IT WAS TO BE THE STARGLASS
THE STARGLASS MUTTERED FRODO AS ONE ANSWERING OUT OF SLEEP HARDLY COMPREHENDING WHY YES WHY HAD I FORGOTTEN IT A LIGHT WHEN ALL OTHER LIGHTS GO OUT AND NOW INDEED LIGHT ALONE CAN HELP US
SLOWLY HIS HAND WENT TO HIS BOSOM AND SLOWLY HE HELD ALOFT THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL FOR A MOMENT IT GLIMMERED FAINT AS A RISING STAR STRUGGLING IN HEAVY EARTHWARD MISTS AND THEN AS ITS POWER WAXED AND HOPE GREW IN FRODOS MIND IT BEGAN TO BURN AND KINDLED TO A SILVER FLAME A MINUTE HEART OF DAZZLING LIGHT AS THOUGH EARENDIL HAD HIMSELF COME DOWN FROM THE HIGH SUNSET PATHS WITH THE LAST SILMARIL UPON HIS BROW THE DARKNESS RECEDED FROM IT UNTIL IT SEEMED TO SHINE IN THE CENTRE OF A GLOBE OF AIRY CRYSTAL AND THE HAND THAT HELD IT SPARKLED WITH WHITE FIRE
FRODO GAZED IN WONDER AT THIS MARVELLOUS GIFT THAT HE HAD SO LONG CARRIED NOT GUESSING ITS FULL WORTH AND POTENCY SELDOM HAD HE REMEMBERED IT ON THE ROAD UNTIL THEY CAME TO MORGUL VALE AND NEVER HAD HE USED IT FOR FEAR OF ITS REVEALING LIGHT AIYA EARENDIL ELENION ANCALIMA HE CRIED AND KNEW NOT WHAT HE HAD SPOKEN FOR IT SEEMED THAT ANOTHER VOICE SPOKE THROUGH HIS CLEAR UNTROUBLED BY THE FOUL AIR OF THE PIT
BUT OTHER POTENCIES THERE ARE IN MIDDLEEARTH POWERS OF NIGHT AND THEY ARE OLD AND STRONG AND SHE THAT WALKED IN THE DARKNESS HAD HEARD THE ELVES CRY THAT CRY FAR BACK IN THE DEEPS OF TIME AND SHE HAD NOT HEEDED IT AND IT DID NOT DAUNT HER NOW EVEN AS FRODO SPOKE HE FELT A GREAT MALICE BENT UPON HIM AND A DEADLY REGARD CONSIDERING HIM NOT FAR DOWN THE TUNNEL BETWEEN THEM AND THE OPENING WHERE THEY HAD REELED AND STUMBLED HE WAS AWARE OF EYES GROWING VISIBLE TWO GREAT CLUSTERS OF MANYWINDOWED EYES  THE COMING MENACE WAS UNMASKED AT LAST THE RADIANCE OF THE STARGLASS WAS BROKEN AND THROWN BACK FROM THEIR THOUSAND FACETS BUT BEHIND THE GLITTER A PALE DEADLY FIRE BEGAN STEADILY TO GLOW WITHIN A FLAME KINDLED IN SOME DEEP PIT OF EVIL THOUGHT MONSTROUS AND ABOMINABLE EYES THEY WERE BESTIAL AND YET FILLED WITH PURPOSE AND WITH HIDEOUS DELIGHT GLOATING OVER THEIR PREY TRAPPED BEYOND ALL HOPE OF ESCAPE
FRODO AND SAM HORRORSTRICKEN BEGAN SLOWLY TO BACK AWAY THEIR OWN GAZE HELD BY THE DREADFUL STARE OF THOSE BALEFUL EYES BUT AS THEY BACKED SO THE EYES ADVANCED FRODOS HAND WAVERED AND SLOWLY THE PHIAL DROOPED THEN SUDDENLY RELEASED FROM THE HOLDING SPELL TO RUN A LITTLE WHILE IN VAIN PANIC FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE EYES THEY BOTH TURNED AND FLED TOGETHER BUT EVEN AS THEY RAN FRODO LOOKED BACK AND SAW WITH TERROR THAT AT ONCE THE EYES CAME LEAPING UP BEHIND THE STENCH OF DEATH WAS LIKE A CLOUD ABOUT HIM
STAND STAND HE CRIED DESPERATELY RUNNING IS NO USE
SLOWLY THE EYES CREPT NEARER
GALADRIEL HE CALLED AND GATHERING HIS COURAGE HE LIFTED UP THE PHIAL ONCE MORE THE EYES HALTED FOR A MOMENT THEIR REGARD RELAXED AS IF SOME HINT OF DOUBT TROUBLED THEM THEN FRODOS HEART FLAMED WITHIN HIM AND WITHOUT THINKING WHAT HE DID WHETHER IT WAS FOLLY OR DESPAIR OR COURAGE HE TOOK THE PHIAL IN HIS LEFT HAND AND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND DREW HIS SWORD STING FLASHED OUT AND THE SHARP ELVENBLADE SPARKLED IN THE SILVER LIGHT BUT AT ITS EDGES A BLUE FIRE FLICKED THEN HOLDING THE STAR ALOFT AND THE BRIGHT SWORD ADVANCED FRODO HOBBIT OF THE SHIRE WALKED STEADILY DOWN TO MEET THE EYES
THEY WAVERED DOUBT CAME INTO THEM AS THE LIGHT APPROACHED ONE BY ONE THEY DIMMED AND SLOWLY THEY DREW BACK NO BRIGHTNESS SO DEADLY HAD EVER AFFLICTED THEM BEFORE FROM SUN AND MOON AND STAR THEY HAD BEEN SAFE UNDERGROUND BUT NOW A STAR HAD DESCENDED INTO THE VERY EARTH STILL IT APPROACHED AND THE EYES BEGAN TO QUAIL ONE BY ONE THEY ALL WENT DARK THEY TURNED AWAY AND A GREAT BULK BEYOND THE LIGHTS REACH HEAVED ITS HUGE SHADOW IN BETWEEN THEY WERE GONE
MASTER MASTER CRIED SAM HE WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIS OWN SWORD DRAWN AND READY STARS AND GLORY BUT THE ELVES WOULD MAKE A SONG OF THAT IF EVER THEY HEARD OF IT AND MAY I LIVE TO TELL THEM AND HEAR THEM SING BUT DONT GO ON MASTER DONT GO DOWN TO THAT DEN NOWS OUR ONLY CHANCE NOW LETS GET OUT OF THIS FOUL HOLE
AND SO BACK THEY TURNED ONCE MORE FIRST WALKING AND THEN RUNNING FOR AS THEY WENT THE FLOOR OF THE TUNNEL ROSE STEEPLY AND WITH EVERY STRIDE THEY CLIMBED HIGHER ABOVE THE STENCHES OF THE UNSEEN LAIR AND STRENGTH RETURNED TO LIMB AND HEART BUT STILL THE HATRED OF THE WATCHER LURKED BEHIND THEM BLIND FOR A WHILE PERHAPS BUT UNDEFEATED STILL BENT ON DEATH AND NOW THERE CAME A FLOW OF AIR TO MEET THEM COLD AND THIN THE OPENING THE TUNNELS END AT LAST IT WAS BEFORE THEM PANTING YEARNING FOR A ROOFLESS PLACE THEY FLUNG THEMSELVES FORWARD AND THEN IN AMAZEMENT THEY STAGGERED TUMBLING BACK THE OUTLET WAS BLOCKED WITH SOME BARRIER BUT NOT OF STONE SOFT AND A LITTLE YIELDING IT SEEMED AND YET STRONG AND IMPERVIOUS AIR FILTERED THROUGH BUT NOT A GLIMMER OF ANY LIGHT ONCE MORE THEY CHARGED AND WERE HURLED BACK
HOLDING ALOFT THE PHIAL FRODO LOOKED AND BEFORE HIM HE SAW A GREYNESS WHICH THE RADIANCE OF THE STARGLASS DID NOT PIERCE AND DID NOT ILLUMINATE AS IF IT WERE A SHADOW THAT BEING CAST BY NO LIGHT NO LIGHT COULD DISSIPATE ACROSS THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT OF THE TUNNEL A VAST WEB WAS SPUN ORDERLY AS THE WEB OF SOME HUGE SPIDER BUT DENSERWOVEN AND FAR GREATER AND EACH THREAD WAS AS THICK AS ROPE
SAM LAUGHED GRIMLY COBWEBS HE SAID IS THAT ALL COBWEBS BUT WHAT A SPIDER HAVE AT EM DOWN WITH EM
IN A FURY HE HEWED AT THEM WITH HIS SWORD BUT THE THREAD THAT HE STRUCK DID NOT BREAK IT GAVE A LITTLE AND THEN SPRANG BACK LIKE A PLUCKED BOWSTRING TURNING THE BLADE AND TOSSING UP BOTH SWORD AND ARM THREE TIMES SAM STRUCK WITH ALL HIS FORCE AND AT LAST ONE SINGLE CORD OF ALL THE COUNTLESS CORDS SNAPPED AND TWISTED CURLING AND WHIPPING THROUGH THE AIR ONE END OF IT LASHED SAMS HAND AND HE CRIED OUT IN PAIN STARTING BACK AND DRAWING HIS HAND ACROSS HIS MOUTH
IT WILL TAKE DAYS TO CLEAR THE ROAD LIKE THIS HE SAID WHATS TO BE DONE HAVE THOSE EYES COME BACK
NO NOT TO BE SEEN SAID FRODO BUT I STILL FEEL THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT ME OR THINKING ABOUT ME MAKING SOME OTHER PLAN PERHAPS IF THIS LIGHT WERE LOWERED OR IF IT FAILED THEY WOULD QUICKLY COME AGAIN
TRAPPED IN THE END SAID SAM BITTERLY HIS ANGER RISING AGAIN ABOVE WEARINESS AND DESPAIR GNATS IN A NET MAY THE CURSE OF FARAMIR BITE THAT GOLLUM AND BITE HIM QUICK
THAT WOULD NOT HELP US NOW SAID FRODO COME LET US SEE WHAT STING CAN DO IT IS AN ELVENBLADE THERE WERE WEBS OF HORROR IN THE DARK RAVINES OF BELERIAND WHERE IT WAS FORGED BUT YOU MUST BE THE GUARD AND HOLD BACK THE EYES HERE TAKE THE STARGLASS DO NOT BE AFRAID HOLD IT UP AND WATCH
THEN FRODO STEPPED UP TO THE GREAT GREY NET AND HEWED IT WITH A WIDE SWEEPING STROKE DRAWING THE BITTER EDGE SWIFTLY ACROSS A LADDER OF CLOSESTRUNG CORDS AND AT ONCE SPRINGING AWAY THE BLUEGLEAMING BLADE SHORE THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH GRASS AND THEY LEAPED AND WRITHED AND THEN HUNG LOOSE A GREAT RENT WAS MADE
STROKE AFTER STROKE HE DEALT UNTIL AT LAST ALL THE WEB WITHIN HIS REACH WAS SHATTERED AND THE UPPER PORTION BLEW AND SWAYED LIKE A LOOSE VEIL IN THE INCOMING WIND THE TRAP WAS BROKEN
COME CRIED FRODO ON ON WILD JOY AT THEIR ESCAPE FROM THE VERY MOUTH OF DESPAIR SUDDENLY FILLED ALL HIS MIND HIS HEAD WHIRLED AS WITH A DRAUGHT OF POTENT WINE HE SPRANG OUT SHOUTING AS HE CAME
IT SEEMED LIGHT IN THAT DARK LAND TO HIS EYES THAT HAD PASSED THROUGH THE DEN OF NIGHT THE GREAT SMOKES HAD RISEN AND GROWN THINNER AND THE LAST HOURS OF A SOMBRE DAY WERE PASSING THE RED GLARE OF MORDOR HAD DIED AWAY IN SULLEN GLOOM YET IT SEEMED TO FRODO THAT HE LOOKED UPON A MORNING OF SUDDEN HOPE ALMOST HE HAD REACHED THE SUMMIT OF THE WALL ONLY A LITTLE HIGHER NOW THE CLEFT CIRITH UNGOL WAS BEFORE HIM A DIM NOTCH IN THE BLACK RIDGE AND THE HORNS OF ROCK DARKLING IN THE SKY ON EITHER SIDE A SHORT RACE A SPRINTERS COURSE AND HE WOULD BE THROUGH
THE PASS SAM HE CRIED NOT HEEDING THE SHRILLNESS OF HIS VOICE THAT RELEASED FROM THE CHOKING AIRS OF THE TUNNEL RANG OUT NOW HIGH AND WILD THE PASS RUN RUN AND WELL BE THROUGH  THROUGH BEFORE ANY ONE CAN STOP US
SAM CAME UP BEHIND AS FAST AS HE COULD URGE HIS LEGS BUT GLAD AS HE WAS TO BE FREE HE WAS UNEASY AND AS HE RAN HE KEPT ON GLANCING BACK AT THE DARK ARCH OF THE TUNNEL FEARING TO SEE EYES OR SOME SHAPE BEYOND HIS IMAGINING SPRING OUT IN PURSUIT TOO LITTLE DID HE OR HIS MASTER KNOW OF THE CRAFT OF SHELOB SHE HAD MANY EXITS FROM HER LAIR
THERE AGELONG SHE HAD DWELT AN EVIL THING IN SPIDERFORM EVEN SUCH AS ONCE OF OLD HAD LIVED IN THE LAND OF THE ELVES IN THE WEST THAT IS NOW UNDER THE SEA SUCH AS BEREN FOUGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS OF TERROR IN DORIATH AND SO CAME TO LUTHIEN UPON THE GREEN SWARD AMID THE HEMLOCKS IN THE MOONLIGHT LONG AGO HOW SHELOB CAME THERE FLYING FROM RUIN NO TALE TELLS FOR OUT OF THE DARK YEARS FEW TALES HAVE COME BUT STILL SHE WAS THERE WHO WAS THERE BEFORE SAURON AND BEFORE THE FIRST STONE OF BARADDUR AND SHE SERVED NONE BUT HERSELF DRINKING THE BLOOD OF ELVES AND MEN BLOATED AND GROWN FAT WITH ENDLESS BROODING ON HER FEASTS WEAVING WEBS OF SHADOW FOR ALL LIVING THINGS WERE HER FOOD AND HER VOMIT DARKNESS FAR AND WIDE HER LESSER BROODS BASTARDS OF THE MISERABLE MATES HER OWN OFFSPRING THAT SHE SLEW SPREAD FROM GLEN TO GLEN FROM THE EPHEL DUATH TO THE EASTERN HILLS TO DOL GULDUR AND THE FASTNESSES OF MIRKWOOD BUT NONE COULD RIVAL HER SHELOB THE GREAT LAST CHILD OF UNGOLIANT TO TROUBLE THE UNHAPPY WORLD
ALREADY YEARS BEFORE GOLLUM HAD BEHELD HER SMEAGOL WHO PRIED INTO ALL DARK HOLES AND IN PAST DAYS HE HAD BOWED AND WORSHIPPED HER AND THE DARKNESS OF HER EVIL WILL WALKED THROUGH ALL THE WAYS OF HIS WEARINESS BESIDE HIM CUTTING HIM OFF FROM LIGHT AND FROM REGRET AND HE HAD PROMISED TO BRING HER FOOD BUT HER LUST WAS NOT HIS LUST LITTLE SHE KNEW OF OR CARED FOR TOWERS OR RINGS OR ANYTHING DEVISED BY MIND OR HAND WHO ONLY DESIRED DEATH FOR ALL OTHERS MIND AND BODY AND FOR HERSELF A GLUT OF LIFE ALONE SWOLLEN TILL THE MOUNTAINS COULD NO LONGER HOLD HER UP AND THE DARKNESS COULD NOT CONTAIN HER
BUT THAT DESIRE WAS YET FAR AWAY AND LONG NOW HAD SHE BEEN HUNGRY LURKING IN HER DEN WHILE THE POWER OF SAURON GREW AND LIGHT AND LIVING THINGS FORSOOK HIS BORDERS AND THE CITY IN THE VALLEY WAS DEAD AND NO ELF OR MAN CAME NEAR ONLY THE UNHAPPY ORCS POOR FOOD AND WARY BUT SHE MUST EAT AND HOWEVER BUSILY THEY DELVED NEW WINDING PASSAGES FROM THE PASS AND FROM THEIR TOWER EVER SHE FOUND SOME WAY TO SNARE THEM BUT SHE LUSTED FOR SWEETER MEAT AND GOLLUM HAD BROUGHT IT TO HER
WELL SEE WELL SEE HE SAID OFTEN TO HIMSELF WHEN THE EVIL MOOD WAS ON HIM AS HE WALKED THE DANGEROUS ROAD FROM EMYN MUIL TO MORGUL VALE WELL SEE IT MAY WELL BE O YES IT MAY WELL BE THAT WHEN SHE THROWS AWAY THE BONES AND THE EMPTY GARMENTS WE SHALL FIND IT WE SHALL GET IT THE PRECIOUS A REWARD FOR POOR SMEAGOL WHO BRINGS NICE FOOD AND WELL SAVE THE PRECIOUS AS WE PROMISED O YES AND WHEN WEVE GOT IT SAFE THEN SHELL KNOW IT O YES THEN WELL PAY HER BACK MY PRECIOUS THEN WELL PAY EVERYONE BACK
SO HE THOUGHT IN AN INNER CHAMBER OF HIS CUNNING WHICH HE STILL HOPED TO HIDE FROM HER EVEN WHEN HE HAD COME TO HER AGAIN AND HAD BOWED LOW BEFORE HER WHILE HIS COMPANIONS SLEPT
AND AS FOR SAURON HE KNEW WHERE SHE LURKED IT PLEASED HIM THAT SHE SHOULD DWELL THERE HUNGRY BUT UNABATED IN MALICE A MORE SURE WATCH UPON THAT ANCIENT PATH INTO HIS LAND THAN ANY OTHER THAT HIS SKILL COULD HAVE DEVISED AND ORCS THEY WERE USEFUL SLAVES BUT HE HAD THEM IN PLENTY IF NOW AND AGAIN SHELOB CAUGHT THEM TO STAY HER APPETITE SHE WAS WELCOME HE COULD SPARE THEM AND SOMETIMES AS A MAN MAY CAST A DAINTY TO HIS CAT HIS CAT HE CALLS HER BUT SHE OWNS HIM NOT SAURON WOULD SEND HER PRISONERS THAT HE HAD NO BETTER USES FOR HE WOULD HAVE THEM DRIVEN TO HER HOLE AND REPORT BROUGHT BACK TO HIM OF THE PLAY SHE MADE
SO THEY BOTH LIVED DELIGHTING IN THEIR OWN DEVICES AND FEARED NO ASSAULT NOR WRATH NOR ANY END OF THEIR WICKEDNESS NEVER YET HAD ANY FLY ESCAPED FROM SHELOBS WEBS AND THE GREATER NOW WAS HER RAGE AND HUNGER
BUT NOTHING OF THIS EVIL WHICH THEY HAD STIRRED UP AGAINST THEM DID POOR SAM KNOW EXCEPT THAT A FEAR WAS GROWING ON HIM A MENACE WHICH HE COULD NOT SEE AND SUCH A WEIGHT DID IT BECOME THAT IT WAS A BURDEN TO HIM TO RUN AND HIS FEET SEEMED LEADEN
DREAD WAS ROUND HIM AND ENEMIES BEFORE HIM IN THE PASS AND HIS MASTER WAS IN A FEY MOOD RUNNING HEEDLESSLY TO MEET THEM TURNING HIS EYES AWAY FROM THE SHADOW BEHIND AND THE DEEP GLOOM BENEATH THE CLIFF UPON HIS LEFT HE LOOKED AHEAD AND HE SAW TWO THINGS THAT INCREASED HIS DISMAY HE SAW THAT THE SWORD WHICH FRODO STILL HELD UNSHEATHED WAS GLITTERING WITH BLUE FLAME AND HE SAW THAT THOUGH THE SKY BEHIND WAS NOW DARK STILL THE WINDOW IN THE TOWER WAS GLOWING RED
ORCS HE MUTTERED WELL NEVER RUSH IT LIKE THIS THERES ORCS ABOUT AND WORSE THAN ORCS THEN RETURNING QUICKLY TO HIS LONG HABIT OF SECRECY HE CLOSED HIS HAND ABOUT THE PRECIOUS PHIAL WHICH HE STILL BORE RED WITH HIS OWN LIVING BLOOD HIS HAND SHONE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HE THRUST THE REVEALING LIGHT DEEP INTO A POCKET NEAR HIS BREAST AND DREW HIS ELVENCLOAK ABOUT HIM NOW HE TRIED TO QUICKEN HIS PACE HIS MASTER WAS GAINING ON HIM ALREADY HE WAS SOME TWENTY STRIDES AHEAD FLITTING ON LIKE A SHADOW SOON HE WOULD BE LOST TO SIGHT IN THAT GREY WORLD
HARDLY HAD SAM HIDDEN THE LIGHT OF THE STARGLASS WHEN SHE CAME A LITTLE WAY AHEAD AND TO HIS LEFT HE SAW SUDDENLY ISSUING FROM A BLACK HOLE OF SHADOW UNDER THE CLIFF THE MOST LOATHLY SHAPE THAT HE HAD EVER BEHELD HORRIBLE BEYOND THE HORROR OF AN EVIL DREAM MOST LIKE A SPIDER SHE WAS BUT HUGER THAN THE GREAT HUNTING BEASTS AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN THEY BECAUSE OF THE EVIL PURPOSE IN HER REMORSELESS EYES THOSE SAME EYES THAT HE HAD THOUGHT DAUNTED AND DEFEATED THERE THEY WERE LIT WITH A FELL LIGHT AGAIN CLUSTERING IN HER OUTTHRUST HEAD GREAT HORNS SHE HAD AND BEHIND HER SHORT STALKLIKE NECK WAS HER HUGE SWOLLEN BODY A VAST BLOATED BAG SWAYING AND SAGGING BETWEEN HER LEGS ITS GREAT BULK WAS BLACK BLOTCHED WITH LIVID MARKS BUT THE BELLY UNDERNEATH WAS PALE AND LUMINOUS AND GAVE FORTH A STENCH HER LEGS WERE BENT WITH GREAT KNOBBED JOINTS HIGH ABOVE HER BACK AND HAIRS THAT STUCK OUT LIKE STEEL SPINES AND AT EACH LEGS END THERE WAS A CLAW
AS SOON AS SHE HAD SQUEEZED HER SOFT SQUELCHING BODY AND ITS FOLDED LIMBS OUT OF THE UPPER EXIT FROM HER LAIR SHE MOVED WITH A HORRIBLE SPEED NOW RUNNING ON HER CREAKING LEGS NOW MAKING A SUDDEN BOUND SHE WAS BETWEEN SAM AND HIS MASTER EITHER SHE DID NOT SEE SAM OR SHE AVOIDED HIM FOR THE MOMENT AS THE BEARER OF THE LIGHT AND FIXED ALL HER INTENT UPON ONE PREY UPON FRODO BEREFT OF HIS PHIAL RUNNING HEEDLESS UP THE PATH UNAWARE YET OF HIS PERIL SWIFTLY HE RAN BUT SHELOB WAS SWIFTER IN A FEW LEAPS SHE WOULD HAVE HIM
SAM GASPED AND GATHERED ALL HIS REMAINING BREATH TO SHOUT LOOK OUT BEHIND HE YELLED LOOK OUT MASTER IM  BUT SUDDENLY HIS CRY WAS STIFLED
A LONG CLAMMY HAND WENT OVER HIS MOUTH AND ANOTHER CAUGHT HIM BY THE NECK WHILE SOMETHING WRAPPED ITSELF ABOUT HIS LEG TAKEN OFF HIS GUARD HE TOPPLED BACKWARDS INTO THE ARMS OF HIS ATTACKER
GOT HIM HISSED GOLLUM IN HIS EAR AT LAST MY PRECIOUS WEVE GOT HIM YES THE NASSTY HOBBIT WE TAKES THIS ONE SHELL GET THE OTHER O YES SHELOB WILL GET HIM NOT SMEAGOL HE PROMISED HE WONT HURT MASTER AT ALL BUT HES GOT YOU YOU NASSTY FILTHY LITTLE SNEAK HE SPAT ON SAMS NECK
FURY AT THE TREACHERY AND DESPERATION AT THE DELAY WHEN HIS MASTER WAS IN DEADLY PERIL GAVE TO SAM A SUDDEN VIOLENCE AND STRENGTH THAT WAS FAR BEYOND ANYTHING THAT GOLLUM HAD EXPECTED FROM THIS SLOW STUPID HOBBIT AS HE THOUGHT HIM NOT GOLLUM HIMSELF COULD HAVE TWISTED MORE QUICKLY OR MORE FIERCELY HIS HOLD ON SAMS MOUTH SLIPPED AND SAM DUCKED AND LUNGED FORWARD AGAIN TRYING TO TEAR AWAY FROM THE GRIP ON HIS NECK HIS SWORD WAS STILL IN HIS HAND AND ON HIS LEFT ARM HANGING BY ITS THONG WAS FARAMIRS STAFF DESPERATELY HE TRIED TO TURN AND STAB HIS ENEMY BUT GOLLUM WAS TOO QUICK HIS LONG RIGHT ARM SHOT OUT AND HE GRABBED SAMS WRIST HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE A VICE SLOWLY AND RELENTLESSLY HE BENT THE HAND DOWN AND FORWARD TILL WITH A CRY OF PAIN SAM RELEASED THE SWORD AND IT FELL TO THE GROUND AND ALL THE WHILE GOLLUMS OTHER HAND WAS TIGHTENING ON SAMS THROAT
THEN SAM PLAYED HIS LAST TRICK WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE PULLED AWAY AND GOT HIS FEET FIRMLY PLANTED THEN SUDDENLY HE DROVE HIS LEGS AGAINST THE GROUND AND WITH HIS WHOLE FORCE HURLED HIMSELF BACKWARDS
NOT EXPECTING EVEN THIS SIMPLE TRICK FROM SAM GOLLUM FELL OVER WITH SAM ON TOP AND HE RECEIVED THE WEIGHT OF THE STURDY HOBBIT IN HIS STOMACH A SHARP HISS CAME OUT OF HIM AND FOR A SECOND HIS HAND UPON SAMS THROAT LOOSENED BUT HIS FINGERS STILL GRIPPED THE SWORDHAND SAM TORE HIMSELF FORWARD AND AWAY AND STOOD UP AND THEN QUICKLY HE WHEELED AWAY TO HIS RIGHT PIVOTED ON THE WRIST HELD BY GOLLUM LAYING HOLD OF THE STAFF WITH HIS LEFT HAND SAM SWUNG IT UP AND DOWN IT CAME WITH A WHISTLING CRACK ON GOLLUMS OUTSTRETCHED ARM JUST BELOW THE ELBOW
WITH A SQUEAL GOLLUM LET GO THEN SAM WADED IN NOT WAITING TO CHANGE THE STAFF FROM LEFT TO RIGHT HE DEALT ANOTHER SAVAGE BLOW QUICK AS A SNAKE GOLLUM SLITHERED ASIDE AND THE STROKE AIMED AT HIS HEAD FELL ACROSS HIS BACK THE STAFF CRACKED AND BROKE THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM GRABBING FROM BEHIND WAS AN OLD GAME OF HIS AND SELDOM HAD HE FAILED IN IT BUT THIS TIME MISLED BY SPITE HE HAD MADE THE MISTAKE OF SPEAKING AND GLOATING BEFORE HE HAD BOTH HANDS ON HIS VICTIMS NECK EVERYTHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL PLAN SINCE THAT HORRIBLE LIGHT HAD SO UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED IN THE DARKNESS AND NOW HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH A FURIOUS ENEMY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS OWN SIZE THIS FIGHT WAS NOT FOR HIM SAM SWEPT UP HIS SWORD FROM THE GROUND AND RAISED IT GOLLUM SQUEALED AND SPRINGING ASIDE ON TO ALL FOURS HE JUMPED AWAY IN ONE BIG BOUND LIKE A FROG BEFORE SAM COULD REACH HIM HE WAS OFF RUNNING WITH AMAZING SPEED BACK TOWARDS THE TUNNEL
SWORD IN HAND SAM WENT AFTER HIM FOR THE MOMENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE RED FURY IN HIS BRAIN AND THE DESIRE TO KILL GOLLUM BUT BEFORE HE COULD OVERTAKE HIM GOLLUM WAS GONE THEN AS THE DARK HOLE STOOD BEFORE HIM AND THE STENCH CAME OUT TO MEET HIM LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER THE THOUGHT OF FRODO AND THE MONSTER SMOTE UPON SAMS MIND HE SPUN ROUND AND RUSHED WILDLY UP THE PATH CALLING AND CALLING HIS MASTERS NAME HE WAS TOO LATE SO FAR GOLLUMS PLOT HAD SUCCEEDED



CHAPTER 10
THE CHOICES OF MASTER SAMWISE

FRODO WAS LYING FACE UPWARD ON THE GROUND AND THE MONSTER WAS BENDING OVER HIM SO INTENT UPON HER VICTIM THAT SHE TOOK NO HEED OF SAM AND HIS CRIES UNTIL HE WAS CLOSE AT HAND AS HE RUSHED UP HE SAW THAT FRODO WAS ALREADY BOUND IN CORDS WOUND ABOUT HIM FROM ANKLE TO SHOULDER AND THE MONSTER WITH HER GREAT FORELEGS WAS BEGINNING HALF TO LIFT HALF TO DRAG HIS BODY AWAY
ON THE NEAR SIDE OF HIM LAY GLEAMING ON THE GROUND HIS ELVENBLADE WHERE IT HAD FALLEN USELESS FROM HIS GRASP SAM DID NOT WAIT TO WONDER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE OR WHETHER HE WAS BRAVE OR LOYAL OR FILLED WITH RAGE HE SPRANG FORWARD WITH A YELL AND SEIZED HIS MASTERS SWORD IN HIS LEFT HAND THEN HE CHARGED NO ONSLAUGHT MORE FIERCE WAS EVER SEEN IN THE SAVAGE WORLD OF BEASTS WHERE SOME DESPERATE SMALL CREATURE ARMED WITH LITTLE TEETH ALONE WILL SPRING UPON A TOWER OF HORN AND HIDE THAT STANDS ABOVE ITS FALLEN MATE
DISTURBED AS IF OUT OF SOME GLOATING DREAM BY HIS SMALL YELL SHE TURNED SLOWLY THE DREADFUL MALICE OF HER GLANCE UPON HIM BUT ALMOST BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE THAT A FURY WAS UPON HER GREATER THAN ANY SHE HAD KNOWN IN COUNTLESS YEARS THE SHINING SWORD BIT UPON HER FOOT AND SHORE AWAY THE CLAW SAM SPRANG IN INSIDE THE ARCHES OF HER LEGS AND WITH A QUICK UPTHRUST OF HIS OTHER HAND STABBED AT THE CLUSTERED EYES UPON HER LOWERED HEAD ONE GREAT EYE WENT DARK
NOW THE MISERABLE CREATURE WAS RIGHT UNDER HER FOR THE MOMENT OUT OF THE REACH OF HER STING AND OF HER CLAWS HER VAST BELLY WAS ABOVE HIM WITH ITS PUTRID LIGHT AND THE STENCH OF IT ALMOST SMOTE HIM DOWN STILL HIS FURY HELD FOR ONE MORE BLOW AND BEFORE SHE COULD SINK UPON HIM SMOTHERING HIM AND ALL HIS LITTLE IMPUDENCE OF COURAGE HE SLASHED THE BRIGHT ELVENBLADE ACROSS HER WITH DESPERATE STRENGTH
BUT SHELOB WAS NOT AS DRAGONS ARE NO SOFTER SPOT HAD SHE SAVE ONLY HER EYES KNOBBED AND PITTED WITH CORRUPTION WAS HER AGEOLD HIDE BUT EVER THICKENED FROM WITHIN WITH LAYER ON LAYER OF EVIL GROWTH THE BLADE SCORED IT WITH A DREADFUL GASH BUT THOSE HIDEOUS FOLDS COULD NOT BE PIERCED BY ANY STRENGTH OF MEN NOT THOUGH ELF OR DWARF SHOULD FORGE THE STEEL OR THE HAND OF BEREN OR OF TURIN WIELD IT SHE YIELDED TO THE STROKE AND THEN HEAVED UP THE GREAT BAG OF HER BELLY HIGH ABOVE SAMS HEAD POISON FROTHED AND BUBBLED FROM THE WOUND NOW SPLAYING HER LEGS SHE DROVE HER HUGE BULK DOWN ON HIM AGAIN TOO SOON FOR SAM STILL STOOD UPON HIS FEET AND DROPPING HIS OWN SWORD WITH BOTH HANDS HE HELD THE ELVENBLADE POINT UPWARDS FENDING OFF THAT GHASTLY ROOF AND SO SHELOB WITH THE DRIVING FORCE OF HER OWN CRUEL WILL WITH STRENGTH GREATER THAN ANY WARRIORS HAND THRUST HERSELF UPON A BITTER SPIKE DEEP DEEP IT PRICKED AS SAM WAS CRUSHED SLOWLY TO THE GROUND
NO SUCH ANGUISH HAD SHELOB EVER KNOWN OR DREAMED OF KNOWING IN ALL HER LONG WORLD OF WICKEDNESS NOT THE DOUGHTIEST SOLDIER OF OLD GONDOR NOR THE MOST SAVAGE ORC ENTRAPPED HAD EVER THUS ENDURED HER OR SET BLADE TO HER BELOVED FLESH A SHUDDER WENT THROUGH HER HEAVING UP AGAIN WRENCHING AWAY FROM THE PAIN SHE BENT HER WRITHING LIMBS BENEATH HER AND SPRANG BACKWARDS IN A CONVULSIVE LEAP
SAM HAD FALLEN TO HIS KNEES BY FRODOS HEAD HIS SENSES REELING IN THE FOUL STENCH HIS TWO HANDS STILL GRIPPING THE HILT OF THE SWORD THROUGH THE MIST BEFORE HIS EYES HE WAS AWARE DIMLY OF FRODOS FACE AND STUBBORNLY HE FOUGHT TO MASTER HIMSELF AND TO DRAG HIMSELF OUT OF THE SWOON THAT WAS UPON HIM SLOWLY HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAW HER ONLY A FEW PACES AWAY EYEING HIM HER BEAK DRABBLING A SPITTLE OF VENOM AND A GREEN OOZE TRICKLING FROM BELOW HER WOUNDED EYE THERE SHE CROUCHED HER SHUDDERING BELLY SPLAYED UPON THE GROUND THE GREAT BOWS OF HER LEGS QUIVERING AS SHE GATHERED HERSELF FOR ANOTHER SPRING  THIS TIME TO CRUSH AND STING TO DEATH NO LITTLE BITE OF POISON TO STILL THE STRUGGLING OF HER MEAT THIS TIME TO SLAY AND THEN TO REND
EVEN AS SAM HIMSELF CROUCHED LOOKING AT HER SEEING HIS DEATH IN HER EYES A THOUGHT CAME TO HIM AS IF SOME REMOTE VOICE HAD SPOKEN AND HE FUMBLED IN HIS BREAST WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND FOUND WHAT HE SOUGHT COLD AND HARD AND SOLID IT SEEMED TO HIS TOUCH IN A PHANTOM WORLD OF HORROR THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL
GALADRIEL HE SAID FAINTLY AND THEN HE HEARD VOICES FAR OFF BUT CLEAR THE CRYING OF THE ELVES AS THEY WALKED UNDER THE STARS IN THE BELOVED SHADOWS OF THE SHIRE AND THE MUSIC OF THE ELVES AS IT CAME THROUGH HIS SLEEP IN THE HALL OF FIRE IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND
GILTHONIEL A ELBERETH

AND THEN HIS TONGUE WAS LOOSED AND HIS VOICE CRIED IN A LANGUAGE WHICH HE DID NOT KNOW
A ELBERETH GILTHONIEL
O MENEL PALANDIRIEL
LE NALLON SI DINGURUTHOS
A TIRO NIN FANUILOS

AND WITH THAT HE STAGGERED TO HIS FEET AND WAS SAMWISE THE HOBBIT HAMFASTS SON AGAIN
NOW COME YOU FILTH HE CRIED YOUVE HURT MY MASTER YOU BRUTE AND YOULL PAY FOR IT WERE GOING ON BUT WELL SETTLE WITH YOU FIRST COME ON AND TASTE IT AGAIN
AS IF HIS INDOMITABLE SPIRIT HAD SET ITS POTENCY IN MOTION THE GLASS BLAZED SUDDENLY LIKE A WHITE TORCH IN HIS HAND IT FLAMED LIKE A STAR THAT LEAPING FROM THE FIRMAMENT SEARS THE DARK AIR WITH INTOLERABLE LIGHT NO SUCH TERROR OUT OF HEAVEN HAD EVER BURNED IN SHELOBS FACE BEFORE THE BEAMS OF IT ENTERED INTO HER WOUNDED HEAD AND SCORED IT WITH UNBEARABLE PAIN AND THE DREADFUL INFECTION OF LIGHT SPREAD FROM EYE TO EYE SHE FELL BACK BEATING THE AIR WITH HER FORELEGS HER SIGHT BLASTED BY INNER LIGHTNINGS HER MIND IN AGONY THEN TURNING HER MAIMED HEAD AWAY SHE ROLLED ASIDE AND BEGAN TO CRAWL CLAW BY CLAW TOWARDS THE OPENING IN THE DARK CLIFF BEHIND
SAM CAME ON HE WAS REELING LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN BUT HE CAME ON AND SHELOB COWED AT LAST SHRUNKEN IN DEFEAT JERKED AND QUIVERED AS SHE TRIED TO HASTEN FROM HIM SHE REACHED THE HOLE AND SQUEEZING DOWN LEAVING A TRAIL OF GREENYELLOW SLIME SHE SLIPPED IN EVEN AS SAM HEWED A LAST STROKE AT HER DRAGGING LEGS THEN HE FELL TO THE GROUND
SHELOB WAS GONE AND WHETHER SHE LAY LONG IN HER LAIR NURSING HER MALICE AND HER MISERY AND IN SLOW YEARS OF DARKNESS HEALED HERSELF FROM WITHIN REBUILDING HER CLUSTERED EYES UNTIL WITH HUNGER LIKE DEATH SHE SPUN ONCE MORE HER DREADFUL SNARES IN THE GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW THIS TALE DOES NOT TELL
SAM WAS LEFT ALONE WEARILY AS THE EVENING OF THE NAMELESS LAND FELL UPON THE PLACE OF BATTLE HE CRAWLED BACK TO HIS MASTER
MASTER DEAR MASTER HE SAID BUT FRODO DID NOT SPEAK AS HE HAD RUN FORWARD EAGER REJOICING TO BE FREE SHELOB WITH HIDEOUS SPEED HAD COME BEHIND AND WITH ONE SWIFT STROKE HAD STUNG HIM IN THE NECK HE LAY NOW PALE AND HEARD NO VOICE AND DID NOT MOVE
MASTER DEAR MASTER SAID SAM AND THROUGH A LONG SILENCE WAITED LISTENING IN VAIN
THEN AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD HE CUT AWAY THE BINDING CORDS AND LAID HIS HEAD UPON FRODOS BREAST AND TO HIS MOUTH BUT NO STIR OF LIFE COULD HE FIND NOR FEEL THE FAINTEST FLUTTER OF THE HEART OFTEN HE CHAFED HIS MASTERS HANDS AND FEET AND TOUCHED HIS BROW BUT ALL WERE COLD
FRODO MR FRODO HE CALLED DONT LEAVE ME HERE ALONE ITS YOUR SAM CALLING DONT GO WHERE I CANT FOLLOW WAKE UP MR FRODO O WAKE UP FRODO ME DEAR ME DEAR WAKE UP
THEN ANGER SURGED OVER HINT AND HE RAN ABOUT HIS MASTERS BODY IN A RAGE STABBING THE AIR AND SMITING THE STONES AND SHOUTING CHALLENGES PRESENTLY HE CAME BACK AND BENDING LOOKED AT FRODOS FACE PALE BENEATH HIM IN THE DUSK AND SUDDENLY HE SAW THAT HE WAS IN THE PICTURE THAT WAS REVEALED TO HIM IN THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL IN LORIEN FRODO WITH A PALE FACE LYING FAST ASLEEP UNDER A GREAT DARK CLIFF OR FAST ASLEEP HE HAD THOUGHT THEN HES DEAD HE SAID NOT ASLEEP DEAD AND AS HE SAID IT AS IF THE WORDS HAD SET THE VENOM TO ITS WORK AGAIN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE HUE OF THE FACE GREW LIVID GREEN
AND THEN BLACK DESPAIR CAME DOWN ON HIM AND SAM BOWED TO THE GROUND AND DREW HIS GREY HOOD OVER HIS HEAD AND NIGHT CAME INTO HIS HEART AND HE KNEW NO MORE
WHEN AT LAST THE BLACKNESS PASSED SAM LOOKED UP AND SHADOWS WERE ABOUT HIM BUT FOR HOW MANY MINUTES OR HOURS THE WORLD HAD GONE DRAGGING ON HE COULD NOT TELL HE WAS STILL IN THE SAME PLACE AND STILL HIS MASTER LAY BESIDE HIM DEAD THE MOUNTAINS HAD NOT CRUMBLED NOR THE EARTH FALLEN INTO RUIN
WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT SHALL I DO HE SAID DID I COME ALL THIS WAY WITH HIM FOR NOTHING AND THEN HE REMEMBERED HIS OWN VOICE SPEAKING WORDS THAT AT THE TIME HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIMSELF AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR JOURNEY I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO BEFORE THE END I MUST SEE IT THROUGH SIR IF YOU UNDERSTAND
BUT WHAT CAN I DO NOT LEAVE MR FRODO DEAD UNBURIED ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS AND GO HOME OR GO ON GO ON HE REPEATED AND FOR A MOMENT DOUBT AND FEAR SHOOK HIM GO ON IS THAT WHAT IVE GOT TO DO AND LEAVE HIM
THEN AT LAST HE BEGAN TO WEEP AND GOING TO FRODO HE COMPOSED HIS BODY AND FOLDED HIS COLD HANDS UPON HIS BREAST AND WRAPPED HIS CLOAK ABOUT HIM AND HE LAID HIS OWN SWORD AT ONE SIDE AND THE STAFF THAT FARAMIR HAD GIVEN AT THE OTHER
IF IM TO GO ON HE SAID THEN I MUST TAKE YOUR SWORD BY YOUR LEAVE MR FRODO BUT ILL PUT THIS ONE TO LIE BY YOU AS IT LAY BY THE OLD KING IN THE BARROW AND YOUVE GOT YOUR BEAUTIFUL MITHRIL COAT FROM OLD MR BILBO AND YOUR STARGLASS MR FRODO YOU DID LEND IT TO ME AND ILL NEED IT FOR ILL BE ALWAYS IN THE DARK NOW ITS TOO GOOD FOR ME AND THE LADY GAVE IT TO YOU BUT MAYBE SHED UNDERSTAND DO YOU UNDERSTAND MR FRODO IVE GOT TO GO ON
BUT HE COULD NOT GO NOT YET HE KNELT AND HELD FRODOS HAND AND COULD NOT RELEASE IT AND TIME WENT BY AND STILL HE KNELT HOLDING HIS MASTERS HAND AND IN HIS HEART KEEPING A DEBATE
NOW HE TRIED TO FIND STRENGTH TO TEAR HIMSELF AWAY AND GO ON A LONELY JOURNEY  FOR VENGEANCE IF ONCE HE COULD GO HIS ANGER WOULD BEAR HIM DOWN ALL THE ROADS OF THE WORLD PURSUING UNTIL HE HAD HIM AT LAST GOLLUM THEN GOLLUM WOULD DIE IN A CORNER BUT THAT WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD SET OUT TO DO IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH WHILE TO LEAVE HIS MASTER FOR THAT IT WOULD NOT BRING HIM BACK NOTHING WOULD THEY HAD BETTER BOTH BE DEAD TOGETHER AND THAT TOO WOULD BE A LONELY JOURNEY
HE LOOKED ON THE BRIGHT POINT OF THE SWORD HE THOUGHT OF THE PLACES BEHIND WHERE THERE WAS A BLACK BRINK AND AN EMPTY FALL INTO NOTHINGNESS THERE WAS NO ESCAPE THAT WAY THAT WAS TO DO NOTHING NOT EVEN TO GRIEVE THAT WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD SET OUT TO DO WHAT AM I TO DO THEN HE CRIED AGAIN AND NOW HE SEEMED PLAINLY TO KNOW THE HARD ANSWER SEE IT THROUGH ANOTHER LONELY JOURNEY AND THE WORST
WHAT ME ALONE GO TO THE CRACK OF DOOM AND ALL HE QUAILED STILL BUT THE RESOLVE GREW WHAT ME TAKE THE RING FROM HIM THE COUNCIL GAVE IT TO HIM
BUT THE ANSWER CAME AT ONCE AND THE COUNCIL GAVE HIM COMPANIONS SO THAT THE ERRAND SHOULD NOT FAIL AND YOU ARE THE LAST OF ALL THE COMPANY THE ERRAND MUST NOT FAIL
I WISH I WASNT THE LAST HE GROANED I WISH OLD GANDALF WAS HERE OR SOMEBODY WHY AM I LEFT ALL ALONE TO MAKE UP MY MIND IM SURE TO GO WRONG AND ITS NOT FOR ME TO GO TAKING THE RING PUTTING MYSELF FORWARD
BUT YOU HAVENT PUT YOURSELF FORWARD YOUVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AND AS FOR NOT BEING THE RIGHT AND PROPER PERSON WHY MR FRODO WASNT AS YOU MIGHT SAY NOR MR BILBO THEY DIDNT CHOOSE THEMSELVES
AH WELL I MUST MAKE UP MY OWN MIND I WILL MAKE IT UP BUT ILL BE SURE TO GO WRONG THATD BE SAM GAMGEE ALL OVER
LET ME SEE NOW IF WERE FOUND HERE OR MR FRODOS FOUND AND THAT THINGS ON HIM WELL THE ENEMY WILL GET IT AND THATS THE END OF ALL OF US OF LORIEN AND RIVENDELL AND THE SHIRE AND ALL AND THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE OR ITLL BE THE END ANYWAY THE WARS BEGUN AND MORE THAN LIKELY THINGS ARE ALL GOING THE ENEMYS WAY ALREADY NO CHANCE TO GO BACK WITH IT AND GET ADVICE OR PERMISSION NO ITS SIT HERE TILL THEY COME AND KILL ME OVER MASTERS BODY AND GETS IT OR TAKE IT AND GO HE DREW A DEEP BREATH THEN TAKE IT IT IS
HE STOOPED VERY GENTLY HE UNDID THE CLASP AT THE NECK AND SLIPPED HIS HAND INSIDE FRODOS TUNIC THEN WITH HIS OTHER HAND RAISING THE HEAD HE KISSED THE COLD FOREHEAD AND SOFTLY DREW THE CHAIN OVER IT AND THEN THE HEAD LAY QUIETLY BACK AGAIN IN REST NO CHANGE CAME OVER THE STILL FACE AND BY THAT MORE THAN BY ALL OTHER TOKENS SAM WAS CONVINCED AT LAST THAT FRODO HAD DIED AND LAID ASIDE THE QUEST
GOODBYE MASTER MY DEAR HE MURMURED FORGIVE YOUR SAM HELL COME BACK TO THIS SPOT WHEN THE JOBS DONE  IF HE MANAGES IT AND THEN HELL NOT LEAVE YOU AGAIN REST YOU QUIET TILL I COME AND MAY NO FOUL CREATURE COME ANIGH YOU AND IF THE LADY COULD HEAR ME AND GIVE ME ONE WISH I WOULD WISH TO COME BACK AND FIND YOU AGAIN GOODBYE
AND THEN HE BENT HIS OWN NECK AND PUT THE CHAIN UPON IT AND AT ONCE HIS HEAD WAS BOWED TO THE GROUND WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE RING AS IF A GREAT STONE HAD BEEN STRUNG ON HIM BUT SLOWLY AS IF THE WEIGHT BECAME LESS OR NEW STRENGTH GREW IN HIM HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND THEN WITH A GREAT EFFORT GOT TO HIS FEET AND FOUND THAT HE COULD WALK AND BEAR HIS BURDEN AND FOR A MOMENT HE LIFTED UP THE PHIAL AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIS MASTER AND THE LIGHT BURNED GENTLY NOW WITH THE SOFT RADIANCE OF THE EVENINGSTAR IN SUMMER AND IN THAT LIGHT FRODOS FACE WAS FAIR OF HUE AGAIN PALE BUT BEAUTIFUL WITH AN ELVISH BEAUTY AS OF ONE WHO HAS LONG PASSED THE SHADOWS AND WITH THE BITTER COMFORT OF THAT LAST SIGHT SAM TURNED AND HID THE LIGHT AND STUMBLED ON INTO THE GROWING DARK
HE HAD NOT FAR TO GO THE TUNNEL WAS SOME WAY BEHIND THE CLEFT A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OR LESS THE PATH WAS VISIBLE IN THE DUSK A DEEP RUT WORN IN AGES OF PASSAGE RUNNING NOW GENTLY UP IN A LONG TROUGH WITH CLIFFS ON EITHER SIDE THE TROUGH NARROWED RAPIDLY SOON SAM CAME TO A LONG FLIGHT OF BROAD SHALLOW STEPS NOW THE ORCTOWER WAS RIGHT ABOVE HIM FROWNING BLACK AND IN IT THE RED EYE GLOWED NOW HE WAS HIDDEN IN THE DARK SHADOW UNDER IT HE WAS COMING TO THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND WAS IN THE CLEFT AT LAST
IVE MADE UP MY MIND HE KEPT SAYING TO HIMSELF BUT HE HAD NOT THOUGH HE HAD DONE HIS BEST TO THINK IT OUT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS ALTOGETHER AGAINST THE GRAIN OF HIS NATURE HAVE I GOT IT WRONG HE MUTTERED WHAT OUGHT I TO HAVE DONE
AS THE SHEER SIDES OF THE CLEFT CLOSED ABOUT HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE ACTUAL SUMMIT BEFORE HE LOOKED AT LAST ON THE PATH DESCENDING INTO THE NAMELESS LAND HE TURNED FOR A MOMENT MOTIONLESS IN INTOLERABLE DOUBT HE LOOKED BACK HE COULD STILL SEE LIKE A SMALL BLOT IN THE GATHERING GLOOM THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD SEE OR GUESS WHERE FRODO LAY HE FANCIED THERE WAS A GLIMMER ON THE GROUND DOWN THERE OR PERHAPS IT WAS SOME TRICK OF HIS TEARS AS HE PEERED OUT AT THAT HIGH STONY PLACE WHERE ALL HIS LIFE HAD FALLEN IN RUIN
IF ONLY I COULD HAVE MY WISH MY ONE WISH HE SIGHED TO GO BACK AND FIND HIM THEN AT LAST HE TURNED TO THE ROAD IN FRONT AND TOOK A FEW STEPS THE HEAVIEST AND THE MOST RELUCTANT HE HAD EVER TAKEN
ONLY A FEW STEPS AND NOW ONLY A FEW MORE AND HE WOULD BE GOING DOWN AND WOULD NEVER SEE THAT HIGH PLACE AGAIN AND THEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD CRIES AND VOICES HE STOOD STILL AS STONE ORCVOICES THEY WERE BEHIND HIM AND BEFORE HIM A NOISE OF TRAMPING FEET AND HARSH SHOUTS ORCS WERE COMING UP TO THE CLEFT FROM THE FAR SIDE FROM SOME ENTRY TO THE TOWER PERHAPS TRAMPING FEET AND SHOUTS BEHIND HE WHEELED ROUND HE SAW SMALL RED LIGHTS TORCHES WINKING AWAY BELOW THERE AS THEY ISSUED FROM THE TUNNEL AT LAST THE HUNT WAS UP THE RED EYE OF THE TOWER HAD NOT BEEN BLIND HE WAS CAUGHT
NOW THE FLICKER OF APPROACHING TORCHES AND THE CLINK OF STEEL AHEAD WAS VERY NEAR IN A MINUTE THEY WOULD REACH THE TOP AND BE ON HIM HE HAD TAKEN TOO LONG IN MAKING UP HIS MIND AND NOW IT WAS NO GOOD HOW COULD HE ESCAPE OR SAVE HIMSELF OR SAVE THE RING THE RING HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY THOUGHT OR DECISION HE SIMPLY FOUND HIMSELF DRAWING OUT THE CHAIN AND TAKING THE RING IN HIS HAND THE HEAD OF THE ORCCOMPANY APPEARED IN THE CLEFT RIGHT BEFORE HIM THEN HE PUT IT ON
THE WORLD CHANGED AND A SINGLE MOMENT OF TIME WAS FILLED WITH AN HOUR OF THOUGHT AT ONCE HE WAS AWARE THAT HEARING WAS SHARPENED WHILE SIGHT WAS DIMMED BUT OTHERWISE THAN IN SHELOBS LAIR ALL THINGS ABOUT HIM NOW WERE NOT DARK BUT VAGUE WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS THERE IN A GREY HAZY WORLD ALONE LIKE A SMALL BLACK SOLID ROCK AND THE RING WEIGHING DOWN HIS LEFT HAND WAS LIKE AN ORB OF HOT GOLD HE DID NOT FEEL INVISIBLE AT ALL BUT HORRIBLY AND UNIQUELY VISIBLE AND HE KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE AN EYE WAS SEARCHING FOR HIM
HE HEARD THE CRACK OF STONE AND THE MURMUR OF WATER FAR OFF IN MORGUL VALE AND DOWN AWAY UNDER THE ROCK THE BUBBLING MISERY OF SHELOB GROPING LOST IN SOME BLIND PASSAGE AND VOICES IN THE DUNGEONS OF THE TOWER AND THE CRIES OF THE ORCS AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE TUNNEL AND DEAFENING ROARING IN HIS EARS THE CRASH OF THE FEET AND THE RENDING CLAMOUR OF THE ORCS BEFORE HIM HE SHRANK AGAINST THE CLIFF BUT THEY MARCHED UP LIKE A PHANTOM COMPANY GREY DISTORTED FIGURES IN A MIST ONLY DREAMS OF FEAR WITH PALE FLAMES IN THEIR HANDS AND THEY PASSED HIM BY HE COWERED TRYING TO CREEP AWAY INTO SOME CRANNY AND TO HIDE
HE LISTENED THE ORCS FROM THE TUNNEL AND THE OTHERS MARCHING DOWN HAD SIGHTED ONE ANOTHER AND BOTH PARTIES WERE NOW HURRYING AND SHOUTING HE HEARD THEM BOTH CLEARLY AND HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY SAID PERHAPS THE RING GAVE UNDERSTANDING OF TONGUES OR SIMPLY UNDERSTANDING ESPECIALLY OF THE SERVANTS OF SAURON ITS MAKER SO THAT IF HE GAVE HEED HE UNDERSTOOD AND TRANSLATED THE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF CERTAINLY THE RING HAD GROWN GREATLY IN POWER AS IT APPROACHED THE PLACES OF ITS FORGING BUT ONE THING IT DID NOT CONFER AND THAT WAS COURAGE AT PRESENT SAM STILL THOUGHT ONLY OF HIDING OF LYING LOW TILL ALL WAS QUIET AGAIN AND HE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY HE COULD NOT TELL HOW NEAR THE VOICES WERE THE WORDS SEEMED ALMOST IN HIS EARS

HAI HOLA HERES SOMETHING LYING RIGHT IN THE ROAD A SPY A SPY THERE WAS A HOOT OF SNARLING HORNS AND A BABEL OF BAYING VOICES
WITH A DREADFUL STROKE SAM WAS WAKENED FROM HIS COWERING MOOD THEY HAD SEEN HIS MASTER WHAT WOULD THEY DO HE HAD HEARD TALES OF THE ORCS TO MAKE THE BLOOD RUN COLD IT COULD NOT BE BORNE HE SPRANG UP HE FLUNG THE QUEST AND ALL HIS DECISIONS AWAY AND FEAR AND DOUBT WITH THEM HE KNEW NOW WHERE HIS PLACE WAS AND HAD BEEN AT HIS MASTERS SIDE THOUGH WHAT HE COULD DO THERE WAS NOT CLEAR BACK HE RAN DOWN THE STEPS DOWN THE PATH TOWARDS FRODO
HOW MANY ARE THERE HE THOUGHT THIRTY OR FORTY FROM THE TOWER AT LEAST AND A LOT MORE THAN THAT FROM DOWN BELOW I GUESS HOW MANY CAN I KILL BEFORE THEY GET ME THEYLL SEE THE FLAME OF THE SWORD AS SOON AS I DRAW IT AND THEYLL GET ME SOONER OR LATER I WONDER IF ANY SONG WILL EVER MENTION IT HOW SAMWISE FELL IN THE HIGH PASS AND MADE A WALL OF BODIES ROUND HIS MASTER NO NO SONG OF COURSE NOT FOR THE RINGLL BE FOUND AND THERELL BE NO MORE SONGS I CANT HELP IT MY PLACE IS BY MR FRODO THEY MUST UNDERSTAND THAT  ELROND AND THE COUNCIL AND THE GREAT LORDS AND LADIES WITH ALL THEIR WISDOM THEIR PLANS HAVE GONE WRONG I CANT BE THEIR RINGBEARER NOT WITHOUT MR FRODO
BUT THE ORCS WERE OUT OF HIS DIM SIGHT NOW HE HAD HAD NO TIME TO CONSIDER HIMSELF BUT NOW HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS WEARY WEARY ALMOST TO EXHAUSTION HIS LEGS WOULD NOT CARRY HIM AS HE WISHED HE WAS TOO SLOW THE PATH SEEMED MILES LONG WHERE HAD THEY ALL GOT TO IN THE MIST
THERE THEY WERE AGAIN A GOOD WAY AHEAD STILL A CLUSTER OF FIGURES ROUND SOMETHING LYING ON THE GROUND A FEW SEEMED TO BE DARTING THIS WAY AND THAT BENT LIKE DOGS ON A TRAIL HE TRIED TO MAKE A SPURT

      CHAPTER 1
      MINAS TIRITH
     

     PIPPIN LOOKED OUT FROM THE SHELTER OF GANDALFS CLOAK HE WONDERED IF HE WAS AWAKE OR STILL SLEEPING STILL IN THE SWIFTMOVING DREAM IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN WRAPPED SO LONG SINCE THE GREAT RIDE BEGAN THE DARK WORLD WAS RUSHING BY AND THE WIND SANG LOUDLY IN HIS EARS HE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE WHEELING STARS AND AWAY TO HIS RIGHT VAST SHADOWS AGAINST THE SKY WHERE THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SOUTH MARCHED PAST SLEEPILY HE TRIED TO RECKON THE TIMES AND STAGES OF THEIR JOURNEY BUT HIS MEMORY WAS DROWSY AND UNCERTAIN
     THERE HAD BEEN THE FIRST RIDE AT TERRIBLE SPEED WITHOUT A HALT AND THEN IN THE DAWN HE HAD SEEN A PALE GLEAM OF GOLD AND THEY HAD COME TO THE SILENT TOWN AND THE GREAT EMPTY HOUSE ON THE HILL AND HARDLY HAD THEY REACHED ITS SHELTER WHEN THE WINGED SHADOW HAD PASSED OVER ONCE AGAIN AND MEN WILTED WITH FEAR BUT GANDALF HAD SPOKEN SOFT WORDS TO HIM AND HE HAD SLEPT IN A CORNER TIRED BUT UNEASY DIMLY AWARE OF COMINGS AND GOINGS AND OF MEN TALKING AND GANDALF GIVING ORDERS AND THEN AGAIN RIDING RIDING IN THE NIGHT THIS WAS THE SECOND NO THE THIRD NIGHT SINCE HE HAD LOOKED IN THE STONE AND WITH THAT HIDEOUS MEMORY HE WOKE FULLY AND SHIVERED AND THE NOISE OF THE WIND BECAME FILLED WITH MENACING VOICES
     A LIGHT KINDLED IN THE SKY A BLAZE OF YELLOW FIRE BEHIND DARK BARRIERS PIPPIN COWERED BACK AFRAID FOR A MOMENT WONDERING INTO WHAT DREADFUL COUNTRY GANDALF WAS BEARING HIM HE RUBBED HIS EYES AND THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS THE MOON RISING ABOVE THE EASTERN SHADOWS NOW ALMOST AT THE FULL SO THE NIGHT WAS NOT YET OLD AND FOR HOURS THE DARK JOURNEY WOULD GO ON HE STIRRED AND SPOKE
     WHERE ARE WE GANDALF HE ASKED
     IN THE REALM OF GONDOR THE WIZARD ANSWERED THE LAND OF AN
     THERE WAS A SILENCE AGAIN FOR A WHILE THEN WHAT IS THAT CRIED PIPPIN SUDDENLY CLUTCHING AT GANDALFS CLOAK LOOK FIRE RED FIRE ARE THERE DRAGONS IN THIS LAND LOOK THERE IS ANOTHER
     FOR ANSWER GANDALF CRIED ALOUD TO HIS HORSE ON SHADOWFAX WE MUST HASTEN TIME IS SHORT SEE THE BEACONS OF GONDOR ARE ALIGHT CALLING FOR AID WAR IS KINDLED SEE THERE IS THE FIRE ON AMON D
     BUT SHADOWFAX PAUSED IN HIS STRIDE SLOWING TO A WALK AND THEN HE LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND NEIGHED AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS THE ANSWERING NEIGH OF OTHER HORSES CAME AND PRESENTLY THE THUDDING OF HOOFS WAS HEARD AND THREE RIDERS SWEPT UP AND PASSED LIKE FLYING GHOSTS IN THE MOON AND VANISHED INTO THE WEST THEN SHADOWFAX GATHERED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND SPRANG AWAY AND THE NIGHT FLOWED OVER HIM LIKE A ROARING WIND
     PIPPIN BECAME DROWSY AGAIN AND PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO GANDALF TELLING HIM OF THE CUSTOMS OF GONDOR AND HOW THE LORD OF THE CITY HAD BEACONS BUILT ON THE TOPS OF OUTLYING HILLS ALONG BOTH BORDERS OF THE GREAT RANGE AND MAINTAINED POSTS AT THESE POINTS WHERE FRESH HORSES WERE ALWAYS IN READINESS TO BEAR HIS ERRANDRIDERS TO ROHAN IN THE NORTH OR TO BELFALAS IN THE SOUTH IT IS LONG SINCE THE BEACONS OF THE NORTH WERE LIT HE SAID AND IN THE ANCIENT DAYS OF GONDOR THEY WERE NOT NEEDED FOR THEY HAD THE SEVEN STONES PIPPIN STIRRED UNEASILY
     SLEEP AGAIN AND DO NOT BE AFRAID SAID GANDALF FOR YOU ARE NOT GOING LIKE FRODO TO MORDOR BUT TO MINAS TIRITH AND THERE YOU WILL BE AS SAFE AS YOU CAN BE ANYWHERE IN THESE DAYS IF GONDOR FALLS OR THE RING IS TAKEN THEN THE SHIRE WILL BE NO REFUGE
     YOU DO NOT COMFORT ME SAID PIPPIN BUT NONETHELESS SLEEP CREPT OVER HIM THE LAST THING THAT HE REMEMBERED BEFORE HE FELL INTO DEEP DREAM WAS A GLIMPSE OF HIGH WHITE PEAKS GLIMMERING LIKE FLOATING ISLES ABOVE THE CLOUDS AS THEY CAUGHT THE LIGHT OF THE WESTERING MOON HE WONDERED WHERE FRODO WAS AND IF HE WAS ALREADY IN MORDOR OR IF HE WAS DEAD AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT FRODO FROM FAR AWAY LOOKED ON THAT SAME MOON AS IT SET BEYOND GONDOR ERE THE COMING OF THE DAY
     PIPPIN WOKE TO THE SOUND OF VOICES ANOTHER DAY OF HIDING AND A NIGHT OF JOURNEY HAD FLEETED BY IT WAS TWILIGHT THE COLD DAWN WAS AT HAND AGAIN AND CHILL GREY MISTS WERE ABOUT THEM SHADOWFAX STOOD STEAMING WITH SWEAT BUT HE HELD HIS NECK PROUDLY AND SHOWED NO SIGN OF WEARINESS MANY TALL MEN HEAVILY CLOAKED STOOD BESIDE HIM AND BEHIND THEM IN THE MIST LOOMED A WALL OF STONE PARTLY RUINOUS IT SEEMED BUT ALREADY BEFORE THE NIGHT WAS PASSED THE SOUND OF HURRIED LABOUR COULD BE HEARD BEAT OF HAMMERS CLINK OF TROWELS AND THE CREAK OF WHEELS TORCHES AND FLARES GLOWED DULLY HERE AND THERE IN THE FOG GANDALF WAS SPEAKING TO THE MEN THAT BARRED HIS WAY AND AS HE LISTENED PIPPIN BECAME AWARE THAT HE HIMSELF WAS BEING DISCUSSED
     YEA TRULY WE KNOW YOU MITHRANDIR SAID THE LEADER OF THE MEN AND YOU KNOW THE PASSWORDS OF THE SEVEN GATES AND ARE FREE TO GO FORWARD BUT WE DO NOT KNOW YOUR COMPANION WHAT IS HE A DWARF OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTH WE WISH FOR NO STRANGERS IN THE LAND AT THIS TIME UNLESS THEY BE MIGHTY MEN OF ARMS IN WHOSE FAITH AND HELP WE CAN TRUST
     I WILL VOUCH FOR HIM BEFORE THE SEAT OF DENETHOR SAID GANDALF AND AS FOR VALOUR THAT CANNOT BE COMPUTED BY STATURE HE HAS PASSED THROUGH MORE BATTLES AND PERILS THAN YOU HAVE INGOLD THOUGH YOU BE TWICE HIS HEIGHT AND HE COMES NOW FROM THE STORMING OF ISENGARD OF WHICH WE BEAR TIDINGS AND GREAT WEARINESS IS ON HIM OR I WOULD WAKE HIM HIS NAME IS PEREGRIN A VERY VALIANT MAN

     YES AND ONE WHO JOURNEYED WITH HIM SAID PIPPIN AND BOROMIR OF YOUR CITY WAS WITH US AND HE SAVED ME IN THE SNOWS OF THE NORTH AND AT THE LAST HE WAS SLAIN DEFENDING ME FROM MANY FOES
     PEACE SAID GANDALF THE NEWS OF THAT GRIEF SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD FIRST TO THE FATHER

     HOBBIT SAID PIPPIN LITTLE SERVICE CAN I OFFER TO YOUR LORD BUT WHAT I CAN DO I WOULD DO REMEMBERING BOROMIR THE BRAVE
     FARE YOU WELL SAID INGOLD AND THE MEN MADE WAY FOR SHADOWFAX AND HE PASSED THROUGH A NARROW GATE IN THE WALL MAY YOU BRING GOOD COUNSEL TO DENETHOR IN HIS NEED AND TO US ALL MITHRANDIR INGOLD CRIED BUT YOU COME WITH TIDINGS OF GRIEF AND DANGER AS IS YOUR WONT THEY SAY

     THE WORK WILL BE FINISHED ERE EVENING SAID INGOLD THIS IS THE LAST PORTION OF THE WALL TO BE PUT IN DEFENCE THE LEAST OPEN TO ATTACK FOR IT LOOKS TOWARDS OUR FRIENDS OF ROHAN DO YOU KNOW AUGHT OF THEM WILL THEY ANSWER THE SUMMONS THINK YOU
     YES THEY WILL COME BUT THEY HAVE FOUGHT MANY BATTLES AT YOUR BACK THIS ROAD AND NO ROAD LOOKS TOWARDS SAFETY ANY LONGER BE VIGILANT BUT FOR GANDALF STORMCROW YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN A HOST OF FOES COMING OUT OF AN
     GANDALF PASSED NOW INTO THE WIDE LAND BEYOND THE RAMMAS ECHOR SO THE MEN OF GONDOR CALLED THE OUT WALL THAT THEY HAD BUILT WITH GREAT LABOUR AFTER ITHILIEN FELL UNDER THE SHADOW OF THEIR ENEMY FOR TEN LEAGUES OR MORE IT RAN FROM THE MOUNTAINS FEET AND SO BACK AGAIN ENCLOSING IN ITS FENCE THE FIELDS OF THE PELENNOR FAIR AND FERTILE TOWNLANDS ON THE LONG SLOPES AND TERRACES FALLING TO THE DEEP LEVELS OF THE ANDUIN AT ITS FURTHEST POINT FROM THE GREAT GATE OF THE CITY NORTHEASTWARD THE WALL WAS FOUR LEAGUES DISTANT AND THERE FROM A FROWNING BANK IT OVERLOOKED THE LONG FLATS BESIDE THE RIVER AND MEN HAD MADE IT HIGH AND STRONG FOR AT THAT POINT UPON A WALLED CAUSEWAY THE ROAD CAME IN FROM THE FORDS AND BRIDGES OF OSGILIATH AND PASSED THROUGH A GUARDED GATE BETWEEN EMBATTLED TOWERS AT ITS NEAREST POINT THE WALL WAS LITTLE MORE THAN ONE LEAGUE FROM THE CITY AND THAT WAS SOUTHEASTWARD THERE ANDUIN GOING IN A WIDE KNEE ABOUT THE HILLS OF EMYN ARNEN IN SOUTH ITHILIEN BENT SHARPLY WEST AND THE OUTWALL ROSE UPON ITS VERY BRINK AND BENEATH IT LAY THE QUAYS AND LANDINGS OF THE HARLOND FOR CRAFT THAT CAME UPSTREAM FROM THE SOUTHERN FIEFS
     THE TOWNLANDS WERE RICH WITH WIDE TILTH AND MANY ORCHARDS AND HOMESTEADS THERE WERE WITH OAST AND GARNER FOLD AND BYRE AND MANY RILLS RIPPLING THROUGH THE GREEN FROM THE HIGHLANDS DOWN TO ANDUIN YET THE HERDSMEN AND HUSBANDMEN THAT DWELT THERE WERE NOT MANY AND THE MOST PART OF THE PEOPLE OF GONDOR LIVED IN THE SEVEN CIRCLES OF THE CITY OR IN THE HIGH VALES OF THE MOUNTAINBORDERS IN LOSSARNACH OR FURTHER SOUTH IN FAIR LEBENNIN WITH ITS FIVE SWIFT STREAMS THERE DWELT A HARDY FOLK BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA THEY WERE RECKONED MEN OF GONDOR YET THEIR BLOOD WAS MINGLED AND THERE WERE SHORT AND SWARTHY FOLK AMONG THEM WHOSE SIRES CAME MORE FROM THE FORGOTTEN MEN WHO HOUSED IN THE SHADOW OF THE HILLS IN THE DARK YEARS ERE THE COMING OF THE KINGS BUT BEYOND IN THE GREAT FIEF OF BELFALAS DWELT PRINCE IMRAHIL IN HIS CASTLE OF DOL AMROTH BY THE SEA AND HE WAS OF HIGH BLOOD AND HIS FOLK ALSO TALL MEN AND PROUD WITH SEAGREY EYES
     NOW AFTER GANDALF HAD RIDDEN FOR SOME TIME THE LIGHT OF DAY GREW IN THE SKY AND PIPPIN ROUSED HIMSELF AND LOOKED UP TO HIS LEFT LAY A SEA OF MIST RISING TO A BLEAK SHADOW IN THE EAST BUT TO HIS RIGHT GREAT MOUNTAINS REARED THEIR HEADS RANGING FROM THE WEST TO A STEEP AND SUDDEN END AS IF IN THE MAKING OF THE LAND THE RIVER HAD BURST THROUGH A GREAT BARRIER CARVING OUT A MIGHTY VALLEY TO BE A LAND OF BATTLE AND DEBATE IN TIMES TO COME AND THERE WHERE THE WHITE MOUNTAINS OF ERED NIMRAIS CAME TO THEIR END HE SAW AS GANDALF HAD PROMISED THE DARK MASS OF MOUNT MINDOLLUIN THE DEEP PURPLE SHADOWS OF ITS HIGH GLENS AND ITS TALL FACE WHITENING IN THE RISING DAY AND UPON ITS OUTTHRUST KNEE WAS THE GUARDED CITY WITH ITS SEVEN WALLS OF STONE SO STRONG AND OLD THAT IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN NOT BUILDED BUT CARVEN BY GIANTS OUT OF THE BONES OF THE EARTH
     EVEN AS PIPPIN GAZED IN WONDER THE WALLS PASSED FROM LOOMING GREY TO WHITE BLUSHING FAINTLY IN THE DAWN AND SUDDENLY THE SUN CLIMBED OVER THE EASTERN SHADOW AND SENT FORTH A SHAFT THAT SMOTE THE FACE OF THE CITY THEN PIPPIN CRIED ALOUD FOR THE TOWER OF ECTHELION STANDING HIGH WITHIN THE TOPMOST WALLS SHONE OUT AGAINST THE SKY GLIMMERING LIKE A SPIKE OF PEARL AND SILVER TALL AND FAIR AND SHAPELY AND ITS PINNACLE GLITTERED AS IF IT WERE WROUGHT OF CRYSTALS AND WHITE BANNERS BROKE AND FLUTTERED FROM THE BATTLEMENTS IN THE MORNING BREEZE AND HIGH AND FAR HE HEARD A CLEAR RINGING AS OF SILVER TRUMPETS
     SO GANDALF AND PEREGRIN RODE TO THE GREAT GATE OF THE MEN OF GONDOR AT THE RISING OF THE SUN AND ITS IRON DOORS ROLLED BACK BEFORE THEM
     MITHRANDIR MITHRANDIR MEN CRIED NOW WE KNOW THAT THE STORM IS INDEED NIGH
     IT IS UPON YOU SAID GANDALF I HAVE RIDDEN ON ITS WINGS LET ME PASS I MUST COME TO YOUR LORD DENETHOR WHILE HIS STEWARDSHIP LASTS WHATEVER BETIDE YOU HAVE COME TO THE END OF THE GONDOR THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN LET ME PASS
     THEN MEN FELL BACK BEFORE THE COMMAND OF HIS VOICE AND QUESTIONED HIM NO FURTHER THOUGH THEY GAZED IN WONDER AT THE HOBBIT THAT SAT BEFORE HIM AND AT THE HORSE THAT BORE HIM FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY USED HORSES VERY LITTLE AND THEY WERE SELDOM SEEN IN THEIR STREETS SAVE ONLY THOSE RIDDEN BY THE ERRANDRIDERS OF THEIR LORD AND THEY SAID SURELY THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT STEEDS OF THE KING OF ROHAN MAYBE THE ROHIRRIM WILL COME SOON TO STRENGTHEN US BUT SHADOWFAX WALKED PROUDLY UP THE LONG WINDING ROAD
     FOR THE FASHION OF MINAS TIRITH WAS SUCH THAT IT WAS BUILT ON SEVEN LEVELS EACH DELVED INTO THE HILL AND ABOUT EACH WAS SET A WALL AND IN EACH WALL WAS A GATE BUT THE GATES WERE NOT SET IN A LINE THE GREAT GATE IN THE CITY WALL WAS AT THE EAST POINT OF THE CIRCUIT BUT THE NEXT FACED HALF SOUTH AND THE THIRD HALF NORTH AND SO TO AND FRO UPWARDS SO THAT THE PAVED WAY THAT CLIMBED TOWARDS THE CITADEL TURNED FIRST THIS WAY AND THEN THAT ACROSS THE FACE OF THE HILL AND EACH TIME THAT IT PASSED THE LINE OF THE GREAT GATE IT WENT THROUGH AN ARCHED TUNNEL PIERCING A VAST PIER OF ROCK WHOSE HUGE OUTTHRUST BULK DIVIDED IN TWO ALL THE CIRCLES OF THE CITY SAVE THE FIRST FOR PARTLY IN THE PRIMEVAL SHAPING OF THE HILL PARTLY BY THE MIGHTY CRAFT AND LABOUR OF OLD THERE STOOD UP FROM THE REAR OF THE WIDE COURT BEHIND THE GATE A TOWERING BASTION OF STONE ITS EDGE SHARP AS A SHIPKEEL FACING EAST UP IT ROSE EVEN TO THE LEVEL OF THE TOPMOST CIRCLE AND THERE WAS CROWNED BY A BATTLEMENT SO THAT THOSE IN THE CITADEL MIGHT LIKE MARINERS IN A MOUNTAINOUS SHIP LOOK FROM ITS PEAK SHEER DOWN UPON THE GATE SEVEN HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE ENTRANCE TO THE CITADEL ALSO LOOKED EASTWARD BUT WAS DELVED IN THE HEART OF THE ROCK THENCE A LONG LAMPLIT SLOPE RAN UP TO THE SEVENTH GATE THUS MEN REACHED AT LAST THE HIGH COURT AND THE PLACE OF THE FOUNTAIN BEFORE THE FEET OF THE WHITE TOWER TALL AND SHAPELY FIFTY FATHOMS FROM ITS BASE TO THE PINNACLE WHERE THE BANNER OF THE STEWARDS FLOATED A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE PLAIN
     A STRONG CITADEL IT WAS INDEED AND NOT TO BE TAKEN BY A HOST OF ENEMIES IF THERE WERE ANY WITHIN THAT COULD HOLD WEAPONS UNLESS SOME FOE COULD COME BEHIND AND SCALE THE LOWER SKIRTS OF MINDOLLUIN AND SO COME UPON THE NARROW SHOULDER THAT JOINED THE HILL OF GUARD TO THE MOUNTAIN MASS BUT THAT SHOULDER WHICH ROSE TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FIFTH WALL WAS HEDGED WITH GREAT RAMPARTS RIGHT UP TO THE PRECIPICE THAT OVERHUNG ITS WESTERN END AND IN THAT SPACE STOOD THE HOUSES AND DOMED TOMBS OF BYGONE KINGS AND LORDS FOR EVER SILENT BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN AND THE TOWER
     PIPPIN GAZED IN GROWING WONDER AT THE GREAT STONE CITY VASTER AND MORE SPLENDID THAN ANYTHING THAT HE HAD DREAMED OF GREATER AND STRONGER THAN ISENGARD AND FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL YET IT WAS IN TRUTH FALLING YEAR BY YEAR INTO DECAY AND ALREADY IT LACKED HALF THE MEN THAT COULD HAVE DWELT AT EASE THERE IN EVERY STREET THEY PASSED SOME GREAT HOUSE OR COURT OVER WHOSE DOORS AND ARCHED GATES WERE CARVED MANY FAIR LETTERS OF STRANGE AND ANCIENT SHAPES NAMES PIPPIN GUESSED OF GREAT MEN AND KINDREDS THAT HAD ONCE DWELT THERE AND YET NOW THEY WERE SILENT AND NO FOOTSTEPS RANG ON THEIR WIDE PAVEMENTS NOR VOICE WAS HEARD IN THEIR HALLS NOR ANY FACE LOOKED OUT FROM DOOR OR EMPTY WINDOW
     
     AT LAST THEY CAME OUT OF SHADOW TO THE SEVENTH GATE AND THE WARM SUN THAT SHONE DOWN BEYOND THE RIVER AS FRODO WALKED IN THE GLADES OF ITHILIEN GLOWED HERE ON THE SMOOTH WALLS AND ROOTED PILLARS AND THE GREAT ARCH WITH KEYSTONE CARVEN IN THE LIKENESS OF A CROWNED AND KINGLY HEAD GANDALF DISMOUNTED FOR NO HORSE WAS ALLOWED IN THE CITADEL AND SHADOWFAX SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE LED AWAY AT THE SOFT WORD OF HIS MASTER
     THE GUARDS OF THE GATE WERE ROBED IN BLACK AND THEIR HELMS WERE OF STRANGE SHAPE HIGHCROWNED WITH LONG CHEEKGUARDS CLOSEFITTING TO THE FACE AND ABOVE THE CHEEKGUARDS WERE SET THE WHITE WINGS OF SEABIRDS BUT THE HELMS GLEAMED WITH A FLAME OF SILVER FOR THEY WERE INDEED WROUGHT OF MITHRIL HEIRLOOMS FROM THE GLORY OF OLD DAYS UPON THE BLACK SURCOATS WERE EMBROIDERED IN WHITE A TREE BLOSSOMING LIKE SNOW BENEATH A SILVER CROWN AND MANYPOINTED STARS THIS WAS THE LIVERY OF THE HEIRS OF ELENDIL AND NONE WORE IT NOW IN ALL GONDOR SAVE THE GUARDS OF THE CITADEL BEFORE THE COURT OF THE FOUNTAIN WHERE THE WHITE TREE ONCE HAD GROWN
     ALREADY IT SEEMED THAT WORD OF THEIR COMING HAD GONE BEFORE THEM AND AT ONCE THEY WERE ADMITTED SILENTLY AND WITHOUT QUESTION QUICKLY GANDALF STRODE ACROSS THE WHITEPAVED COURT A SWEET FOUNTAIN PLAYED THERE IN THE MORNING SUN AND A SWARD OF BRIGHT GREEN LAY ABOUT IT BUT IN THE MIDST DROOPING OVER THE POOL STOOD A DEAD TREE AND THE FALLING DROPS DRIPPED SADLY FROM ITS BARREN AND BROKEN BRANCHES BACK INTO THE CLEAR WATER
     PIPPIN GLANCED AT IT AS HE HURRIED AFTER GANDALF IT LOOKED MOURNFUL HE THOUGHT AND HE WONDERED WHY THE DEAD TREE WAS LEFT IN THIS PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE WAS WELL TENDED
     SEVEN STARS AND SEVEN STONES AND ONE WHITE TREE
     THE WORDS THAT GANDALF HAD MURMURED CAME BACK INTO HIS MIND AND THEN HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE DOORS OF THE GREAT HALL BENEATH THE GLEAMING TOWER AND BEHIND THE WIZARD HE PASSED THE TALL SILENT DOORWARDENS AND ENTERED THE COOL ECHOING SHADOWS OF THE HOUSE OF STONE
     THEY WALKED DOWN A PAVED PASSAGE LONG AND EMPTY AND AS THEY WENT GANDALF SPOKE SOFTLY TO PIPPIN BE CAREFUL OF YOUR WORDS MASTER PEREGRIN THIS IS NO TIME FOR HOBBIT PERTNESS THBECAUSE THEY WERE UNLIKE BUT UNDER COVER OF THIS LOVE HE WILL THINK IT EASIER TO LEARN WHAT HE WITCHES FROM YOU RATHER THAN FROM ME DO NOT TELL HIM MORE THAN YOU NEED AND LEAVE QUIET THE MATTER OF FRODOS ERRAND I WILL DEAL WITH THAT IN DUE TIME AND SAY NOTHING ABOUT ARAGORN EITHER UNLESS YOU MUST
     WHY NOT WHAT IS WRONG WITH STRIDER PIPPIN WHISPERED HE MEANT TO COME HERE DIDNT HE AND HELL BE ARRIVING SOON HIMSELF ANYWAY
     MAYBE MAYBE SAID GANDALF THOUGH IF HE COMES IT IS LIKELY TO BE IN SOME WAY THAT NO ONE EXPECTS NOT EVEN DENETHOR IT WILL BE BETTER SO AT LEAST HE SHOULD COME UNHERALDED BY US
     GANDALF HALTED BEFORE A TALL DOOR OF POLISHED METAL SEE MASTER PIPPIN THERE IS NO TIME TO INSTRUCT YOU NOW IN THE HISTORY OF GONDOR THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF YOU HAD LEARNED SOMETHING OF IT WHEN YOU WERE STILL BIRDSNESTING AND PLAYING TRUANT IN THE WOODS OF THE SHIRE DO AS I BID IT IS SCARCELY WISE WHEN BRINGING THE NEWS OF THE DEATH OF HIS HEIR TO A MIGHTY LORD TO SPEAK OVER MUCH OF THE COMING OF ONE WHO WILL IF HE COMES CLAIM THE KINGSHIP IS THAT ENOUGH
     KINGSHIP SAID PIPPIN AMAZED
     YES SAID GANDALF IF YOU HAVE WALKED ALL THESE DAYS WITH CLOSED EARS AND MIND ASLEEP WAKE UP NOW HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR
     THE DOOR OPENED BUT NO ONE COULD BE SEEN TO OPEN IT PIPPIN LOOKED INTO A GREAT HALL IT WAS LIT BY DEEP WINDOWS IN THE WIDE AISLES AT EITHER SIDE BEYOND THE ROWS OF TALL PILLARS THAT UPHELD THE ROOF MONOLITHS OF BLACK MARBLE THEY ROSE TO GREAT CAPITALS CARVED IN MANY STRANGE FIGURES OF BEASTS AND LEAVES AND FAR ABOVE IN SHADOW THE WIDE VAULTING GLEAMED WITH DULL GOLD INSET WITH FLOWING TRACERIES OF MANY COLOURS NO HANGINGS NOR STORIED WEBS NOR ANY THINGS OF WOVEN STUFF OR OF WOOD WERE TO BE SEEN IN THAT LONG SOLEMN HALL BUT BETWEEN THE PILLARS THERE STOOD A SILENT COMPANY OF TALL IMAGES GRAVEN IN COLD STONE
     SUDDENLY PIPPIN WAS REMINDED OF THE HEWN ROCKS OF ARGONATH AND AWE FELL ON HIM AS HE LOOKED DOWN THAT AVENUE OF KINGS LONG DEAD AT THE FAR END UPON A DAIS OF MANY STEPS WAS SET A HIGH THRONE UNDER A CANOPY OF MARBLE SHAPED LIKE A CROWNED HELM BEHIND IT WAS CARVED UPON THE WALL AND SET WITH GEMS AN IMAGE OF A TREE IN FLOWER BUT THE THRONE WAS EMPTY AT THE FOOT OF THE DAIS UPON THE LOWEST STEP WHICH WAS BROAD AND DEEP THERE WAS A STONE CHAIR BLACK AND UNADORNED AND ON IT SAT AN OLD MAN GAZING AT HIS LAP IN HIS HAND WAS A WHITE ROD WITH A GOLDEN KNOB HE DID NOT LOOK UP SOLEMNLY THEY PACED THE LONG FLOOR TOWARDS HIM UNTIL THEY STOOD THREE PACES FROM HIS FOOTSTOOL THEN GANDALF SPOKE
     HAIL LORD AND STEWARD OF MINAS TIRITH DENETHOR SON OF ECTHELION I AM COME WITH COUNSEL AND TIDINGS IN THIS DARK HOUR
     THEN THE OLD MAN LOOKED UP PIPPIN SAW HIS CARVEN FACE WITH ITS PROUD BONES AND SKIN LIKE IVORY AND THE LONG CURVED NOSE BETWEEN THE DARK DEEP EYES AND HE WAS REMINDED NOT SO MUCH OF BOROMIR AS OF ARAGORN DARK INDEED IS THE HOUR SAID THE OLD MAN AND AT SUCH TIMES YOU ARE WONT TO COME MITHRANDIR BUT THOUGH ALL THE SIGNS FOREBODE THAT THE DOOM OF GONDOR IS DRAWING NIGH LESS NOW TO ME IS THAT DARKNESS THAN MY OWN DARKNESS IT HAS BEEN TOLD TO ME THAT YOU BRING WITH YOU ONE WHO SAW MY SON DIE IS THIS HE
     
     IT IS SAID GANDALF ONE OF THE TWAIN THE OTHER IS WITH TH

     HE WOULD HAVE GONE SAID GANDALF BE NOT UNJUST IN YOUR GRIEF BOROMIR CLAIMED THE ERRAND AND WOULD NOT SUFFER ANY OTHER TO HAVE IT HE WAS A MASTERFUL MAN AND ONE TO TAKE WHAT HE DESIRED I JOURNEYED FAR WITH HIM AND LEARNED MUCH OF HIS MOOD BUT YOU SPEAK OF HIS DEATH YOU HAVE HAD NEWS OF THAT ERE WE CAME
     I HAVE RECEIVED THIS SAID DENETHOR AND LAYING DOWN HIS ROD HE LIFTED FROM HIS LAP THE THING THAT HE HAD BEEN GAZING AT IN EACH HAND HE HELD UP ONE HALF OF A GREAT HORN CLOVEN THROUGH THE MIDDLE A WILDOX HORN BOUND WITH SILVER
     THAT IS THE HORN THAT BOROMIR ALWAYS WORE CRIED PIPPIN
     VERILY SAID DENETHOR AND IN MY TURN I BORE IT AND SO DID EACH ELDEST SON OF OUR HOUSE FAR BACK INTO THE VANISHED YEARS BEFORE THE FAILING OF THE KINGS SINCE VORONDIL FATHER OF MARDIL HUNTED THE WILD KINE OF ARAW IN THE FAR FIELDS OF RHUN I HEARD IT BLOWING DIM UPON THE NORTHERN MARCHES THIRTEEN DAYS AGO AND THE RIVER BROUGHT IT TO ME BROKEN IT WILL WIND NO MORE HE PAUSED AND THERE WAS A HEAVY SILENCE SUDDENLY HE TURNED HIS BLACK GLANCE UPON PIPPIN WHAT SAY YOU TO THAT HALFLING
     THIRTEEN THIRTEEN DAYS FALTERED PIPPIN YES I THINK THAT WOULD BE SO YES I STOOD BESIDE HIM AS HE BLEW THE HORN BUT NO HELP CAME ONLY MORE ORCS
     SO SAID DENETHOR LOOKING KEENLY AT PIPPINS FACE YOU WERE THERE TELL ME MORE WHY DID NO HELP COME AND HOW DID YOU ESCAPE AND YET HE DID NOT SO MIGHTY A MAN AS HE WAS AND ONLY ORCS TO WITHSTAND HIM
     PIPPIN FLUSHED AND FORGOT HIS FEAR THE MIGHTIEST MAN MAY BE SLAIN BY ONE ARROW HE SAID AND BOROMIR WAS PIERCED BY MANY WHEN LAST I SAW HIM HE SANK BESIDE A TREE AND PLUCKED A BLACKFEATHERED SHAFT FROM HIS SIDE THEN I SWOONED AND WAS MADE CAPTIVE I SAW HIM NO MORE AND KNOW NO MORE BUT I HONOUR HIS MEMORY FOR HE WAS VERY VALIANT HE DIED TO SAVE US MY KINSMAN MERIADOC AND MYSELF WAYLAID IN THE WOODS BY THE SOLDIERY OF THE DARK LORD AND THOUGH HE FELL AND FAILED MY GRATITUDE IS NONE THE LESS
     THEN PIPPIN LOOKED THE OLD MAN IN THE EYE FOR PRIDE STIRRED STRANGELY WITHIN HIM STILL STUNG BY THE SCORN AND SUSPICION IN THAT COLD VOICE LITTLE SERVICE NO DOUBT WILL SO GREAT A LORD OF MEN THINK TO FIND IN A HOBBIT A HALFLING FROM THE NORTHERN SHIRE YET SUCH AS IT IS I WILL OFFER IT IN PAYMENT OF MY DEBT TWITCHING ASIDE HIS GREY CLOAK PIPPIN DREW FORTH HIS SMALL SWORD AND LAID IT AT DENETHORS FEET
     A PALE SMILE LIKE A GLEAM OF COLD SUN ON A WINTERS EVENING PASSED OVER THE OLD MANS FACE BUT HE BENT HIS HEAD AND HELD OUT HIS HAND LAYING THE SHARDS OF THE HORN ASIDE GIVE ME THE WEAPON HE SAID
     PIPPIN LIFTED IT AND PRESENTED THE HILT TO HIM WHENCE CAME THIS SAID DENETHOR MANY MANY YEARS LIE ON IT SURELY THIS IS A BLADE WROUGHT BY OUR OWN KINDRED IN THE NORTH IN THE DEEP PAST
     IT CAME OUT OF THE MOUNDS THAT LIE ON THE BORDERS OF MY COUNTRY SAID PIPPIN BUT ONLY EVIL WIGHTS DWELL THERE NOW AND I WILL NOT WILLINGLY TELL MORE OF THEM
     I SEE THAT STRANGE TALES ARE WOVEN ABOUT YOU SAID DENETHOR AND ONCE AGAIN IT IS SHOWN THAT LOOKS MAY BELIE THE MAN  OR THE HALFLING I ACCEPT YOUR SERVICE FOR YOU ARE NOT DAUNTED BY WORDS AND YOU HAVE COURTEOUS SPEECH STRANGE THOUGH THE SOUND OF IT MAY BE TO US IN THE SOUTH AND WE SHALL HAVE NEED OF ALL FOLK OF COURTESY BE THEY GREAT OR SMALL IN THE DAYS TO COME SWEAR TO ME NOW
     TAKE THE HILT SAID GANDALF AND SPEAK AFTER THE LORD IF YOU ARE RESOLVED ON THIS
     I AM SAID PIPPIN
     THE OLD MAN LAID THE SWORD ALONG HIS LAP AND PIPPIN PUT HIS HAND TO THE HILT AND SAID SLOWLY AFTER DENETHOR
     HERE DO I SWEAR FEALTY AND SERVICE TO GONDOR AND TO THE LORD AND STEWARD OF THE REALM TO SPEAK AND TO BE SILENT TO DO AND TO LET BE TO COME AND TO GO IN NEED OR PLENTY IN PEACE OR WAR IN LIVING OR DYING FROM THIS HOUR HENCEFORTH UNTIL MY LORD RELEASE ME OR DEATH TAKE ME OR THE WORLD END SO SAY I PEREGRIN SON OF PALADIN OF THE SHIRE OF THE HALFLINGS
     AND THIS DO I HEAR DENETHOR SON OF ECTHELION LORD OF GONDOR STEWARD OF THE HIGH KING AND I WILL NOT FORGET IT NOR FAIL TO REWARD THAT WHICH IS GIVEN FEALTY WITH LOVE VALOUR WITH HONOUR OATHBREAKING WITH VENGEANCE THEN PIPPIN RECEIVED BACK HIS SWORD AND PUT IT IN ITS SHEATH
     AND NOW SAID DENETHOR MY FIRST COMMAND TO YOU SPEAK AND BE NOT SILENT TELL ME YOUR FULL TALE AND SEE THAT YOU RECALL ALL THAT YOU CAN OF BOROMIR MY SON SIT NOW AND BEGIN AS HE SPOKE HE STRUCK A SMALL SILVER GONG THAT STOOD NEAR HIS FOOTSTOOL AND AT ONCE SERVANTS CAME FORWARD PIPPIN SAW THEN THAT THEY HAD BEEN STANDING IN ALCOVES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DOOR UNSEEN AS HE AND GANDALF ENTERED
     BRING WINE AND FOOD AND SEATS FOR THE GUESTS SAID DENETHOR AND SEE THAT NONE TROUBLE US FOR ONE HOUR
     IT IS ALL THAT I HAVE TO SPARE FOR THERE IS MUCH ELSE TO HEED HE SAID TO GANDALF MUCH OF MORE IMPORT IT MAY SEEM AND YET TO ME LESS PRESSING BUT MAYBE WE CAN SPEAK AGAIN AT THE END OF THE DAY
     AND EARLIER IT IS TO BE HOPED SAID GANDALF FOR I HAVE NOT RIDDEN HITHER FROM ISENGARD ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LEAGUES WITH THE SPEED OF WIND ONLY TO BRING YOU ONE SMALL WARRIOR HOWEVER COURTEOUS IS IT NAUGHT TO YOU THAT TH
     IT IS MUCH TO ME BUT I KNOW ALREADY SUFFICIENT OF THESE DEEDS FOR MY OWN COUNSEL AGAINST THE MENACE OF THE EAST HE TURNED HIS DARK EYES ON GANDALF AND NOW PIPPIN SAW A LIKENESS BETWEEN THE TWO AND HE FELT THE STRAIN BETWEEN THEM ALMOST AS IF HE SAW A LINE OF SMOULDERING FIRE DRAWN FROM EYE TO EYE THAT MIGHT SUDDENLY BURST INTO FLAME
     DENETHOR LOOKED INDEED MUCH MORE LIKE A GREAT WIZARD THAN GANDALF DID MORE KINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL AND OLDER YET BY A SENSE OTHER THAN SIGHT PIPPIN PERCEIVED THAT GANDALF HAD THE GREATER POWER AND THE DEEPER WISDOM AND A MAJESTY THAT WAS VEILED AND HE WAS OLDER FAR OLDER HOW MUCH OLDER HE WONDERED AND THEN HE THOUGHT HOW ODD IT WAS THAT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE TREEBEARD HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WIZARDS BUT EVEN THEN HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF GANDALF AS ONE OF THEM WHAT WAS GANDALF IN WHAT FAR TIME AND PLACE DID HE COME INTO THE WORLD AND WHEN WOULD HE LEAVE IT AND THEN HIS MUSINGS BROKE OFF AND HE SAW THAT DENETHOR AND GANDALF STILL LOOKED EACH OTHER IN THE EYE AS IF READING THE OTHERS MIND BUT IT WAS DENETHOR WHO FIRST WITHDREW HIS GAZE
     YEA HE SAID FOR THOUGH THE STONES BE LOST THEY SAY STILL THE LORDS OF GONDOR HAVE KEENER SIGHT THAN LESSER MEN AND MANY MESSAGES COME TO THEM BUT SIT NOW
     THEN MEN CAME BEARING A CHAIR AND A LOW STOOL AND ONE BROUGHT A SALVER WITH A SILVER FLAGON AND CUPS AND WHITE CAKES PIPPIN SAT DOWN BUT HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES FROM THE OLD LORD WAS IT SO OR HAD HE ONLY IMAGINED IT THAT AS HE SPOKE OF THE STONES A SUDDEN GLEAM OF HIS EYE HAD GLANCED UPON PIPPINS FACE
     NOW TELL ME YOUR TALE MY LIEGE SAID DENETHOR HALF KINDLY HALF MOCKINGLY FOR THE WORDS OF ONE WHOM MY SON SO BEFRIENDED WILL BE WELCOME INDEED
     PIPPIN NEVER FORGOT THAT HOUR IN THE GREAT HALL UNDER THE PIERCING EYE OF THE LORD OF GONDOR STABBED EVER AND ANON BY HIS SHREWD QUESTIONS AND ALL THE WHILE CONSCIOUS OF GANDALF AT HIS SIDE WATCHING AND LISTENING AND SO PIPPIN FELT HOLDING IN CHECK A RISING WRATH AND IMPATIENCE WHEN THE HOUR WAS OVER AND DENETHOR AGAIN RANG THE GONG PIPPIN FELT WORN OUT IT CANNOT BE MORE THAN NINE OCLOCK HE THOUGHT I COULD NOW EAT THREE BREAKFASTS ON END
     LEAD THE LORD MITHRANDIR TO THE HOUSING PREPARED FOR HIM SAID DENETHOR AND HIS COMPANION MAY LODGE WITH HIM FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WILL BUT BE IT KNOWN THAT I HAVE NOW SWORN HIM TO MY SERVICE AND HE SHALL BE KNOWN AS PEREGRIN SON OF PALADIN AND TAUGHT THE LESSER PASSWORDS SEND WORD TO THE CAPTAINS THAT THEY SHALL WAIT ON ME HERE AS SOON AS MAY BE AFTER THE THIRD HOUR HAS RUNG
     AND YOU MY LORD MITHRANDIR SHALL COME TOO AS AND WHEN YOU WILL NONE SHALL HINDER YOUR COMING TO ME AT ANY TIME SAVE ONLY IN MY BRIEF HOURS OF SLEEP LET YOUR WRATH AT AN OLD MANS FOLLY RUN OFF AND THEN RETURN TO MY COMFORT
     FOLLY SAID GANDALF NAY MY LORD WHEN YOU ARE A DOTARD YOU WILL DIE YOU CAN USE EVEN YOUR GRIEF AS A CLOAK DO YOU THINK THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR PURPOSE IN QUESTIONING FOR AN HOUR ONE WHO KNOWS THE LEAST WHILE I SIT BY
     IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT THEN BE CONTENT RETURNED DENETHOR PRIDE WOULD BE FOLLY THAT DISDAINED HELP AND COUNSEL AT NEED BUT YOU DEAL OUT SUCH GIFTS ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN DESIGNS YET THE LORD OF GONDOR IS NOT TO BE MADE THE TOOL OF OTHER MENS PURPOSES HOWEVER WORTHY AND TO HIM THERE IS NO PURPOSE HIGHER IN THE WORLD AS IT NOW STANDS THAN THE GOOD OF GONDOR AND THE RULE OF GONDOR MY LORD IS MINE AND NO OTHER MANS UNLESS THE KING SHOULD COME AGAIN
     UNLESS THE KING SHOULD COME AGAIN SAID GANDALF WELL MY LORD STEWARD IT IS YOUR TASK TO KEEP SOME KINGDOM STILL AGAINST THAT EVENT WHICH FEW NOW LOOK TO SEE IN THAT TASK YOU SHALL HAVE ALL THE AID THAT YOU ARE PLEASED TO ASK FOR BUT I WILL SAY THIS THE RULE OF NO REALM IS MINE NEITHER OF GONDOR NOR ANY OTHER GREAT OR SMALL BUT ALL WORTHY THINGS THAT ARE IN PERIL AS THE WORLD NOW STANDS THOSE ARE MY CARE AND FOR MY PART I SHALL NOT WHOLLY FAIL OF MY TASK THOUGH GONDOR SHOULD PERISH IF ANYTHING PASSES THROUGH THIS NIGHT THAT CAN STILL GROW FAIR OR BEAR FRUIT AND FLOWER AGAIN IN DAYS TO COME FOR I ALSO AM A STEWARD DID YOU NOT KNOW AND WITH THAT HE TURNED AND STRODE FROM THE HALL WITH PIPPIN RUNNING AT HIS SIDE
     GANDALF DID NOT LOOK AT PIPPIN OR SPEAK A WORD TO HIM AS THEY WENT THEIR GUIDE BROUGHT THEM FROM THE DOORS OF THE HALL AND THEN LED THEM ACROSS THE COURT OF THE FOUNTAIN INTO A LANE BETWEEN TALL BUILDINGS OF STONE AFTER SEVERAL TURNS THEY CAME TO A HOUSE CLOSE TO THE WALL OF THE CITADEL UPON THE NORTH SIDE NOT FAR FROM THE SHOULDER THAT LINKED THE HILL WITH THE MOUNTAIN WITHIN UPON THE FIRST FLOOR ABOVE THE STREET UP A WIDE CARVEN STAIR HE SHOWED THEM TO A FAIR ROOM LIGHT AND AIRY WITH GOODLY HANGINGS OF DULL GOLD SHEEN UNFIGURED IT WAS SPARELY FURNISHED HAVING BUT A SMALL TABLE TWO CHAIRS AND A BENCH BUT AT EITHER SIDE THERE WERE CURTAINED ALCOVES AND WELLCLAD BEDS WITHIN WITH VESSELS AND BASINS FOR WASHING THERE WERE THREE HIGH NARROW WINDOWS THAT LOOKED NORTHWARD OVER THE GREAT CURVE OF ANDUIN STILL SHROUDED IN MISTS TOWARDS THE EMYN MUIL AND RAUROS FAR AWAY PIPPIN HAD TO CLIMB ON THE BENCH TO LOOK OUT OVER THE DEEP STONE SILL
     ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME GANDALF HE SAID AS THEIR GUIDE WENT OUT AND CLOSED THE DOOR I DID THE BEST I COULD
     YOU DID INDEED SAID GANDALF LAUGHING SUDDENLY AND HE CAME AND STOOD BESIDE PIPPIN PUTTING HIS ARM ABOUT THE HOBBITS SHOULDERS AND GAZING OUT OF THE WINDOW PIPPIN GLANCED IN SOME WONDER AT THE FACE NOW CLOSE BESIDE HIS OWN FOR THE SOUND OF THAT LAUGH HAD BEEN GAY AND MERRY YET IN THE WIZARDS FACE HE SAW AT FIRST ONLY LINES OF CARE AND SORROW THOUGH AS HE LOOKED MORE INTENTLY HE PERCEIVED THAT UNDER ALL THERE WAS A GREAT JOY A FOUNTAIN OF MIRTH ENOUGH TO SET A KINGDOM LAUGHING WERE IT TO GUSH FORTH
     INDEED YOU DID YOUR BEST SAID THE WIZARD AND I HOPE THAT IT MAY BE LONG BEFORE YOU FIND YOURSELF IN SUCH A TIGHT CORNER AGAIN BETWEEN TWO SUCH TERRIBLE OLD MEN STILL THE LORD OF GONDOR LEARNED MORE FROM YOU THAN YOU MAY HAVE GUESSED PIPPIN YOU COULD NOT HIDE THE FACT THAT BOROMIR DID NOT LEAD THE COMPANY FROM MORIA AND THAT THERE WAS ONE AMONG YOU OF HIGH HONOUR WHO WAS COMING TO MINAS TIRITH AND THAT HE HAD A FAMOUS SWORD MEN THINK MUCH ABOUT THE STORIES OF OLD DAYS IN GONDOR AND DENETHOR HAS GIVEN LONG THOUGHT TO THE RHYME AND TO THE WORDS ISILDURS BANE SINCE BOROMIR WENT AWAY
     HE IS NOT AS OTHER MEN OF THIS TIME PIPPIN AND WHATEVER BE HIS DESCENT FROM FATHER TO SON BY SOME CHANCE THE BLOOD OF WESTERNESSE RUNS NEARLY TRUE IN HIM AS IT DOES IN HIS OTHER SON FARAMIR AND YET DID NOT IN BOROMIR WHOM HE LOVED BEST HE HAS LONG SIGHT HE CAN PERCEIVE IF HE BENDS HIS WILL THITHER MUCH OF WHAT IS PASSING IN THE MINDS OF MEN EVEN OF THOSE THAT DWELL FAR OFF IT IS DIFFICULT TO DECEIVE HIM AND DANGEROUS TO TRY
     REMEMBER THAT FOR YOU ARE NOW SWORN TO HIS SERVICE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT PUT IT INTO YOUR HEAD OR YOUR HEART TO DO THAT BUT IT WAS WELL DONE I DID NOT HINDER IT FOR GENEROUS DEED SHOULD NOT BE CHECKED BY COLD COUNSEL IT TOUCHED HIS HEART AS WELL MAY I SAY IT AS PLEASING HIS HUMOUR AND AT LEAST YOU ARE FREE NOW TO MOVE ABOUT AS YOU WILL IN MINAS TIRITH  WHEN YOU ARE NOT ON DUTY FOR THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO IT YOU ARE AT HIS COMMAND AND HE WILL NOT FORGET BE WARY STILL
     HE FELL SILENT AND SIGHED WELL NO NEED TO BROOD ON WHAT TOMORROW MAY BRING FOR ONE THING TOMORROW WILL BE CERTAIN TO BRING WORSE THAN TODAY FOR MANY DAYS TO COME AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE THAT I CAN DO TO HELP IT THE BOARD IS SET AND THE PIECES ARE MOVING ONE PIECE THAT I GREATLY DESIRE TO FIND IS FARAMIR NOW THE HEIR OF DENETHOR I DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS IN THE CITY BUT I HAVE HAD NO TIME TO GATHER NEWS I MUST GO PIPPIN I MUST GO TO THIS LORDS COUNCIL AND LEARN WHAT I CAN BUT THE ENEMY HAS THE MOVE AND HE IS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS FULL GAME AND PAWNS ARE LIKELY TO SEE AS MUCH OF IT AS ANY PEREGRIN SON OF PALADIN SOLDIER OF GONDOR SHARPEN YOUR BLADE
     GANDALF WENT TO THE DOOR AND THERE HE TURNED I AM IN HASTE PIPPIN HE SAID DO ME A FAVOUR WHEN YOU GO OUT EVEN BEFORE YOU REST IF YOU ARE NOT TOO WEARY GO AND FIND SHADOWFAX AND SEE HOW HE IS HOUSED THESE PEOPLE ARE KINDLY TO BEASTS FOR THEY ARE A GOOD AND WISE FOLK BUT THEY HAVE LESS SKILL WITH HORSES THAN SOME
     WITH THAT GANDALF WENT OUT AND AS HE DID SO THERE CAME THE NOTE OF A CLEAR SWEET BELL RINGING IN A TOWER OF THE CITADEL THREE STROKES IT RANG LIKE SILVER IN THE AIR AND CEASED THE THIRD HOUR FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN
     AFTER A MINUTE PIPPIN WENT TO THE DOOR AND DOWN THE STAIR AND LOOKED ABOUT THE STREET THE SUN WAS NOW SHINING WARM AND BRIGHT AND THE TOWERS AND TALL HOUSES CAST LONG CLEARCUT SHADOWS WESTWARD HIGH IN THE BLUE AIR MOUNT MINDOLLUIN LIFTED ITS WHITE HELM AND SNOWY CLOAK ARMED MEN WENT TO AND FRO IN THE WAYS OF THE CITY AS IF GOING AT THE STRIKING OF THE HOUR TO CHANGES OF POST AND DUTY
     NINE OCLOCK WED CALL IT IN THE SHIRE SAID PIPPIN ALOUD TO HIMSELF JUST THE TIME FOR A NICE BREAKFAST BY THE OPEN WINDOW IN SPRING SUNSHINE AND HOW I SHOULD LIKE BREAKFAST DO THESE PEOPLE EVER HAVE IT OR IS IT OVER AND WHEN DO THEY HAVE DINNER AND WHERE
     PRESENTLY HE NOTICED A MAN CLAD IN BLACK AND WHITE COMING ALONG THE NARROW STREET FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CITADEL TOWARDS HIM PIPPIN FELT LONELY AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO SPEAK AS THE MAN PASSED BUT HE HAD NO NEED THE MAN CAME STRAIGHT UP TO HIM
     YOU ARE PEREGRIN THE HALFLING HE SAID I AM TOLD THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SWORN TO THE SERVICE OF THE LORD AND OF THE CITY WELCOME HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AND PIPPIN TOOK IT
     I AM NAMED BEREGOND SON OF BARANOR I HAVE NO DUTY THIS MORNING AND I HAVE BEEN SENT TO YOU TO TEACH YOU THE PASSWORDS AND TO TELL YOU SOME OF THE MANY THINGS THAT NO DOUBT YOU WILL WISH TO KNOW AND FOR MY PART I WOULD LEARN OF YOU ALSO FOR NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE SEEN A HALFLING IN THIS LAND AND THOUGH WE HAVE HEARD RUMOUR OF THEM LITTLE IS SAID OF THEM IN ANY TALE THAT WE KNOW MOREOVER YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MITHRANDIR DO YOU KNOW HIM WELL
     WELL SAID PIPPIN I HAVE KNOWN OF HIM ALL MY SHORT LIFE AS YOU MIGHT SAY AND LATELY I HAVE TRAVELLED FAR WITH HIM BUT THERE IS MUCH TO READ IN THAT BOOK AND I CANNOT CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN MORE THAN A PAGE OR TWO YET PERHAPS I KNOW HIM AS WELL AS ANY BUT A FEW ARAGORN WAS THE ONLY ONE OF OUR COMPANY I THINK WHO REALLY KNEW HIM
     ARAGORN SAID BEREGOND WHO IS HE
     OH STAMMERED PIPPIN HE WAS A MAN WHO WENT ABOUT WITH US I THINK HE IS IN ROHAN NOW
     YOU HAVE BEEN IN ROHAN I HEAR THERE IS MUCH THAT I WOULD ASK YOU OF THAT LAND ALSO FOR WE PUT MUCH OF WHAT LITTLE HOPE WE HAVE IN ITS PEOPLE BUT I AM FORGETTING MY ERRAND WHICH WAS FIRST TO ANSWER WHAT YOU WOULD ASK WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW MASTER PEREGRIN
     ER WELL SAID PIPPIN IF I MAY VENTURE TO SAY SO RATHER A BURNING QUESTION IN MY MIND AT PRESENT IS WELL WHAT ABOUT BREAKFAST AND ALL THAT I MEAN WHAT ARE THE MEALTIMES IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME AND WHERE IS THE DININGROOM IF THERE IS ONE AND THE INNS I LOOKED BUT NEVER A ONE COULD I SEE AS WE RODE UP THOUGH I HAD BEEN BORNE UP BY THE HOPE OF A DRAUGHT OF ALE AS SOON AS WE CAME TO THE HOMES OF WISE AND COURTLY MEN
     BEREGOND LOOKED AT HIM GRAVELY AN OLD CAMPAIGNER I SEE HE SAID THEY SAY THAT MEN WHO GO WARRING AFIELD LOOK EVER TO THE NEXT HOPE OF FOOD AND OF DRINK THOUGH I AM NOT A TRAVELLED MAN MYSELF THEN YOU HAVE NOT YET EATEN TODAY
     WELL YES TO SPEAK IN COURTESY YES SAID PIPPIN BUT NO MORE THAN A CUP OF WINE AND A WHITE CAKE OR TWO BY THE KINDNESS OF YOUR LORD BUT HE RACKED ME FOR IT WITH AN HOUR OF QUESTIONS AND THAT IS HUNGRY WORK
     BEREGOND LAUGHED AT THE TABLE SMALL MEN MAY DO THE GREATER DEEDS WE SAY BUT YOU HAVE BROKEN YOUR FAST AS WELL AS ANY MAN IN THE CITADEL AND WITH GREATER HONOUR THIS IS A FORTRESS AND A TOWER OF GUARD AND IS NOW IN POSTURE OF WAR WE RISE ERE THE SUN AND TAKE A MORSEL IN THE GREY LIGHT AND GO TO OUR DUTIES AT THE OPENING HOUR BUT DO NOT DESPAIR HE LAUGHED AGAIN SEEING THE DISMAY IN PIPPINS FACE THOSE WHO HAVE HAD HEAVY DUTY TAKE SOMEWHAT TO REFRESH THEIR STRENGTH IN THE MIDMORNING THEN THERE IS THE NUNCHEON AT NOON OR AFTER AS DUTIES ALLOW AND MEN GATHER FOR THE DAYMEAL AND SUCH MIRTH AS THERE STILL MAY BE ABOUT THE HOUR OF SUNSET
     COME WE WILL WALK A LITTLE AND THEN GO FIND US SOME REFRESHMENT AND EAT AND DRINK ON THE BATTLEMENT AND SURVEY THE FAIR MORNING
     ONE MOMENT SAID PIPPIN BLUSHING GREED OR HUNGER BY YOUR COURTESY PUT IT OUT OF MY MIND BUT GANDALF MITHRANDIR AS YOU CALL HIM ASKED ME TO SEE TO HIS HORSE  SHADOWFAX A GREAT STEED OF ROHAN AND THE APPLE OF THE KINGS EYE I AM TOLD THOUGH HE HAS GIVEN HIM TO MITHRANDIR FOR HIS SERVICES I THINK HIS NEW MASTER LOVES THE BEAST BETTER THAN HE LOVES MANY MEN AND IF HIS GOOD WILL IS OF ANY VALUE TO THIS CITY YOU WILL TREAT SHADOWFAX WITH ALL HONOUR WITH GREATER KINDNESS THAN YOU HAVE TREATED THIS HOBBIT IF IT IS POSSIBLE
     HOBBIT SAID BEREGOND
     THAT IS WHAT WE CALL OURSELVES SAID PIPPIN
     I AM GLAD TO LEARN IT SAID BEREGOND FOR NOW I MAY SAY THAT STRANGE ACCENTS DO NOT MAR FAIR SPEECH AND HOBBITS ARE A FAIRSPOKEN FOLK BUT COME YOU SHALL MAKE ME ACQUAINTED WITH THIS GOOD HORSE I LOVE BEASTS AND WE SEE THEM SELDOM IN THIS STONY CITY FOR MY PEOPLE CAME FROM THE MOUNTAINVALES AND BEFORE THAT FROM ITHILIEN BUT FEAR NOT THE VISIT SHALL BE SHORT A MERE CALL OF COURTESY AND WE WILL GO THENCE TO THE BUTTERIES
     PIPPIN FOUND THAT SHADOWFAX HAD BEEN WELL HOUSED AND TENDED FOR IN THE SIXTH CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITADEL THERE WERE SOME FAIR STABLES WHERE A FEW SWIFT HORSES WERE KEPT HARD BY THE LODGINGS OF THE ERRANDRIDERS OF THE LORD MESSENGERS ALWAYS READY TO GO AT THE URGENT COMMAND OF DENETHOR OR HIS CHIEF CAPTAINS BUT NOW ALL THE HORSES AND THE RIDERS WERE OUT AND AWAY
     SHADOWFAX WHINNIED AS PIPPIN ENTERED THE STABLE AND TURNED HIS HEAD GOOD MORNING SAID PIPPIN GANDALF WILL COME AS SOON AS HE MAY HE IS BUSY BUT HE SENDS GREETINGS AND I AM TO SEE THAT ALL IS WELL WITH YOU AND YOU RESTING I HOPE AFTER YOUR LONG LABOURS
     SHADOWFAX TOSSED HIS HEAD AND STAMPED BUT HE ALLOWED BEREGOND TO HANDLE HIS HEAD GENTLY AND STROKE HIS GREAT FLANKS
     HE LOOKS AS IF HE WERE SPOILING FOR A RACE AND NOT NEWLY COME FROM A GREAT JOURNEY SAID BEREGOND HOW STRONG AND PROUD HE IS WHERE IS HIS HARNESS IT SHOULD BE RICH AND FAIR
     NONE IS RICH AND FAIR ENOUGH FOR HIM SAID PIPPIN HE WILL HAVE NONE IF HE WILL CONSENT TO BEAR YOU BEAR YOU HE DOES AND IF NOT WELL NO BIT BRIDLE WHIP OR THONG WILL TAME HIM FAREWELL SHADOWFAX HAVE PATIENCE BATTLE IS COMING
     SHADOWFAX LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND NEIGHED SO THAT THE STABLE SHOOK AND THEY COVERED THEIR EARS THEN THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE SEEING THAT THE MANGER WAS WELL FILLED
     AND NOW FOR OUR MANGER SAID BEREGOND AND HE LED PIPPIN BACK TO THE CITADEL AND SO TO A DOOR IN THE NORTH SIDE OF THE GREAT TOWER THERE THEY WENT DOWN A LONG COOL STAIR INTO A WIDE ALLEY LIT WITH LAMPS THERE WERE HATCHES IN THE WALLS AT THE SIDE AND ONE OF THESE WAS OPEN
     THIS IS THE STOREHOUSE AND BUTTERY OF MY COMPANY OF THE GUARD SAID BEREGOND GREETINGS TARGON HE CALLED THROUGH THE HATCH IT IS EARLY YET BUT HERE IS A NEWCOMER THAT THE LORD HAS TAKEN INTO HIS SERVICE HE HAS RIDDEN LONG AND FAR WITH A TIGHT BELT AND HAS HAD SORE LABOUR THIS MORNING AND HE IS HUNGRY GIVE US WHAT YOU HAVE
     THEY GOT THERE BREAD AND BUTTER AND CHEESE AND APPLES THE LAST OF THE WINTER STORE WRINKLED BUT SOUND AND SWEET AND A LEATHER FLAGON OF NEWDRAWN ALE AND WOODEN PLATTERS AND CUPS THEY PUT ALL INTO A WICKER BASKET AND CLIMBED BACK INTO THE SUN AND BEREGOND BROUGHT PIPPIN TO A PLACE AT THE EAST END OF THE GREAT OUTTHRUST BATTLEMENT WHERE THERE WAS AN EMBRASURE IN THE WALLS WITH A STONE SEAT BENEATH THE SILL FROM THERE THEY COULD LOOK OUT ON THE MORNING OVER THE WORLD
     THEY ATE AND DRANK AND THEY TALKED NOW OF GONDOR AND ITS WAYS AND CUSTOMS NOW OF THE SHIRE AND THE STRANGE COUNTRIES THAT PIPPIN HAD SEEN AND EVER AS THEY TALKED BEREGOND WAS MORE AMAZED AND LOOKED WITH GREATER WONDER AT THE HOBBIT SWINGING HIS SHORT LEGS AS HE SAT ON THE SEAT OR STANDING TIPTOE UPON IT TO PEER OVER THE SILL AT THE LANDS BELOW
     I WILL NOT HIDE FROM YOU MASTER PEREGRIN SAID BEREGOND THAT TO US YOU LOOK ALMOST AS ONE OF OUR CHILDREN A LAD OF NINE SUMMERS OR SO AND YET YOU HAVE ENDURED PERILS AND SEEN MARVELS THAT FEW OF OUR GREYBEARDS COULD BOAST OF I THOUGHT IT WAS THE WHIM OF OUR LORD TO TAKE HIM A NOBLE PAGE AFTER THE MANNER OF THE KINGS OF OLD THEY SAY BUT I SEE THAT IT IS NOT SO AND YOU MUST PARDON MY FOOLISHNESS
     I DO SAID PIPPIN THOUGH YOU ARE NOT FAR WRONG I AM STILL LITTLE MORE THAN A BOY IN THE RECKONING OF MY OWN PEOPLE AND IT WILL BE FOUR YEARS YET BEFORE I COME OF AGE AS WE SAY IN THE SHIRE BUT DO NOT BOTHER ABOUT ME COME AND LOOK AND TELL ME WHAT I CAN SEE
     THE SUN WAS NOW CLIMBING AND THE MISTS IN THE VALE BELOW HAD BEEN DRAWN UP THE LAST OF THEM WERE FLOATING AWAY JUST OVERHEAD AS WISPS OF WHITE CLOUD BORNE ON THE STIFFENING BREEZE FROM THE EAST THAT WAS NOW FLAPPING AND TUGGING THE FLAGS AND WHITE STANDARDS OF THE CITADEL AWAY DOWN IN THE VALLEYBOTTOM FIVE LEAGUES OR SO AS THE EYE LEAPS THE GREAT RIVER COULD NOW BE SEEN GREY AND GLITTERING COMING OUT OF THE NORTHWEST AND BENDING IN A MIGHTY SWEEP SOUTH AND WEST AGAIN TILL IT WAS LOST TO VIEW IN A HAZE AND SHIMMER FAR BEYOND WHICH LAY THE SEA FIFTY LEAGUES AWAY
     PIPPIN COULD SEE ALL THE PELENNOR LAID OUT BEFORE HIM DOTTED INTO THE DISTANCE WITH FARMSTEADS AND LITTLE WALLS BARNS AND BYRES BUT NOWHERE COULD HE SEE ANY KINE OR OTHER BEASTS MANY ROADS AND TRACKS CROSSED THE GREEN FIELDS AND THERE WAS MUCH COMING AND GOING WAINS MOVING IN LINES TOWARDS THE GREAT GATE AND OTHERS PASSING OUT NOW AND AGAIN A HORSEMAN WOULD RIDE UP AND LEAP FROM THE SADDLE AND HASTEN INTO THE CITY BUT MOST OF THE TRAFFIC WENT OUT ALONG THE CHIEF HIGHWAY AND THAT TURNED SOUTH AND THEN BENDING SWIFTER THAN THE RIVER SKIRTED THE HILLS AND PASSED SOON FROM SIGHT IT WAS WIDE AND WELLPAVED AND ALONG ITS EASTERN EDGE RAN A BROAD GREEN RIDINGTRACK AND BEYOND THAT A WALL ON THE RIDE HORSEMEN GALLOPED TO AND FRO BUT ALL THE STREET SEEMED TO BE CHOKED WITH GREAT COVERED WAINS GOING SOUTH BUT SOON PIPPIN SAW THAT ALL WAS IN FACT WELLORDERED THE WAINS WERE MOVING IN THREE LINES ONE SWIFTER DRAWN BY HORSES ANOTHER SLOWER GREAT WAGGONS WITH FAIR HOUSINGS OF MANY COLOURS DRAWN BY OXEN AND ALONG THE WEST RIM OF THE ROAD MANY SMALLER CARTS HAULED BY TRUDGING MEN
     THAT IS THE ROAD TO THE VALES OF TUMLADEN AND LOSSARNACH AND THE MOUNTAINVILLAGES AND THEN ON TO LEBENNIN SAID BEREGOND THERE GO THE LAST OF THE WAINS THAT BEAR AWAY TO REFUGE THE AGED THE CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN THAT MUST GO WITH THEM THEY MUST ALL BE GONE FROM THE GATE AND THE ROAD CLEAR FOR A LEAGUE BEFORE NOON THAT WAS THE ORDER IT IS A SAD NECESSITY HE SIGHED FEW MAYBE OF THOSE NOW SUNDERED WILL MEET AGAIN AND THERE WERE ALWAYS TOO FEW CHILDREN IN THIS CITY BUT NOW THERE ARE NONE  SAVE SOME YOUNG LADS THAT WILL NOT DEPART AND MAY FIND SOME TASK TO DO MY OWN SON IS ONE OF THEM
     THEY FELL SILENT FOR A WHILE PIPPIN GAZED ANXIOUSLY EASTWARD AS IF AT ANY MOMENT HE MIGHT SEE THOUSANDS OF ORCS POURING OVER THE FIELDS WHAT CAN I SEE THERE HE ASKED POINTING DOWN TO THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT CURVE OF THE ANDUIN IS THAT ANOTHER CITY OR WHAT IS IT
     
     IT WAS A CITY SAID BEREGOND THE CHIEF CITY OF GONDOR OF WHICH THIS WAS ONLY A FORTRESS FOR THAT IS THE RUIN OF OSGILIATH ON EITHER SIDE OF ANDUIN WHICH OUR ENEMIES TOOK AND BURNED LONG AGO YET WE WON IT BACK IN THE DAYS OF THE YOUTH OF DENETHOR NOT TO DWELL IN BUT TO HOLD AS AN OUTPOST AND TO REBUILD THE BRIDGE FOR THE PASSAGE OF OUR ARMS AND THEN CAME THE FELL RIDERS OUT OF MINAS MORGUL
     THE BLACK RIDERS SAID PIPPIN OPENING HIS EYES AND THEY WERE WIDE AND DARK WITH AN OLD FEAR REAWAKENED
     YES THEY WERE BLACK SAID BEREGOND AND I SEE THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF THEM THOUGH YOU HAVE NOT SPOKEN OF THEM IN ANY OF YOUR TALES
     I KNOW OF THEM SAID PIPPIN SOFTLY BUT I WILL NOT SPEAK OF THEM NOW SO NEAR SO NEAR  HE BROKE OFF AND LIFTED HIS EYES ABOVE THE RIVER AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT ALL HE COULD SEE WAS A VAST AND THREATENING SHADOW PERHAPS IT WAS MOUNTAINS LOOMING ON THE VERGE OF SIGHT THEIR JAGGED EDGES SOFTENED BY WELLNIGH TWENTY LEAGUES OF MISTY AIR PERHAPS IT WAS BUT A CLOUDWALL AND BEYOND THAT AGAIN A YET DEEPER GLOOM BUT EVEN AS HE LOOKED IT SEEMED TO HIS EYES THAT THE GLOOM WAS GROWING AND GATHERING VERY SLOWLY SLOWLY RISING TO SMOTHER THE REGIONS OF THE SUN
     SO NEAR TO MORDOR SAID BEREGOND QUIETLY YES THERE IT LIES WE SELDOM NAME IT BUT WE HAVE DWELT EVER IN SIGHT OF THAT SHADOW SOMETIMES IT SEEMS FAINTER AND MORE DISTANT SOMETIMES NEARER AND DARKER IT IS GROWING AND DARKENING NOW AND THEREFORE OUR FEAR AND DISQUIET GROW TOO AND THE FELL RIDERS LESS THAN A YEAR AGO THEY WON BACK THE CROSSINGS AND MANY OF OUR BEST MEN WERE SLAIN BOROMIR IT WAS THAT DROVE THE ENEMY AT LAST BACK FROM THIS WESTERN SHORE AND WE HOLD STILL THE NEAR HALF OF OSGILIATH FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT WE AWAIT NOW A NEW ONSLAUGHT THERE MAYBE THE CHIEF ONSLAUGHT OF THE WAR THAT COMES
     WHEN SAID PIPPIN HAVE YOU A GUESS FOR I SAW THE BEACONS LAST NIGHT AND THE ERRANDRIDERS AND GANDALF SAID THAT IT WAS A SIGN THAT WAR HAD BEGUN HE SEEMED IN A DESPERATE HURRY BUT NOW EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE SLOWED UP AGAIN
     ONLY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS NOW READY SAID BEREGOND IT IS BUT THE DEEP BREATH BEFORE THE PLUNGE
     BUT WHY WERE THE BEACONS LIT LAST NIGHT
     IT IS OVERLATE TO SEND FOR AID WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY BESIEGED ANSWERED BEREGOND BUT I DO NOT KNOW THE COUNSEL OF THE LORD AND HIS CAPTAINS THEY HAVE MANY WAYS OF GATHERING NEWS AND THE LORD DENETHOR IS UNLIKE OTHER MEN HE SEES FAR SOME SAY THAT AS HE SITS ALONE IN HIS HIGH CHAMBER IN THE TOWER AT NIGHT AND BENDS HIS THOUGHT THIS WAY AND THAT HE CAN READ SOMEWHAT OF THE FUTURE AND THAT HE WILL AT TIMES SEARCH EVEN THE MIND OF THE ENEMY WRESTLING WITH HIM AND SO IT IS THAT HE IS OLD WORN BEFORE HIS TIME BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE MY LORD FARAMIR IS ABROAD BEYOND THE RIVER ON SOME PERILOUS ERRAND AND HE MAY HAVE SENT TIDINGS
     BUT IF YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT I THINK SET THE BEACONS ABLAZE IT WAS THE NEWS THAT CAME YESTEREVE OUT OF LEBENNIN THERE IS A GREAT FLEET DRAWING NEAR TO THE MOUTHS OF ANDUIN MANNED BY THE CORSAIRS OF UMBAR IN THE SOUTH THEY HAVE LONG CEASED TO FEAR THE MIGHT OF GONDOR AND THEY HAVE ALLIED THEM WITH THE ENEMY AND NOW MAKE A HEAVY STROKE IN HIS CAUSE FOR THIS ATTACK WILL DRAW OFF MUCH OF THE HELP THAT WE LOOKED TO HAVE FROM LEBENNIN AND BELFALAS WHERE FOLK ARE HARDY AND NUMEROUS ALL THE MORE DO OUR THOUGHTS GO NORTH TO ROHAN AND THE MORE GLAD ARE WE FOR THESE TIDINGS OF VICTORY THAT YOU BRING
     AND YET  HE PAUSED AND STOOD UP AND LOOKED ROUND NORTH EAST AND SOUTH  THE DOINGS AT ISENGARD SHOULD WARN US THAT WE ARE CAUGHT NOW IN A GREAT NET AND STRATEGY THIS IS NO LONGER A BICKERING AT THE FORDS RAIDING FROM ITHILIEN AND FROM ANLANNED AND WE ARE BUT ONE PIECE IN IT WHATEVER PRIDE MAY SAY THINGS MOVE IN THE FAR EAST BEYOND THE INLAND SEA IT IS REPORTED AND NORTH IN MIRKWOOD AND BEYOND AND SOUTH IN HARAD AND NOW ALL REALMS SHALL BE PUT TO THE TEST TO STAND OR FALL  UNDER THE SHADOW
     YET MASTER PEREGRIN WE HAVE THIS HONOUR EVER WE BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE CHIEF HATRED OF THE DARK LORD FOR THAT HATRED COMES DOWN OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF TIME AND OVER THE DEEPS OF THE SEA HERE WILL THE HAMMERSTROKE FALL HARDEST AND FOR THAT REASON MITHRANDIR CAME HITHER IN SUCH HASTE FOR IF WE FALL WHO SHALL STAND AND MASTER PEREGRIN DO YOU SEE ANY HOPE THAT WE SHALL STAND
     PIPPIN DID NOT ANSWER HE LOOKED AT THE GREAT WALLS AND THE TOWERS AND BRAVE BANNERS AND THE SUN IN THE HIGH SKY AND THEN AT THE GATHERING GLOOM IN THE EAST AND HE THOUGHT OF THE LONG FINGERS OF THAT SHADOW OF THE ORCS IN THE WOODS AND THE MOUNTAINS THE TREASON OF ISENGARD THE BIRDS OF EVIL EYE AND THE BLACK RIDERS EVEN IN THE LANES OF THE SHIRE  AND OF THE WINGED TERROR THE NAZGQUELLING CRUEL AND COLD HE BLANCHED AND COWERED AGAINST THE WALL
     WHAT WAS THAT ASKED BEREGOND YOU ALSO FELT SOMETHING
     YES MUTTERED PIPPIN IT IS THE SIGN OF OUR FALL AND THE SHADOW OF DOOM A FELL RIDER OF THE AIR
     YES THE SHADOW OF DOOM SAID BEREGOND I FEAR THAT MINAS TIRITH SHALL FALL NIGHT COMES THE VERY WARMTH OF MY BLOOD SEEMS STOLEN AWAY
     FOR A TIME THEY SAT TOGETHER WITH BOWED HEADS AND DID NOT SPEAK THEN SUDDENLY PIPPIN LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE SUN WAS STILL SHINING AND THE BANNERS STILL STREAMING IN THE BREEZE HE SHOOK HIMSELF IT IS PASSED HE SAID NO MY HEART WILL NOT YET DESPAIR GANDALF FELL AND HAS RETURNED AND IS WITH US WE MAY STAND IF ONLY ON ONE LEG OR AT LEAST BE LEFT STILL UPON OUR KNEES
     RIGHTLY SAID CRIED BEREGOND RISING AND STRIDING TO AND FRO NAY THOUGH ALL THINGS MUST COME UTTERLY TO AN END IN TIME GONDOR SHALL NOT PERISH YET NOT THOUGH THE WALLS BE TAKEN BY A RECKLESS FOE THAT WILL BUILD A HILL OF CARRION BEFORE THEM THERE ARE STILL OTHER FASTNESSES AND SECRET WAYS OF ESCAPE INTO THE MOUNTAINS HOPE AND MEMORY SHALL LIVE STILL IN SOME HIDDEN VALLEY WHERE THE GRASS IS GREEN
     ALL THE SAME I WISH IT WAS OVER FOR GOOD OR ILL SAID PIPPIN I AM NO WARRIOR AT ALL AND DISLIKE ANY THOUGHT OF BATTLE BUT WAITING ON THE EDGE OF ONE THAT I CANT ESCAPE IS WORST OF ALL WHAT A LONG DAY IT SEEMS ALREADY I SHOULD BE HAPPIER IF WE WERE NOT OBLIGED TO STAND AND WATCH MAKING NO MOVE STRIKING NOWHERE FIRST NO STROKE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK IN ROHAN I THINK BUT FOR GANDALF
     AH THERE YOU LAY YOUR FINGER ON THE SORE THAT MANY FEEL SAID BEREGOND BUT THINGS MAY CHANGE WHEN FARAMIR RETURNS HE IS BOLD MORE BOLD THAN MANY DEEM FOR IN THESE DAYS MEN ARE SLOW TO BELIEVE THAT A CAPTAIN CAN BE WISE AND LEARNED IN THE SCROLLS OF LORE AND SONG AS HE IS AND YET A MAN OF HARDIHOOD AND SWIFT JUDGEMENT IN THE FIELD BUT SUCH IS FARAMIR LESS RECKLESS AND EAGER THAN BOROMIR BUT NOT LESS RESOLUTE YET WHAT INDEED CAN HE DO WE CANNOT ASSAULT THE MOUNTAINS OF  OF YONDER REALM OUR REACH IS SHORTENED AND WE CANNOT STRIKE TILL SOME FOE COMES WITHIN IT THEN OUR HAND MUST BE HEAVY HE SMOTE THE HILT OF HIS SWORD
     PIPPIN LOOKED AT HIM TALL AND PROUD AND NOBLE AS ALL THE MEN THAT HE HAD YET SEEN IN THAT LAND AND WITH A GLITTER IN HIS EYE AS HE THOUGHT OF THE BATTLE ALAS MY OWN HAND FEELS AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER HE THOUGHT BUT HE SAID NOTHING A PAWN DID GANDALF SAY PERHAPS BUT ON THE WRONG CHESSBOARD
     SO THEY TALKED UNTIL THE SUN REACHED ITS HEIGHT AND SUDDENLY THE NOONBELLS WERE RUNG AND THERE WAS A STIR IN THE CITADEL FOR ALL SAVE THE WATCHMEN WERE GOING TO THEIR MEAL
     WILL YOU COME WITH ME SAID BEREGOND YOU MAY JOIN MY MESS FOR THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOW TO WHAT COMPANY YOU WILL BE ASSIGNED OR THE LORD MAY HOLD YOU AT HIS OWN COMMAND BUT YOU WILL BE WELCOME AND IT WILL BE WELL TO MEET AS MANY MEN AS YOU MAY WHILE THERE IS YET TIME
     I SHALL BE GLAD TO COME SAID PIPPIN I AM LONELY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I LEFT MY BEST FRIEND BEHIND IN ROHAN AND I HAVE HAD NO ONE TO TALK TO OR JEST WITH PERHAPS I COULD REALLY JOIN YOUR COMPANY ARE YOU THE CAPTAIN IF SO YOU COULD TAKE ME ON OR SPEAK FOR ME
     NAY NAY BEREGOND LAUGHED I AM NO CAPTAIN NEITHER OFFICE NOR RANK NOR LORDSHIP HAVE I BEING BUT A PLAIN MAN OF ARMS OF THE THIRD COMPANY OF THE CITADEL YET MASTER PEREGRIN TO BE ONLY A MAN OF ARMS OF THE GUARD OF THE TOWER OF GONDOR IS HELD WORTHY IN THE CITY AND SUCH MEN HAVE HONOUR IN THE LAND
     THEN IT IS FAR BEYOND ME SAID PIPPIN TAKE ME BACK TO OUR ROOM AND IF GANDALF IS NOT THERE I WILL GO WHERE YOU LIKE  AS YOUR GUEST
     GANDALF WAS NOT IN THE LODGING AND HAD SENT NO MESSAGE SO PIPPIN WENT WITH BEREGOND AND WAS MADE KNOWN TO THE MEN OF THE THIRD COMPANY AND IT SEEMED THAT BEREGOND GOT AS MUCH HONOUR FROM IT AS HIS GUEST FOR PIPPIN WAS VERY WELCOME THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN MUCH TALK IN THE CITADEL ABOUT MITHRANDIRS COMPANION AND HIS LONG CLOSETING WITH THE LORD AND RUMOUR DECLARED THAT A PRINCE OF THE HALFLINGS HAD COME OUT OF THE NORTH TO OFFER ALLEGIANCE TO GONDOR AND FIVE THOUSAND SWORDS AND SOME SAID THAT WHEN THE RIDERS CAME FROM ROHAN EACH WOULD BRING BEHIND HIM A HALFLING WARRIOR SMALL MAYBE BUT DOUGHTY
     THOUGH PIPPIN HAD REGRETFULLY TO DESTROY THIS HOPEFUL TALE HE COULD NOT BE RID OF HIS NEW RANK ONLY FITTING MEN THOUGHT TO ONE BEFRIENDED BY BOROMIR AND HONOURED BY THE LORD DENETHOR AND THEY THANKED HIM FOR COMING AMONG THEM AND HUNG ON HIS WORDS AND STORIES OF THE OUTLANDS AND GAVE HIM AS MUCH FOOD AND ALE AS HE COULD WISH INDEED HIS ONLY TROUBLE WAS TO BE WARY ACCORDING TO THE COUNSEL OF GANDALF AND NOT TO LET HIS TONGUE WAG FREELY AFTER THE MANNER OF A HOBBIT AMONG FRIENDS
     AT LENGTH BEREGOND ROSE FAREWELL FOR THIS TIME HE SAID I HAVE DUTY NOW TILL SUNDOWN AS HAVE ALL THE OTHERS HERE I THINK BUT IF YOU ARE LONELY AS YOU SAY MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE A MERRY GUIDE ABOUT THE CITY MY SON WOULD GO WITH YOU GLADLY A GOOD LAD I MAY SAY IF THAT PLEASES YOU GO DOWN TO THE LOWEST CIRCLE AND ASK FOR THE OLD GUESTHOUSE IN THE RATH CELERDAIN THE LAMPWRIGHTS STREET YOU WILL FIND HIM THERE WITH OTHER LADS THAT ARE REMAINING IN THE CITY THERE MAY BE THINGS WORTH SEEING DOWN AT THE GREAT GATE ERE THE CLOSING
     HE WENT OUT AND SOON AFTER ALL THE OTHERS FOLLOWED THE DAY WAS STILL FINE THOUGH IT WAS GROWING HAZY AND IT WAS HOT FOR MARCH EVEN SO FAR SOUTHWARDS PIPPIN FELT SLEEPY BUT THE LODGING SEEMED CHEERLESS AND HE DECIDED TO GO DOWN AND EXPLORE THE CITY HE TOOK A FEW MORSELS THAT HE HAD SAVED TO SHADOWFAX AND THEY WERE GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED THOUGH THE HORSE SEEMED TO HAVE NO LACK THEN HE WALKED ON DOWN MANY WINDING WAYS
     PEOPLE STARED MUCH AS HE PASSED TO HIS FACE MEN WERE GRAVELY COURTEOUS SALUTING HIM AFTER THE MANNER OF GONDOR WITH BOWED HEAD AND HANDS UPON THE BREAST BUT BEHIND HIM HE HEARD MANY CALLS AS THOSE OUT OF DOORS CRIED TO OTHERS WITHIN TO COME AND SEE THE PRINCE OF THE HALFLINGS THE COMPANION OF MITHRANDIR MANY USED SOME OTHER TONGUE THAN THE COMMON SPEECH BUT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE LEARNED AT LEAST WHAT WAS MEANT BY ERNIL I PHERIANNATH AND KNEW THAT HIS TITLE HAD GONE DOWN BEFORE HIM INTO THE CITY
     HE CAME AT LAST BY ARCHED STREETS AND MANY FAIR ALLEYS AND PAVEMENTS TO THE LOWEST AND WIDEST CIRCLE AND THERE HE WAS DIRECTED TO THE LAMPWRIGHTS STREET A BROAD WAY RUNNING TOWARDS THE GREAT GATE IN IT HE FOUND THE OLD GUESTHOUSE A LARGE BUILDING OF GREY WEATHERED STONE WITH TWO WINGS RUNNING BACK FROM THE STREET AND BETWEEN THEM A NARROW GREENSWARD BEHIND WHICH WAS THE MANYWINDOWED HOUSE FRONTED ALONG ITS WHOLE WIDTH BY A PILLARED PORCH AND A FLIGHT OF STEPS DOWN ON TO THE GRASS BOYS WERE PLAYING AMONG THE PILLARS THE ONLY CHILDREN THAT PIPPIN HAD SEEN IN MINAS TIRITH AND HE STOPPED TO LOOK AT THEM PRESENTLY ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND WITH A SHOUT HE SPRANG ACROSS THE GRASS AND CAME INTO THE STREET FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL OTHERS THERE HE STOOD IN FRONT OF PIPPIN LOOKING HIM UP AND DOWN
     GREETINGS SAID THE LAD WHERE DO YOU COME FROM YOU ARE A STRANGER IN THE CITY
     I WAS SAID PIPPIN BUT THEY SAY I HAVE BECOME A MAN OF GONDOR
     OH COME SAID THE LAD THEN WE ARE ALL MEN HERE BUT HOW OLD ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME I AM TEN YEARS ALREADY AND SHALL SOON BE FIVE FEET I AM TALLER THAN YOU BUT THEN MY FATHER IS A GUARD ONE OF THE TALLEST WHAT IS YOUR FATHER
     WHICH QUESTION SHALL I ANSWER FIRST SAID PIPPIN MY FATHER FARMS THE LANDS ROUND WHITWELL NEAR TUCKBOROUGH IN THE SHIRE I AM NEARLY TWENTYNINE SO I PASS YOU THERE THOUGH I AM BUT FOUR FEET AND NOT LIKELY TO GROW ANY MORE SAVE SIDEWAYS
     TWENTYNINE SAID THE LAD AND WHISTLED WHY YOU ARE QUITE OLD AS OLD AS MY UNCLE IORLAS STILL HE ADDED HOPEFULLY I WAGER I COULD STAND YOU ON YOUR HEAD OR LAY YOU ON YOUR BACK
     MAYBE YOU COULD IF I LET YOU SAID PIPPIN WITH A LAUGH AND MAYBE I COULD DO THE SAME TO YOU WE KNOW SOME WRESTLING TRICKS IN MY LITTLE COUNTRY WHERE LET ME TELL YOU I AM CONSIDERED UNCOMMONLY LARGE AND STRONG AND I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANYONE TO STAND ME ON MY HEAD SO IF IT CAME TO A TRIAL AND NOTHING ELSE WOULD SERVE I MIGHT HAVE TO KILL YOU FOR WHEN YOU ARE OLDER YOU WILL LEARN THAT FOLK ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM AND THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN ME FOR A SOFT STRANGERLAD AND EASY PREY LET ME WARN YOU I AM NOT I AM A HALFLING HARD BOLD AND WICKED PIPPIN PULLED SUCH A GRIM FACE THAT THE BOY STEPPED BACK A PACE BUT AT ONCE HE RETURNED WITH CLENCHED FISTS AND THE LIGHT OF BATTLE IN HIS EYE
     NO PIPPIN LAUGHED DONT BELIEVE WHAT STRANGERS SAY OF THEMSELVES EITHER I AM NOT A FIGHTER BUT IT WOULD BE POLITER IN ANY CASE FOR THE CHALLENGER TO SAY WHO HE IS
     THE BOY DREW HIMSELF UP PROUDLY I AM BERGIL SON OF BEREGOND OF THE GUARDS HE SAID
     SO I THOUGHT SAID PIPPIN FOR YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR FATHER I KNOW HIM AND HE SENT ME TO FIND YOU
     THEN WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO AT ONCE SAID BERGIL AND SUDDENLY A LOOK OF DISMAY CAME OVER HIS FACE DO NOT TELL ME THAT HE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND AND WILL SEND ME AWAY WITH THE MAIDENS BUT NO THE LAST WAINS HAVE GONE
     HIS MESSAGE IS LESS BAD THAN THAT IF NOT GOOD SAID PIPPIN HE SAYS THAT IF YOU WOULD PREFER IT TO STANDING ME ON MY HEAD YOU MIGHT SHOW ME ROUND THE CITY FOR A WHILE AND CHEER MY LONELINESS I CAN TELL YOU SOME TALES OF FAR COUNTRIES IN RETURN
     BERGIL CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND LAUGHED WITH RELIEF ALL IS WELL HE CRIED COME THEN WE WERE SOON GOING TO THE GATE TO LOOK ON WE WILL GO NOW

     THAT IS GOOD SAID BERGIL WE BOYS ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO PASS THE GATE WITHOUT AN ELDER NOW WE SHALL SEE BETTER
     BEYOND THE GATE THERE WAS A CROWD OF MEN ALONG THE VERGE OF THE ROAD AND OF THE GREAT PAVED SPACE INTO WHICH ALL THE WAYS TO MINAS TIRITH RAN ALL EYES WERE TURNED SOUTHWARDS AND SOON A MURMUR ROSE THERE IS DUST AWAY THERE THEY ARE COMING
     PIPPIN AND BERGIL EDGED THEIR WAY FORWARD TO THE FRONT OF THE CROWD AND WAITED HORNS SOUNDED AT SOME DISTANCE AND THE NOISE OF CHEERING ROLLED TOWARDS THEM LIKE A GATHERING WIND THEN THERE WAS A LOUD TRUMPETBLAST AND ALL ABOUT THEM PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING
     FORLONG FORLONG PIPPIN HEARD MEN CALLING WHAT DO THEY SAY HE ASKED

     SO IT WILL IF I HAVE NOT RETURNED BEFORE THE SUNDOWNBELLS SAID BERGIL COME THERE GOES THE TRUMPET FOR THE CLOSING OF THE GATE
     HAND IN HAND THEY WENT BACK INTO THE CITY THE LAST TO PASS THE GATE BEFORE IT WAS SHUT AND AS THEY REACHED THE LAMPWRIGHTS STREET ALL THE BELLS IN THE TOWERS TOLLED SOLEMNLY LIGHTS SPRANG IN MANY WINDOWS AND FROM THE HOUSES AND WARDS OF THE MEN AT ARMS ALONG THE WALLS THERE CAME THE SOUND OF SONG
     FAREWELL FOR THIS TIME SAID BERGIL TAKE MY GREETINGS TO MY FATHER AND THANK HIM FOR THE COMPANY THAT HE SENT COME AGAIN SOON I BEG ALMOST I WISH NOW THAT THERE WAS NO WAR FOR WE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME MERRY TIMES WE MIGHT HAVE JOURNEYED TO LOSSARNACH TO MY GRANDSIRES HOUSE IT IS GOOD TO BE THERE IN SPRING THE WOODS AND FIELDS ARE FULL OF FLOWERS BUT MAYBE WE WILL GO THITHER TOGETHER YET THEY WILL NEVER OVERCOME OUR LORD AND MY FATHER IS VERY VALIANT FAREWELL AND RETURN

      CHAPTER 2
      THE PASSING OF THE GREY COMPANY
     

     GANDALF WAS GONE AND THE THUDDING HOOFS OF SHADOWFAX WERE LOST IN THE NIGHT WHEN MERRY CAME BACK TO ARAGORN HE HAD ONLY A LIGHT BUNDLE FOR HE HAD LOST HIS PACK AT PARTH GALEN AND ALL HE HAD WAS A FEW USEFUL THINGS HE HAD PICKED UP AMONG THE WRECKAGE OF ISENGARD HASUFEL WAS ALREADY SADDLED LEGOLAS AND GIMLI WITH THEIR HORSE STOOD CLOSE BY
     SO FOUR OF THE COMPANY STILL REMAIN SAID ARAGORN WE WILL RIDE ON TOGETHER BUT WE SHALL NOT GO ALONE AS I THOUGHT THE KING IS NOW DETERMINED TO SET OUT AT ONCE SINCE THE COMING OF THE WINGED SHADOW HE DESIRES TO RETURN TO THE HILLS UNDER COVER OF NIGHT
     AND THEN WHITHER SAID LEGOLAS
     I CANNOT SAY YET ARAGORN ANSWERED AS FOR THE KING HE WILL GO TO THE MUSTER THAT HE COMMANDED AT EDORAS FOUR NIGHTS FROM NOW AND THERE I THINK HE WILL HEAR TIDINGS OF WAR AND THE RIDERS OF ROHAN WILL GO DOWN TO MINAS TIRITH BUT FOR MYSELF AND ANY THAT WILL GO WITH ME
     I FOR ONE CRIED LEGOLAS AND GIMLI WITH HIM SAID THE DWARF
     WELL FOR MYSELF SAID ARAGORN IT IS DARK BEFORE ME I MUST GO DOWN ALSO TO MINAS TIRITH BUT I DO NOT YET SEE THE ROAD AN HOUR LONG PREPARED APPROACHES
     DONT LEAVE ME BEHIND SAID MERRY I HAVE NOT BEEN OF MUCH USE YET BUT I DONT WANT TO BE LAID ASIDE LIKE BAGGAGE TO BE CALLED FOR WHEN ALL IS OVER I DONT THINK THE RIDERS WILL WANT TO BE BOTHERED WITH ME NOW THOUGH OF COURSE THE KING DID SAY THAT I WAS TO SIT BY HIM WHEN HE CAME TO HIS HOUSE AND TELL HIM ALL ABOUT THE SHIRE
     YES SAID ARAGORN AND YOUR ROAD LIES WITH HIM I THINK MERRY BUT DO NOT LOOK FOR MIRTH AT THE ENDING IT WILL BE LONG I FEAR ERE TH
     SOON ALL WERE READY TO DEPART TWENTYFOUR HORSES WITH GIMLI BEHIND LEGOLAS AND MERRY IN FRONT OF ARAGORN PRESENTLY THEY WERE RIDING SWIFTLY THROUGH THE NIGHT THEY HAD NOT LONG PASSED THE MOUNDS AT THE FORDS OF ISEN WHEN A RIDER GALLOPED UP FROM THE REAR OF THEIR LINE
     MY LORD HE SAID TO THE KING THERE ARE HORSEMEN BEHIND US AS WE CROSSED THE FORDS I THOUGHT THAT I HEARD THEM NOW WE ARE SURE THEY ARE OVERTAKING US RIDING HARD
     THE WAS A FIGHT WHAT HE SHOULD DO SUPPOSING THE KINGS SMALL ESCORT WAS TRAPPED AND OVERCOME BUT HE ESCAPED INTO THE DARKNESS  ALONE IN THE WILD FIELDS OF ROHAN WITH NO IDEA OF WHERE HE WAS IN ALL THE ENDLESS MILES NO GOOD HE THOUGHT HE DREW HIS SWORD AND TIGHTENED HIS BELT
     THE SINKING MOON WAS OBSCURED BY A GREAT SAILING CLOUD BUT SUDDENLY IT RODE OUT CLEAR AGAIN THEN THEY ALL HEARD THE SOUND OF HOOFS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT THEY SAW DARK SHAPES COMING SWIFTLY ON THE PATH FROM THE FORDS THE MOONLIGHT GLINTED HERE AND THERE ON THE POINTS OF SPEARS THE NUMBER OF THE PURSUERS COULD NOT BE TOLD BUT THEY SEEMED NO FEWER THAN THE KINGS ESCORT AT THE LEAST
     WHEN THEY WERE SOME FIFTY PACES OFF 
     THE PURSUERS BROUGHT THEIR STEEDS TO A SUDDEN STAND A SILENCE FOLLOWED AND THEN IN THE MOONLIGHT A HORSEMAN COULD BE SEEN DISMOUNTING AND WALKING SLOWLY FORWARD HIS HAND SHOWED WHITE AS HE HELD IT UP PALM OUTWARD IN TOKEN OF PEACE BUT THE KINGS MEN GRIPPED THEIR WEAPONS AT TEN PACES THE MAN STOPPED HE WAS TALL A DARK STANDING SHADOW THEN HIS CLEAR VOICE RANG OUT
     ROHAN ROHAN DID YOU SAY THAT IS A GLAD WORD WE SEEK THAT LAND IN HASTE FROM LONG AFAR
     YOU HAVE FOUND IT SAID 
     HALBARAD DUNADAN RANGER OF THE NORTH I AM CRIED THE MAN WE SEEK ONE ARAGORN SON OF ARATHORN AND WE HEARD THAT HE WAS IN ROHAN
     AND YOU HAVE FOUND HIM ALSO CRIED ARAGORN GIVING HIS REINS TO MERRY HE RAN FORWARD AND EMBRACED THE NEWCOMER HALBARAD HE SAID OF ALL JOYS THIS IS THE LEAST EXPECTED
     MERRY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS SOME LAST TRICK OF SARUMANS TO WAYLAY THE KING WHILE HE HAD ONLY A FEW MEN ABOUT HIM BUT IT SEEMED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO DIE IN TH
     ALL IS WELL SAID ARAGORN TURNING BACK HERE ARE SOME OF MY OWN KIN FROM THE FAR LAND WHERE I DWELT BUT WHY THEY COME AND HOW MANY THEY BE HALBARAD SHALL TELL US
     I HAVE THIRTY WITH ME SAID HALBARAD THAT IS ALL OF OUR KINDRED THAT COULD BE GATHERED IN HASTE BUT THE BRETHREN ELLADAN AND ELROHIR HAVE RIDDEN WITH US DESIRING TO GO TO THE WAR WE RODE AS SWIFTLY AS WE MIGHT WHEN YOUR SUMMONS CAME
     BUT I DID NOT SUMMON YOU SAID ARAGORN SAVE ONLY IN WISH MY THOUGHTS HAVE OFTEN TURNED TO YOU AND SELDOM MORE THAN TONIGHT YET I HAVE SENT NO WORD BUT COME ALL SUCH MATTERS MUST WAIT YOU FIND US RIDING IN HASTE AND DANGER RIDE WITH US NOW IF THE KING WILL GIVE HIS LEAVE
     TH
     THEN THE RIDERS SET OUT AGAIN AND ARAGORN FOR A WHILE RODE WITH THE DUNEDAIN AND WHEN THEY HAD SPOKEN OF TIDINGS IN THE NORTH AND IN THE SOUTH ELROHIR SAID TO HIM
     I BRING WORD TO YOU FROM MY FATHER THE DAYS ARE SHORT IF THOU ART IN HASTE REMEMBER THE PATHS OF THE DEAD
     ALWAYS MY DAYS HAVE SEEMED TO ME TOO SHORT TO ACHIEVE MY DESIRE ANSWERED ARAGORN BUT GREAT INDEED WILL BE MY HASTE ERE I TAKE THAT ROAD

     NOW THS AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW ARAGORN RODE TO THE DIKE AND WATCHED TILL THE KINGS MEN WERE FAR DOWN THE COOMB THEN HE TURNED TO HALBARAD
     THERE GO THREE THAT I LOVE AND THE SMALLEST NOT THE LEAST HE SAID HE KNOWS NOT TO WHAT END HE RIDES YET IF HE KNEW HE STILL WOULD GO ON

     TOGETHER THEY WENT BACK INTO THE BURG YET FOR SOME TIME ARAGORN SAT SILENT AT THE TABLE IN THE HALL AND THE OTHERS WAITED FOR HIM TO SPEAK COME SAID LEGOLAS AT LAST SPEAK AND BE COMFORTED AND SHAKE OFF THE SHADOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE WE CAME BACK TO THIS GRIM PLACE IN THE GREY MORNING
     A STRUGGLE SOMEWHAT GRIMMER FOR MY PART THAN THE BATTLE OF THE HORNBURG ANSWERED ARAGORN I HAVE LOOKED IN THE STONE OF ORTHANC MY FRIENDS
     YOU HAVE LOOKED IN THAT ACCURSED STONE OF WIZARDRY EXCLAIMED GIMLI WITH FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT IN HIS FACE DID YOU SAY AUGHT TO  HIM EVEN GANDALF FEARED THAT ENCOUNTER
     YOU FORGET TO WHOM YOU SPEAK SAID ARAGORN STERNLY AND HIS EYES GLINTED DID I NOT OPENLY PROCLAIM MY TITLE BEFORE THE DOORS OF EDORAS WHAT DO YOU FEAR THAT I SHOULD SAY TO HIM NAY GIMLI HE SAID IN A SOFTER VOICE AND THE GRIMNESS LEFT HIS FACE AND HE LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO HAS LABOURED IN SLEEPLESS PAIN FOR MANY NIGHTS NAY MY FRIENDS I AM THE LAWFUL MASTER OF THE STONE AND I HAD BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE STRENGTH TO USE IT OR SO I JUDGED THE RIGHT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THE STRENGTH WAS ENOUGH  BARELY
     HE DREW A DEEP BREATH IT WAS A BITTER STRUGGLE AND THE WEARINESS IS SLOW TO PASS I SPOKE NO WORD TO HIM AND IN THE END I WRENCHED THE STONE TO MY OWN WILL THAT ALONE HE WILL FIND HARD TO ENDURE AND HE BEHELD ME YES MASTER GIMLI HE SAW ME BUT IN OTHER GUISE THAN YOU SEE ME HERE IF THAT WILL AID HIM THEN I HAVE DONE ILL BUT I DO NOT THINK SO TO KNOW THAT I LIVED AND WALKED THE EARTH WAS A BLOW TO HIS HEART I DEEM FOR HE KNEW IT NOT TILL NOW THE EYES IN ORTHANC DID NOT SEE THROUGH THE ARMOUR OF TH
     BUT HE WIELDS GREAT DOMINION NONETHELESS SAID GIMLI AND NOW HE WILL STRIKE MORE SWIFTLY
     THE HASTY STROKE GOES OFT ASTRAY SAID ARAGORN WE MUST PRESS OUR ENEMY AND NO LONGER WAIT UPON HIM FOR THE MOVE SEE MY FRIENDS WHEN I HAD MASTERED THE STONE I LEARNED MANY THINGS A GRAVE PERIL I SAW COMING UNLOOKEDFOR UPON GONDOR FROM THE SOUTH THAT WILL DRAW OFF GREAT STRENGTH FROM THE DEFENCE OF MINAS TIRITH IF IT IS NOT COUNTERED SWIFTLY I DEEM THAT THE CITY WILL BE LOST ERE TEN DAYS BE GONE
     THEN LOST IT MUST BE SAID GIMLI FOR WHAT HELP IS THERE TO SEND THITHER AND HOW COULD IT COME THERE IN TIME
     I HAVE NO HELP TO SEND THEREFORE I MUST GO MYSELF SAID ARAGORN BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS THAT WILL BRING ME TO THE COASTLANDS BEFORE ALL IS LOST THAT IS THE PATHS OF THE DEAD
     THE PATHS OF THE DEAD SAID GIMLI IT IS A FELL NAME AND LITTLE TO THE LIKING TO THE MEN OF ROHAN AS I SAW CAN THE LIVING USE SUCH A ROAD AND NOT PERISH AND EVEN IF YOU PASS THAT WAY WHAT WILL SO FEW AVAIL TO COUNTER THE STROKES OF MORDOR
     THE LIVING HAVE NEVER USED THAT ROAD SINCE THE COMING OF THE ROHIRRIM SAID ARAGORN FOR IT IS CLOSED TO THEM BUT IN THIS DARK HOUR THE HEIR OF ISILDUR MAY USE IT IF HE DARE LISTEN THIS IS THE WORD THAT THE SONS OF ELROND BRING TO ME FROM THEIR FATHER IN RIVENDELL WISEST IN LORE BID ARAGORN REMEMBER THE WORDS OF THE SEER AND THE PATHS OF THE DEAD
     AND WHAT MAY BE THE WORDS OF THE SEER SAID LEGOLAS
     THUS SPOKE MALBETH THE SEER IN THE DAYS OF ARVEDUI LAST KING AT FORNOST SAID ARAGORN
     
      
       OVER THE LAND THERE LIES A LONG SHADOW

       WESTWARD REACHING WINGS OF DARKNESS

       THE TOWER TREMBLES TO THE TOMBS OF KINGS

       DOOM APPROACHES THE DEAD AWAKEN

       FOR THE HOUR IS COME FOR THE OATHBREAKERS

       AT THE STONE OF ERECH THEY SHALL STAND AGAIN

       AND HEAR THERE A HORN IN THE HILLS RINGING

       WHOSE SHALL THE HORN BE WHO SHALL CALL THEM

       FROM THE PREY TWILIGHT THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE

       THE HEIR OF HIM TO WHOM THE OATH THEY SWORE

       FROM THE NORTH SHALL HE COME NEED SHALL DRIVE HIM

       HE SHALL PASS THE DOOR TO THE PATHS OF THE DEAD

      

     
     DARK WAYS DOUBTLESS SAID GIMLI BUT NO DARKER THAN THESE STAVES ARE TO ME
     IF YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THEM BETTER THEN I BID YOU COME WITH ME SAID ARAGORN FOR THAT WAY I NOW SHALL TAKE BUT I DO NOT GO GLADLY ONLY NEED DRIVES ME THEREFORE ONLY OF YOUR FREE WILL WOULD I HAVE YOU COME FOR YOU WILL FIND BOTH TOIL AND GREAT FEAR AND MAYBE WORSE
     I WILL GO WITH YOU EVEN ON THE PATHS OF THE DEAD AND TO WHATEVER END THEY MAY LEAD SAID GIMLI
     I ALSO WILL COME SAID LEGOLAS FOR I DO NOT FEAR THE DEAD
     I HOPE THAT THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FIGHT SAID GIMLI FOR OTHERWISE I SEE NOT WHY WE SHOULD TROUBLE THEM
     THAT WE SHALL KNOW IF EVER WE COME TO ERECH SAID ARAGORN BUT THE OATH THAT THEY BROKE WAS TO FIGHT AGAINST SAURON AND THEY MUST FIGHT THEREFORE IF THEY ARE TO FULFIL IT FOR AT ERECH THERE STANDS YET A BLACK STONE THAT WAS BROUGHT IT WAS SAID FROM NRSHIPPED SAURON IN THE DARK YEARS
     THEN ISILDUR SAID TO THEIR KING THOU SHALT BE THE LAST KING AND IF THE WEST PROVE MIGHTIER THAN THY BLACK MASTER THIS CURSE I LAY UPON THEE AND THY FOLK TO REST NEVER UNTIL YOUR OATH IS FULFILLED FOR THIS WAR WILL LAST THROUGH YEARS UNCOUNTED AND YOU SHALL BE SUMMONED ONCE AGAIN ERE THE END AND THEY FLED BEFORE THE WRATH OF ISILDUR AND DID NOT DARE TO GO FORTH TO WAR ON SAURONS PART AND THEY HID THEMSELVES IN SECRET PLACES IN THE MOUNTAINS AND HAD NO DEALINGS WITH OTHER MEN BUT SLOWLY DWINDLED IN THE BARREN HILLS AND THE TERROR OF THE SLEEPLESS DEAD LIES ABOUT THE HILL OF ERECH AND ALL PLACES WHERE THAT PEOPLE LINGERED BUT THAT WAY I MUST GO SINCE THERE ARE NONE LIVING TO HELP ME
     HE STOOD UP COME HE CRIED AND DREW HIS SWORD AND IT FLASHED IN THE TWILIT HALL OF THE BURG TO THE STONE OF ERECH I SEEK THE PATHS OF THE DEAD COME WITH ME WHO WILL
     LEGOLAS AND GIMLI MADE NO ANSWER BUT THEY ROSE AND FOLLOWED ARAGORN FROM THE HALL ON THE GREEN THERE WAITED STILL AND SILENT THE HOODED RANGERS LEGOLAS AND GIMLI MOUNTED ARAGORN SPRANG UPON ROHERYN THEN HALBARAD LIFTED A GREAT HORN AND THE BLAST OF IT ECHOED IN HELMS DEEP AND WITH THAT THEY LEAPT AWAY RIDING DOWN THE COOMB LIKE THUNDER WHILE ALL THE MEN THAT WERE LEFT ON DIKE OR BURG STARED IN AMAZE
     AND WHILE TH
     THE LADY CERNING WHICH ONLY HASTY TIDINGS HAD YET REACHED HER AND WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE BATTLE IN HELMS DEEP AND THE GREAT SLAUGHTER OF THEIR FOES AND OF THE CHARGE OF TH
     BUT AT LAST SHE SAID LORDS YOU ARE WEARY AND SHALL NOW GO TO YOUR BEDS WITH SUCH EASE AS CAN BE CONTRIVED IN HASTE BUT TOMORROW FAIRER HOUSING SHALL BE FOUND FOR YOU
     BUT ARAGORN SAID NAY LADY BE NOT TROUBLED FOR US IF WE MAY LIE HERE TONIGHT AND BREAK OUR FAST TOMORROW IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR I RIDE ON AN ERRAND MOST URGENT AND WITH THE FIRST LIGHT OF MORNING WE MUST GO
     SHE SMILED ON HIM AND SAID THEN IT WAS KINDLY DONE LORD TO RIDE SO MANY MILES OUT OF YOUR WAY TO BRING TIDINGS TO 
     INDEED NO MAN WOULD COUNT SUCH A JOURNEY WASTED SAID ARAGORN AND YET LADY I COULD NOT HAVE COME HITHER IF IT WERE NOT THAT THE ROAD WHICH I MUST TAKE LEADS ME TO DUNHARROW
     AND SHE ANSWERED AS ONE THAT LIKES NOT WHAT IS SAID THEN LORD YOU ARE ASTRAY FOR OUT OF HARROWDALE NO ROAD RUNS EAST OR SOUTH AND YOU HAD BEST RETURN AS YOU CAME
     NAY LADY SAID HE I AM NOT ASTRAY FOR I WALKED IN THIS LAND ERE YOU WERE BORN TO GRACE IT THERE IS A ROAD OUT OF THIS VALLEY AND THAT ROAD I SHALL TAKE TOMORROW I SHALL RIDE BY THE PATHS OF THE DEAD
     THEN SHE STARED AT HIM AS ONE THAT IS STRICKEN AND HER FACE BLANCHED AND FOR LONG SHE SPOKE NO MORE WHILE ALL SAT SILENT BUT ARAGORN SHE SAID AT LAST IS IT THEN YOUR ERRAND TO SEEK DEATH FOR THAT IS ALL THAT YOU WILL FIND ON THAT ROAD THEY DO NOT SUFFER THE LIVING TO PASS
     THEY MAY SUFFER ME TO PASS SAID ARAGORN BUT AT THE LEAST I WILL ADVENTURE IT NO OTHER ROAD WILL SERVE
     BUT THIS IS MADNESS SHE SAID FOR HERE ARE MEN OF RENOWN AND PROWESS WHOM YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE INTO THE SHADOWS BUT SHOULD LEAD TO WAR WHERE MEN ARE NEEDED I BEG YOU TO REMAIN AND RIDE WITH MY BROTHER FOR THEN ALL OUR HEARTS WILL BE GLADDENED AND OUR HOPE BE THE BRIGHTER
     IT IS NOT MADNESS LADY HE ANSWERED FOR I GO ON A PATH APPOINTED BUT THOSE WHO FOLLOW ME DO SO OF THEIR FREE WILL AND IF THEY WISH NOW TO REMAIN AND RIDE WITH THE ROHIRRIM THEY MAY DO SO BUT I SHALL TAKE THE PATHS OF THE DEAD ALONE IF NEEDS BE
     THEN THEY SAID NO MORE AND THEY ATE IN SILENCE BUT HER EYES WERE EVER UPON ARAGORN AND THE OTHERS SAW THAT SHE WAS IN GREAT TORMENT OF MIND AT LENGTH THEY AROSE AND TOOK THEIR LEAVE OF THE LADY AND THANKED HER FOR HER CARE AND WENT TO THEIR REST
     BUT AS ARAGORN CAME TO THE BOOTH WHERE HE WAS TO LODGE WITH LEGOLAS AND GIMLI AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD GONE IN THERE CAME THE LADY 
     ARAGORN SHE SAID WHY WILL YOU GO ON THIS DEADLY ROAD
     BECAUSE I MUST HE SAID ONLY SO CAN I SEE ANY HOPE OF DOING MY PART IN THE WAR AGAINST SAURON I DO NOT CHOOSE PATHS OF PERIL 
     FOR A WHILE SHE WAS SILENT AS IF PONDERING WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN THEN SUDDENLY SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM YOU ARE A STERN LORD AND RESOLUTE SHE SAID AND THUS DO MEN WIN RENOWN SHE PAUSED LORD SHE SAID IF YOU MUST GO THEN LET ME RIDE IN YOUR FOLLOWING FOR I AM WEARY OF SKULKING IN THE HILLS AND WISH TO FACE PERIL AND BATTLE
     YOUR DUTY IS WITH YOUR PEOPLE HE ANSWERED
     TOO OFTEN HAVE I HEARD OF DUTY SHE CRIED BUT AM I NOT OF THE HOUSE OF EORL A SHIELDMAIDEN AND NOT A DRYNURSE I HAVE WAITED ON FALTERING FEET LONG ENOUGH SINCE THEY FALTER NO LONGER IT SEEMS MAY I NOT NOW SPEND MY LIFE AS I WILL
     FEW MAY DO THAT WITH HONOUR HE ANSWERED BUT AS FOR YOU LADY DID YOU NOT ACCEPT THE CHARGE TO GOVERN THE PEOPLE UNTIL THEIR LORDS RETURN IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN CHOSEN THEN SOME MARSHAL OR CAPTAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN SET IN THE SAME PLACE AND HE COULD NOT RIDE AWAY FROM HIS CHARGE WERE HE WEARY OF IT OR NO
     SHALL I ALWAYS BE CHOSEN SHE SAID BITTERLY SHALL I ALWAYS BE LEFT BEHIND WHEN THE RIDERS DEPART TO MIND THE HOUSE WHILE THEY WIN RENOWN AND FIND FOOD AND BEDS WHEN THEY RETURN
     A TIME MAY COME SOON SAID HE WHEN NONE WILL RETURN THEN THERE WILL BE NEED OF VALOUR WITHOUT RENOWN FOR NONE SHALL REMEMBER THE DEEDS THAT ARE DONE IN THE LAST DEFENCE OF YOUR HOMES YET THE DEEDS WILL NOT BE LESS VALIANT BECAUSE THEY ARE UNPRAISED
     AND SHE ANSWERED ALL YOUR WORDS ARE BUT TO SAY YOU ARE A WOMAN AND YOUR PART IS IN THE HOUSE BUT WHEN THE MEN HAVE DIED IN BATTLE AND HONOUR YOU HAVE LEAVE TO BE BURNED IN THE HOUSE FOR THE MEN WILL NEED IT NO MORE BUT I AM OF THE HOUSE OF EORL AND NOT A SERVINGWOMAN I CAN RIDE AND WIELD BLADE AND I DO NOT FEAR EITHER PAIN OR DEATH
     WHAT DO YOU FEAR LADY HE ASKED
     A CAGE SHE SAID TO STAY BEHIND BARS UNTIL USE AND OLD AGE ACCEPT THEM AND ALL CHANCE OF DOING GREAT DEEDS IS GONE BEYOND RECALL OR DESIRE
     AND YET YOU COUNSELLED ME NOT TO ADVENTURE ON THE ROAD THAT I HAD CHOSEN BECAUSE IT IS PERILOUS
     SO MAY ONE COUNSEL ANOTHER SHE SAID YET I DO NOT BID YOU FLEE FROM PERIL BUT TO RIDE TO BATTLE WHERE YOUR SWORD MAY WIN RENOWN AND VICTORY I WOULD NOT SEE A THING THAT IS HIGH AND EXCELLENT CAST AWAY NEEDLESSLY
     NOR WOULD I HE SAID THEREFORE I SAY TO YOU LADY STAY FOR YOU HAVE NO ERRAND TO THE SOUTH
     NEITHER HAVE THOSE OTHERS WHO GO WITH THEE THEY GO ONLY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BE PARTED FROM THEE  BECAUSE THEY LOVE THEE THEN SHE TURNED AND VANISHED INTO THE NIGHT
     WHEN THE LIGHT OF DAY WAS COME INTO THE SKY BUT THE SUN WAS NOT YET RISEN ABOVE THE HIGH RIDGES IN THE EAST ARAGORN MADE READY TO DEPART HIS COMPANY WAS ALL MOUNTED AND HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAP INTO THE SADDLE WHEN THE LADY OUR HOUSE AND OF YOU AND OF ALL YOUR PEOPLE SAY TO YOUR BROTHER BEYOND THE SHADOWS WE MAY MEET AGAIN
     
     THEN IT SEEMED TO GIMLI AND LEGOLAS WHO WERE NEARBY THAT SHE WEPT AND IN ONE SO STERN AND PROUD THAT SEEMED THE MORE GRIEVOUS BUT SHE SAID ARAGORN WILT THOU GO
     I WILL HE SAID
     THEN WILT THOU NOT LET ME RIDE WITH THIS COMPANY AS I HAVE ASKED
     I WILL NOT LADY HE SAID FOR THAT I COULD NOT GRANT WITHOUT LEAVE OF THE KING AND OF YOUR BROTHER AND THEY WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL TOMORROW BUT I COUNT NOW EVERY HOUR INDEED EVERY MINUTE FAREWELL
     THEN SHE FELL ON HER KNEES SAYING I BEG THEE
     NAY LADY HE SAID AND TAKING HER BY THE HAND HE RAISED HER THEN HE KISSED HER HAND AND SPRANG INTO THE SADDLE AND RODE AWAY AND DID NOT LOOK BACK AND ONLY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM WELL AND WERE NEAR TO HIM SAW THE PAIN THAT HE BORE
     BUT ENT BACK TO HER LODGING BUT NONE OF HER FOLK SAW THIS PARTING FOR THEY HID THEMSELVES IN FEAR AND WOULD NOT COME FORTH UNTIL THE DAY WAS UP AND THE RECKLESS STRANGERS WERE GONE
     AND SOME SAID THEY ARE ELVISH WIGHTS LET THEM GO WHERE THEY BELONG INTO THE DARK PLACES AND NEVER RETURN THE TIMES ARE EVIL ENOUGH
     THE LIGHT WAS STILL GREY AS THEY RODE FOR THE SUN HAD NOT YET CLIMBED OVER THE BLACK RIDGES OF THE HAUNTED MOUNTAIN BEFORE THEM A DREAD FELL ON THEM EVEN AS THEY PASSED BETWEEN THE LINES OF ANCIENT STONES AND SO CAME TO THE DIMHOLT THERE UNDER THE GLOOM OF BLACK TREES THAT NOT EVEN LEGOLAS COULD LONG ENDURE THEY FOUND A HOLLOW PLACE OPENING AT THE MOUNTAINS ROOT AND RIGHT IN THEIR PATH STOOD A SINGLE MIGHTY STONE LIKE A FINGER OF DOOM
     MY BLOOD RUNS CHILL SAID GIMLI BUT THE OTHERS WERE SILENT AND HIS VOICE FELL DEAD ON THE DANK FIRNEEDLES AT HIS FEET THE HORSES WOULD NOT PASS THE THREATENING STONE UNTIL THE RIDERS DISMOUNTED AND LED THEM ABOUT AND SO THEY CAME AT LAST DEEP INTO THE GLEN AND THERE STOOD A SHEER WALL OF ROCK AND IN THE WALL THE DARK DOOR GAPED BEFORE THEM LIKE THE MOUTH OF NIGHT SIGNS AND FIGURES WERE CARVED ABOVE ITS WIDE ARCH TOO DIM TO READ AND FEAR FLOWED FROM IT LIKE A GREY VAPOUR
     THE COMPANY HALTED AND THERE WAS NOT A HEART AMONG THEM THAT DID NOT QUAIL UNLESS IT WERE THE HEART OF LEGOLAS OF THE ELVES FOR WHOM THE GHOSTS OF MEN HAVE NO TERROR
     THIS IS AN EVIL DOOR SAID HALBARAD AND MY DEATH LIES BEYOND IT I WILL DARE TO PASS IT NONETHELESS BUT NO HORSE WILL ENTER
     BUT WE MUST GO IN AND THEREFORE THE HORSES MUST GO TOO SAID ARAGORN FOR IF EVER WE COME THROUGH THIS DARKNESS MANY LEAGUES LIE BEYOND AND EVERY HOUR THAT IS LOST THERE WILL BRING THE TRIUMPH OF SAURON NEARER FOLLOW ME
     THEN ARAGORN LED THE WAY AND SUCH WAS THE STRENGTH OF HIS WILL IN THAT HOUR THAT ALL THE DUNEDAIN AND THEIR HORSES FOLLOWED HIM AND INDEED THE LOVE THAT THE HORSES OF THE RANGERS BORE FOR THEIR RIDERS WAS SO GREAT THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO FACE EVEN THE TERROR OF THE DOOR IF THEIR MASTERS HEARTS WERE STEADY AS THEY WALKED BESIDE THEM BUT AROD THE HORSE OF ROHAN REFUSED THE WAY AND HE STOOD SWEATING AND TREMBLING IN A FEAR THAT WAS GRIEVOUS TO SEE THEN LEGOLAS LAID HIS HANDS ON HIS EYES AND SANG SOME WORDS THAT WENT SOFT IN THE GLOOM UNTIL HE SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE LED AND LEGOLAS PASSED IN AND THERE STOOD GIMLI THE DWARF LEFT ALL ALONE
     HIS KNEES SHOOK AND HE WAS WROTH WITH HIMSELF HERE IS A THING UNHEARD OF HE SAID AN ELF WILL GO UNDERGROUND AND A DWARF DARE NOT WITH THAT HE PLUNGED IN BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE DRAGGED HIS FEET LIKE LEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD AND AT ONCE A BLINDNESS CAME UPON HIM EVEN UPON GIMLI GL
     ARAGORN HAD BROUGHT TORCHES FROM DUNHARROW AND NOW HE WENT AHEAD BEARING ONE ALOFT AND ELLADAN WITH ANOTHER WENT AT THE REAR AND GIMLI STUMBLING BEHIND STROVE TO OVERTAKE HIM HE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE DIM FLAME OF THE TORCHES BUT IF THE COMPANY HALTED THERE SEEMED AN ENDLESS WHISPER OF VOICES ALL ABOUT HIM A MURMUR OF WORDS IN NO TONGUE THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE
     NOTHING ASSAILED THE COMPANY NOR WITHSTOOD THEIR PASSAGE AND YET STEADILY FEAR GREW ON THE DWARF AS HE WENT ON MOST OF ALL BECAUSE HE KNEW NOW THAT THERE COULD BE NO TURNING BACK ALL THE PATHS BEHIND WERE THRONGED BY AN UNSEEN HOST THAT FOLLOWED IN THE DARK
     SO TIME UNRECKONED PASSED UNTIL GIMLI SAW A SIGHT THAT HE WAS EVER AFTERWARDS LOTH TO RECALL THE ROAD WAS WIDE AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE BUT NOW THE COMPANY CAME SUDDENLY INTO A GREAT EMPTY SPACE AND THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY WALLS UPON EITHER SIDE THE DREAD WAS SO HEAVY ON HIM THAT HE COULD HARDLY WALK AWAY TO THE LEFT SOMETHING GLITTERED IN THE GLOOM AS ARAGORNS TORCH DREW NEAR THEN ARAGORN HALTED AND WENT TO LOOK WHAT IT MIGHT BE
     DOES HE FEEL NO FEAR MUTTERED THE DWARF IN ANY OTHER CAVE GIMLI GL
     NONETHELESS HE DREW NEAR AND SAW ARAGORN KNEELING WHILE ELLADAN HELD ALOFT BOTH TORCHES BEFORE HIM WERE THE BONES OF A MIGHTY MAN HE HAD BEEN CLAD IN MAIL AND STILL HIS HARNESS LAY THERE WHOLE FOR THE CAVERNS AIR WAS AS DRY AS DUST AND HIS HAUBERK WAS GILDED HIS BELT WAS OF GOLD AND GARNETS AND RICH WITH GOLD WAS THE HELM UPON HIS BONY HEAD FACE DOWNWARD ON THE FLOOR HE HAD FALLEN NEAR THE FAR WALL OF THE CAVE AS NOW COULD BE SEEN AND BEFORE HIM STOOD A STONY DOOR CLOSED FAST HIS FINGERBONES WERE STILL CLAWING AT THE CRACKS A NOTCHED AND BROKEN SWORD LAY BY HIM AS IF HE HAD HEWN AT THE ROCK IN HIS LAST DESPAIR
     ARAGORN DID NOT TOUCH HIM BUT AFTER GAZING SILENTLY FOR A WHILE HE ROSE AND SIGHED HITHER SHALL THE FLOWERS OF SIMBELMYNE COME NEVER UNTO WORLDS END HE MURMURED NINE MOUNDS AND SEVEN THERE ARE NOW GREEN WITH GRASS AND THROUGH ALL THE LONG YEARS HE HAS LAIN AT THE DOOR THAT HE COULD NOT UNLOCK WHITHER DOES IT LEAD WHY WOULD HE PASS NONE SHALL EVER KNOW
     FOR THAT IS NOT MY ERRAND HE CRIED TURNING BACK AND SPEAKING TO THE WHISPERING DARKNESS BEHIND KEEP YOUR HOARDS AND YOUR SECRETS HIDDEN IN THE ACCURSED YEARS SPEED ONLY WE ASK LET US PASS AND THEN COME I SUMMON YOU TO THE STONE OF ERECH
     THERE WAS NO ANSWER UNLESS IT WERE AN UTTER SILENCE MORE DREADFUL THAN THE WHISPERS BEFORE AND THEN A CHILL BLAST CAME IN WHICH THE TORCHES FLICKERED AND WENT OUT AND COULD NOT BE REKINDLED OF THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED ONE HOUR OR MANY GIMLI REMEMBERED LITTLE THE OTHERS PRESSED ON BUT HE WAS EVER HINDMOST PURSUED BY A GROPING HORROR THAT SEEMED ALWAYS JUST ABOUT TO SEIZE HIM AND A RUMOUR CAME AFTER HIM LIKE THE SHADOWSOUND OF MANY FEET HE STUMBLED ON UNTIL HE WAS CRAWLING LIKE A BEAST ON THE GROUND AND FELT THAT HE COULD ENDURE NO MORE HE MUST EITHER FIND AN ENDING AND ESCAPE OR RUN BACK IN MADNESS TO MEET THE FOLLOWING FEAR
     SUDDENLY HE HEARD THE TINKLE OF WATER A SOUND HARD AND CLEAR AS A STONE FALLING INTO A DREAM OF DARK SHADOW LIGHT GREW AND LO THE COMPANY PASSED THROUGH ANOTHER GATEWAY HIGHARCHED AND BROAD AND A RILL RAN OUT BESIDE THEM AND BEYOND GOING STEEPLY DOWN WAS A ROAD BETWEEN SHEER CLIFFS KNIFEEDGED AGAINST THE SKY FAR ABOVE SO DEEP AND NARROW WAS THAT CHASM THAT THE SKY WAS DARK AND IN IT SMALL STARS GLINTED YET AS GIMLI AFTER LEARNED IT WAS STILL TWO HOURS ERE SUNSET OF THE DAY ON WHICH THEY HAD SET OUT FROM DUNHARROW THOUGH FOR ALL THAT HE COULD THEN TELL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWILIGHT IN SOME LATER YEAR OR IN SOME OTHER WORLD
     THE COMPANY NOW MOUNTED AGAIN AND GIMLI RETURNED TO LEGOLAS THEY RODE IN FILE AND EVENING CAME ON AND A DEEP BLUE DUSK AND STILL FEAR PURSUED THEM LEGOLAS TURNING TO SPEAK TO GIMLI LOOKED BACK AND THE DWARF SAW BEFORE HIS FACE THE GLITTER IN THE ELFS BRIGHT EYES BEHIND THEM RODE ELLADAN LAST OF THE COMPANY BUT NOT THE LAST OF THOSE THAT TOOK THE DOWNWARD ROAD
     THE DEAD ARE FOLLOWING SAID LEGOLAS I SEE SHAPES OF MEN AND OF HORSES AND PALE BANNERS LIKE SHREDS OF CLOUD AND SPEARS LIKE WINTERTHICKETS ON A MISTY NIGHT THE DEAD ARE FOLLOWING
     YES THE DEAD RIDE BEHIND THEY HAVE BEEN SUMMONED SAID ELLADAN
     THE COMPANY CAME AT LAST OUT OF THE RAVINE AS SUDDENLY AS IT THEY HAD ISSUED FROM A CRACK IN A WALL AND THERE LAY THE UPLANDS OF A GREAT VALE BEFORE THEM AND THE STREAM BESIDE THEM WENT DOWN WITH A COLD VOICE OVER MANY FALLS
     WHERE IN MIDDLEEARTH ARE WE SAID GIMLI AND ELLADAN ANSWERED WE HAVE DESCENDED FROM THE UPRISING OF THE MORTHOND THE LONG CHILL RIVER THAT FLOWS AT LAST TO THE SEA THAT WASHES THE WALLS OF DOL AMROTH YOU WILL NOT NEED TO ASK HEREAFTER HOW COMES ITS NAME BLACKROOT MEN CALL IT
     THE MORTHOND VALE MADE A GREAT BAY THAT BEAT UP AGAINST THE SHEER SOUTHERN FACES OF THE MOUNTAINS ITS STEEP SLOPES WERE GRASSGROWN BUT ALL WAS GREY IN THAT HOUR FOR THE SUN HAD GONE AND FAR BELOW LIGHTS TWINKLED IN THE HOMES OF MEN THE VALE WAS RICH AND MANY FOLK DWELT THERE
     THEN WITHOUT TURNING ARAGORN CRIED ALOUD SO THAT ALL COULD HEAR FRIENDS FORGET YOUR WEARINESS RIDE NOW RIDE WE MUST COME TO THE STONE OF ERECH ERE THIS DAY PASSES AND LONG STILL IS THE WAY SO WITHOUT LOOKING BACK THEY RODE THE MOUNTAINFIELDS UNTIL THEY CAME TO A BRIDGE OVER THE GROWING TORRENT AND FOUND A ROAD THAT WENT DOWN INTO THE LAND
     LIGHTS WENT OUT IN HOUSE AND HAMLET AS THEY CAME AND DOORS WERE SHUT AND FOLK THAT WERE AFIELD CRIED IN TERROR AND RAN WILD LIKE HUNTED DEER EVER THERE ROSE THE SAME CRY IN THE GATHERING NIGHT THE KING OF THE DEAD THE KING OF THE DEAD IS COME UPON US
     BELLS WERE RINGING FAR BELOW AND ALL MEN FLED BEFORE THE FACE OF ARAGORN BUT THE GREY COMPANY IN THEIR HASTE RODE LIKE HUNTERS UNTIL THEIR HORSES WERE STUMBLING WITH WEARINESS AND THUS JUST ERE MIDNIGHT AND IN A DARKNESS AS BLACK AS THE CAVERNS IN THE MOUNTAINS THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE HILL OF ERECH
     LONG HAD THE TERROR OF THE DEAD LAIN UPON THAT HILL AND UPON THE EMPTY FIELDS ABOUT IT FOR UPON THE TOP STOOD A BLACK STONE ROUND AS A GREAT GLOBE THE HEIGHT OF A MAN THOUGH ITS HALF WAS BURIED IN THE GROUND UNEARTHLY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY AS SOME BELIEVED BUT THOSE WHO REMEMBERED STILL THE LORE OF WESTERNESSE TOLD THAT IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT OUT OF THE RUIN OF N
     TO THAT STONE THE COMPANY CAME AND HALTED IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT THEN ELROHIR GAVE TO ARAGORN A SILVER HORN AND HE BLEW UPON IT AND IT SEEMED TO THOSE THAT STOOD NEAR THAT THEY HEARD A SOUND OF ANSWERING HORNS AS IF IT WAS AN ECHO IN DEEP CAVES FAR AWAY NO OTHER SOUND THEY HEARD AND YET THEY WERE AWARE OF A GREAT HOST GATHERED ALL ABOUT THE HILL ON WHICH THEY STOOD AND A CHILL WIND LIKE THE BREATH OF GHOSTS CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS BUT ARAGORN DISMOUNTED AND STANDING BY THE STONE HE CRIED IN A GREAT VOICE
     OATHBREAKERS WHY HAVE YE COME
     AND A VOICE WAS HEARD OUT OF THE NIGHT THAT ANSWERED HIM AS IF FROM FAR AWAY
     TO FULFIL OUR OATH AND HAVE PEACE
     THEN ARAGORN SAID THE HOUR IS COME AT LAST NOW I GO TO PELARGIR UPON ANDUIN AND YE SHALL COME AFTER ME AND WHEN ALL THIS LAND IS CLEAN OF THE SERVANTS OF SAURON I WILL HOLD THE OATH FULFILLED AND YE SHALL HAVE PEACE AND DEPART FOR EVER FOR I AM ELESSAR ISILDURS HEIR OF GONDOR
     AND WITH THAT HE BADE HALBARAD UNFURL THE GREAT STANDARD WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT AND BEHOLD IT WAS BLACK AND IF THERE WAS ANY DEVICE UPON IT IT WAS HIDDEN IN THE DARKNESS THEN THERE WAS SILENCE AND NOT A WHISPER NOR A SIGH WAS HEARD AGAIN ALL THE LONG NIGHT THE COMPANY CAMPED BESIDE THE STONE BUT THEY SLEPT LITTLE BECAUSE OF THE DREAD OF THE SHADOWS THAT HEDGED THEM ROUND
     BUT WHEN THE DAWN CAME COLD AND PALE ARAGORN ROSE AT ONCE AND HE LED THE COMPANY FORTH UPON THE JOURNEY OF GREATEST HASTE AND WEARINESS THAT ANY AMONG THEM HAD KNOWN SAVE HE ALONE AND ONLY HIS WILL HELD THEM TO GO ON NO OTHER MORTAL MEN COULD HAVE ENDURED IT NONE BUT THE DUNEDAIN OF THE NORTH AND WITH THEM GIMLI THE DWARF AND LEGOLAS OF THE ELVES
     THEY PASSED TARLANGS NECK AND CAME INTO LAMEDON AND THE SHADOW HOST PRESSED BEHIND AND FEAR WENT ON BEFORE THEM UNTIL THEY CAME TO CALEMBEL UPON CIRIL AND THE SUN WENT DOWN LIKE BLOOD BEHIND PINNATH GELIN AWAY IN THE WEST BEHIND THEM THE TOWNSHIP AND THE FORDS OF CIRIL THEY FOUND DESERTED FOR MANY MEN HAD GONE AWAY TO WAR AND ALL THAT WERE LEFT FLED TO THE HILLS AT THE RUMOUR OF THE COMING OF THE KING OF THE DEAD BUT THE NEXT DAY THERE CAME NO DAWN AND THE GREY COMPANY PASSED ON INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE STORM OF MORDOR AND WERE LOST TO MORTAL SIGHT BUT THE DEAD FOLLOWED THEM
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 3
      THE MUSTER OF ROHAN
     

     NOW ALL ROADS WERE RUNNING TOGETHER TO THE EAST TO MEET THE COMING OF WAR AND THE ONSET OF THE SHADOW AND EVEN AS PIPPIN STOOD AT THE GREAT GATE OF THE CITY AND SAW THE PRINCE OF DOL AMROTH RIDE IN WITH HIS BANNERS THE KING OF ROHAN CAME DOWN OUT OF THE HILLS
     DAY WAS WANING IN THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN THE RIDERS CAST LONG POINTED SHADOWS THAT WENT ON BEFORE THEM DARKNESS HAD ALREADY CREPT BENEATH THE MURMURING FIRWOODS THAT CLOTHED THE STEEP MOUNTAINSIDES THE KING RODE NOW SLOWLY AT THE END OF THE DAY PRESENTLY THE PATH TURNED ROUND A HUGE BARE SHOULDER OF ROCK AND PLUNGED INTO THE GLOOM OF SOFTSIGHING TREES DOWN DOWN THEY WENT IN A LONG WINDING FILE WHEN AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GORGE THEY FOUND THAT EVENING HAD FALLEN IN THE DEEP PLACES THE SUN WAS GONE TWILIGHT LAY UPON THE WATERFALLS
     ALL DAY FAR BELOW THEM A LEAPING STREAM HAD RUN DOWN FROM THE HIGH PASS BEHIND CLEAVING ITS NARROW WAY BETWEEN PINECLAD WALLS AND NOW THROUGH A STONY GATE IT FLOWED OUT AND PASSED INTO A WIDER VALE THE RIDERS FOLLOWED IT AND SUDDENLY HARROWDALE LAY BEFORE THEM LOUD WITH THE NOISE OF WATERS IN THE EVENING THERE THE WHITE SNOWBOURN JOINED BY THE LESSER STREAM WENT RUSHING FUMING ON THE STONES DOWN TO EDORAS AND THE GREEN HILLS AND THE PLAINS AWAY TO THE RIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE GREAT DALE THE MIGHTY STARKHORN LOOMED UP ABOVE ITS VAST BUTTRESSES SWATHED IN CLOUD BUT ITS JAGGED PEAK CLOTHED IN EVERLASTING SNOW GLEAMED FAR ABOVE THE WORLD BLUESHADOWED UPON THE EAST REDSTAINED BY THE SUNSET IN THE WEST
     MERRY LOOKED OUT IN WONDER UPON THIS STRANGE COUNTRY OF WHICH HE HAD HEARD MANY TALES UPON THEIR LONG ROAD IT WAS A SKYLESS WORLD IN WHICH HIS EYE THROUGH DIM GULFS OF SHADOWY AIR SAW ONLY EVERMOUNTING SLOPES GREAT WALLS OF STONE BEHIND GREAT WALLS AND FROWNING PRECIPICES WREATHED WITH MIST HE SAT FOR A MOMENT HALF DREAMING LISTENING TO THE NOISE OF WATER THE WHISPER OF DARK TREES THE CRACK OF STONE AND THE VAST WAITING SILENCE THAT BROODED BEHIND ALL SOUND HE LOVED MOUNTAINS OR HE HAD LOVED THE THOUGHT OF THEM MARCHING ON THE EDGE OF STORIES BROUGHT FROM FAR AWAY BUT NOW HE WAS BORNE DOWN BY THE INSUPPORTABLE WEIGHT OF MIDDLEEARTH HE LONGED TO SHUT OUT THE IMMENSITY IN A QUIET ROOM BY A FIRE
     HE WAS VERY TIRED FOR THOUGH THEY HAD RIDDEN SLOWLY THEY HAD RIDDEN WITH VERY LITTLE REST HOUR AFTER HOUR FOR NEARLY THREE WEARY DAYS HE HAD JOGGED UP AND DOWN OVER PASSES AND THROUGH LONG DALES AND ACROSS MANY STREAMS SOMETIMES WHERE THE WAY WAS BROADER HE HAD RIDDEN AT THE KINGS SIDE NOT NOTICING THAT MANY OF THE RIDERS SMILED TO SEE THE TWO TOGETHER THE HOBBIT ON HIS LITTLE SHAGGY GREY PONY AND THE LORD OF ROHAN ON HIS GREAT WHITE HORSE THEN HE HAD TALKED TO THEECH OF ROHAN THAT HE HEARD THE MEN BEHIND HIM USING IT WAS A LANGUAGE IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE MANY WORDS THAT HE KNEW THOUGH SPOKEN MORE RICHLY AND STRONGLY THAN IN THE SHIRE YET HE COULD NOT PIECE THE WORDS TOGETHER AT TIMES SOME RIDER WOULD LIFT UP HIS CLEAR VOICE IN STIRRING SONG AND MERRY FELT HIS HEART LEAP THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
     ALL THE SAME HE HAD BEEN LONELY AND NEVER MORE SO THAN NOW AT THE DAYS END HE WONDERED WHERE IN ALL THIS STRANGE WORLD PIPPIN HAD GOT TO AND WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS AND GIMLI THEN SUDDENLY LIKE A COLD TOUCH ON HIS HEART HE THOUGHT OF FRODO AND SAM I AM FORGETTING THEM HE SAID TO HIMSELF REPROACHFULLY AND YET THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE REST OF US AND I CAME TO HELP THEM BUT NOW THEY MUST BE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY IF THEY ARE STILL ALIVE HE SHIVERED
     HARROWDALE AT LAST SAID 
     THIS JOURNEY IS OVER MAYBE SAID TH
     BUT IF YOU WOULD TAKE MY COUNSEL SAID 
     TH IF THE WAR IS LOST WHAT GOOD WILL BE MY HIDING IN THE HILLS AND IF IT IS WON WHAT GRIEF WILL IT BE EVEN IF I FALL SPENDING MY LAST STRENGTH BUT WE WILL LEAVE THIS NOW TONIGHT I WILL LIE IN THE HOLD OF DUNHARROW ONE EVENING OF PEACE AT LEAST IS LEFT US LET US RIDE ON
     IN THE DEEPENING DUSK THEY CAME DOWN INTO THE VALLEY HERE THE SNOWBOURN FLOWED NEAR TO THE WESTERN WALLS OF THE DALE AND SOON THE PATH LED THEM TO A FORD WHERE THE SHALLOW WATERS MURMURED LOUDLY ON THE STONES THE FORD WAS GUARDED AS THE KING APPROACHED MANY MEN SPRANG UP OUT OF THE SHADOW OF THE ROCKS AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING THEY CRIED WITH GLAD VOICES TH
     THEN ONE BLEW A LONG CALL ON A HORN IT ECHOED IN THE VALLEY OTHER HORNS ANSWERED IT AND LIGHTS SHONE OUT ACROSS THE RIVER
     AND SUDDENLY THERE ROSE A GREAT CHORUS OF TRUMPETS FROM HIGH ABOVE SOUNDING FROM SOME HOLLOW PLACE AS IT SEEMED THAT GATHERED THEIR NOTES INTO ONE VOICE AND SENT IT ROLLING AND BEATING ON THE WALLS OF STONE
     SO THE KING OF THE MARK CAME BACK VICTORIOUS OUT OF THE WEST TO DUNHARROW BENEATH THE FEET OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS THERE HE FOUND THE REMAINING STRENGTH OF HIS PEOPLE ALREADY ASSEMBLED FOR AS SOON AS HIS COMING WAS KNOWN CAPTAINS RODE TO MEET HIM AT THE FORD BEARING MESSAGES FROM GANDALF DUNHERE CHIEFTAIN OF THE FOLK OF HARROWDALE WAS AT THEIR HEAD
     AT DAWN THREE DAYS AGO LORD HE SAID SHADOWFAX CAME LIKE A WIND OUT OF THE WEST TO EDORAS AND GANDALF BROUGHT TIDINGS OF YOUR VICTORY TO GLADDEN OUR HEARTS BUT HE BROUGHT ALSO WORD FROM YOU TO HASTEN THE GATHERING OF THE RIDERS AND THEN CAME THE WINGED SHADOW
     THE WINGED SHADOW SAID TH
     MAYBE LORD SAID DUNHERE YET THE SAME OR ANOTHER LIKE TO IT A FLYING DARKNESS IN THE SHAPE OF A MONSTROUS BIRD PASSED OVER EDORAS THAT MORNING AND ALL MEN WERE SHAKEN WITH FEAR FOR IT STOOPED UPON MEDUSELD AND AS IT CAME LOW ALMOST TO THE GABLE THERE CAME A CRY THAT STOPPED OUR HEARTS THEN IT WAS THAT GANDALF COUNSELLED US NOT TO ASSEMBLE IN THE FIELDS BUT TO MEET YOU HERE IN THE VALLEY UNDER THE MOUNTAINS AND HE BADE US TO KINDLE NO MORE LIGHTS OR FIRES THAN BAREST NEED ASKED SO IT HAS BEEN DONE GANDALF SPOKE WITH GREAT AUTHORITY WE TRUST THAT IT IS AS YOU WOULD WISH NAUGHT HAS BEEN SEEN IN HARROWDALE OF THESE EVIL THINGS
     IT IS WELL SAID TH
     THE ROAD NOW LED EASTWARD STRAIGHT ACROSS THE VALLEY WHICH WAS AT THAT POINT LITTLE MORE THAN HALF A MILE IN WIDTH FLATS AND MEADS OF ROUGH GRASS GREY NOW IN THE FALLING NIGHT LAY ALL ABOUT BUT IN FRONT ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE DALE MERRY SAW A FROWNING WALL A LAST OUTLIER OF THE GREAT ROOTS OF THE STARKHORN CLOVEN BY THE RIVER IN AGES PAST
     ON ALL THE LEVEL SPACES THERE WAS GREAT CONCOURSE OF MEN SOME THRONGED TO THE ROADSIDE HAILING THE KING AND THE RIDERS FROM THE WEST WITH GLAD CRIES BUT STRETCHING AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE BEHIND THERE WERE ORDERED ROWS OF TENTS AND BOOTHS AND LINES OF PICKETED HORSES AND GREAT STORE OF ARMS AND PILED SPEARS BRISTLING LIKE THICKETS OF NEWPLANTED TREES NOW ALL THE GREAT ASSEMBLY WAS FALLING INTO SHADOW AND YET THOUGH THE NIGHTCHILL BLEW COLD FROM THE HEIGHTS NO LANTERNS GLOWED NO FIRES WERE LIT WATCHMEN HEAVILY CLOAKED PACED TO AND FRO
     MERRY WONDERED HOW MANY RIDERS THERE WERE HE COULD NOT GUESS THEIR NUMBER IN THE GATHERING GLOOM BUT IT LOOKED TO HIM LIKE A GREAT ARMY MANY THOUSANDS STRONG WHILE HE WAS PEERING FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE KINGS PARTY CAME UP UNDER THE LOOMING CLIFF ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE VALLEY AND THERE SUDDENLY THE PATH BEGAN TO CLIMB AND MERRY LOOKED UP IN AMAZEMENT HE WAS ON A ROAD THE LIKE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE A GREAT WORK OF MENS HANDS IN YEARS BEYOND THE REACH OF SONG UPWARDS IT WOUND COILING LIKE A SNAKE BORING ITS WAY ACROSS THE SHEER SLOPE OF ROCK STEEP AS A STAIR IT LOOPED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AS IT CLIMBED UP IT HORSES COULD WALK AND WAINS COULD BE SLOWLY HAULED BUT NO ENEMY COULD COME THAT WAY EXCEPT OUT OF THE AIR IF IT WAS DEFENDED FROM ABOVE AT EACH TURN OF THE ROAD THERE WERE GREAT STANDING STONES THAT HAD BEEN CARVED IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN HUGE AND CLUMSYLIMBED SQUATTING CROSSLEGGED WITH THEIR STUMPY ARMS FOLDED ON FAT BELLIES SOME IN THE WEARING OF THE YEARS HAD LOST ALL FEATURES SAVE THE DARK HOLES OF THEIR EYES THAT STILL STARED SADLY AT THE PASSERSBY THE RIDERS HARDLY GLANCED AT THEM THE PUKELMEN THEY CALLED THEM AND HEEDED THEM LITTLE NO POWER OR TERROR WAS LEFT IN THEM BUT MERRY GAZED AT THEM WITH WONDER AND A FEELING ALMOST OF PITY AS THEY LOOMED UP MOURNFULLY IN THE DUSK
     
     AFTER A WHILE HE LOOKED BACK AND FOUND THAT HE HAD ALREADY CLIMBED SOME HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY BUT STILL FAR BELOW HE COULD DIMLY SEE A WINDING LINE OF RIDERS CROSSING THE FORD AND FILING ALONG THE ROAD TOWARDS THE CAMP PREPARED FOR THEM ONLY THE KING AND HIS GUARD WERE GOING UP INTO THE HOLD
     AT LAST THE KINGS COMPANY CAME TO A SHARP BRINK AND THE CLIMBING ROAD PASSED INTO A CUTTING BETWEEN WALLS OF ROCK AND SO WENT UP A SHORT SLOPE AND OUT ON TO A WIDE UPLAND THE FIRIENFELD MEN CALLED IT A GREEN MOUNTAINFIELD OF GRASS AND HEATH HIGH ABOVE THE DEEPDELVED COURSES OF THE SNOWBOURN LAID UPON THE LAP OF THE GREAT MOUNTAINS BEHIND THE STARKHORN SOUTHWARDS AND NORTHWARDS THE SAWTOOTHED MASS OF IRENSAGA BETWEEN WHICH THERE FACED THE RIDERS THE GRIM BLACK WALL OF THE DWIMORBERG THE HAUNTED MOUNTAIN RISING OUT OF STEEP SLOPES OF SOMBRE PINES DIVIDING THE UPLAND INTO TWO THERE MARCHED A DOUBLE LINE OF UNSHAPED STANDING STONES THAT DWINDLED INTO THE DUSK AND VANISHED IN THE TREES THOSE WHO DARED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD CAME SOON TO THE BLACK DIMHOLT UNDER DWIMORBERG AND THE MENACE OF THE PILLAR OF STONE AND THE YAWNING SHADOW OF THE FORBIDDEN DOOR
     SUCH WAS THE DARK DUNHARROW THE WORK OF LONGFORGOTTEN MEN THEIR NAME WAS LOST AND NO SONG OR LEGEND REMEMBERED IT FOR WHAT PURPOSE THEY HAD MADE THIS PLACE AS A TOWN OR SECRET TEMPLE OR A TOMB OF KINGS NONE COULD SAY HERE THEY LABOURED IN THE DARK YEARS BEFORE EVER A SHIP CAME TO THE WESTERN SHORES OR GONDOR OF THE DUNEDAIN WAS BUILT AND NOW THEY HAD VANISHED AND ONLY THE OLD PUKELMEN WERE LEFT STILL SITTING AT THE TURNINGS OF THE ROAD
     MERRY STARED AT THE LINES OF MARCHING STONES THEY WERE WORN AND BLACK SOME WERE LEANING SOME WERE FALLEN SOME CRACKED OR BROKEN THEY LOOKED LIKE ROWS OF OLD AND HUNGRY TEETH HE WONDERED WHAT THEY COULD BE AND HE HOPED THAT THE KING WAS NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THEM INTO THE DARKNESS BEYOND THEN HE SAW THAT THERE WERE CLUSTERS OF TENTS AND BOOTHS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE STONY WAY BUT THESE WERE NOT SET NEAR THE TREES AND SEEMED RATHER TO HUDDLE AWAY FROM THEM TOWARDS THE BRINK OF THE CLIFF THE GREATER NUMBER WERE ON THE RIGHT WHERE THE FIRIENFELD WAS WIDER AND ON THE LEFT THERE WAS A SMALLER CAMP IN THE MIDST OF WHICH STOOD A TALL PAVILION FROM THIS SIDE A RIDER NOW CAME OUT TO MEET THEM AND THEY TURNED FROM THE ROAD
     AS THEY DREW NEAR MERRY SAW THAT THE RIDER WAS A WOMAN WITH LONG BRAIDED HAIR GLEAMING IN THE TWILIGHT YET SHE WORE A HELM AND WAS CLAD TO THE WAIST LIKE A WARRIOR AND GIRDED WITH A SWORD
     HAIL LORD OF THE MARK SHE CRIED MY HEART IS GLAD AT YOUR RETURNING
     AND YOU 
     ALL IS WELL SHE ANSWERED YET IT SEEMED TO MERRY THAT HER VOICE BELIED HER AND HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN WEEPING IF THAT COULD BE BELIEVED OF ONE SO STERN OF FACE ALL IS WELL IT WAS A WEARY ROAD FOR THE PEOPLE TO TAKE TORN SUDDENLY FROM THEIR HOMES THERE WERE HARD WORDS FOR IT IS LONG SINCE WAR HAS DRIVEN US FROM THE GREEN FIELDS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO EVIL DEEDS ALL IS NOW ORDERED AS YOU SEE AND YOUR LODGING IS PREPARED FOR YOU FOR I HAVE HAD FULL TIDINGS OF YOU AND KNEW THE HOUR OF YOUR COMING
     SO ARAGORN HAS COME THEN SAID 
     NO HE IS GONE SAID 
     WHITHER DID HE GO ASKED 
     I DO NOT KNOW SHE ANSWERED HE CAME AT NIGHT AND RODE AWAY YESTERMORN ERE THE SUN HAD CLIMBED OVER THE MOUNTAINTOPS HE IS GONE
     YOU ARE GRIEVED DAUGHTER SAID TH
     YES LORD SAID 
     THEN OUR PATHS ARE SUNDERED SAID 
     SLOWLY THEY PASSED THROUGH THE SHORT HEATH AND UPLAND GRASS SPEAKING NO MORE UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE KINGS PAVILION THERE MERRY FOUND THAT EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY AND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN A LITTLE TENT HAD BEEN PITCHED FOR HIM BESIDE THE KINGS LODGING AND THERE HE SAT ALONE WHILE MEN PASSED TO AND FRO GOING IN TO THE KING AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH HIM NIGHT CAME ON AND THE HALFSEEN HEADS OF THE MOUNTAINS WESTWARD WERE CROWNED WITH STARS BUT THE EAST WAS DARK AND BLANK THE MARCHING STONES FADED SLOWLY FROM SIGHT BUT STILL BEYOND THEM BLACKER THAN THE GLOOM BROODED THE VAST CROUCHING SHADOW OF THE DWIMORBERG
     THE PATHS OF THE DEAD HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF THE PATHS OF THE DEAD WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN THEY HAVE ALL LEFT ME NOW THEY HAVE ALL GONE TO SOME DOOM GANDALF AND PIPPIN TO WAR IN THE EAST AND SAM AND FRODO TO MORDOR AND STRIDER AND LEGOLAS AND GIMLI TO THE PATHS OF THE DEAD BUT MY TURN WILL COME SOON ENOUGH I SUPPOSE I WONDER WHAT THEY ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT THE KING MEANS TO DO FOR I MUST GO WHERE HE GOES NOW
     IN THE MIDST OF THESE GLOOMY THOUGHTS HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS VERY HUNGRY AND HE GOT UP TO GO AND SEE IF ANYONE ELSE IN THIS STRANGE CAMP FELT THE SAME BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT A TRUMPET SOUNDED AND A MAN CAME SUMMONING HIM THE KINGS ESQUIRE TO WAIT AT THE KINGS BOARD
     IN THE INNER PART OF THE PAVILION WAS A SMALL SPACE CURTAINED OFF WITH BROIDERED HANGINGS AND STREWN WITH SKINS AND THERE AT A SMALL TABLE SAT TH
     COME MASTER MERIADOC HE SAID YOU SHALL NOT STAND YOU SHALL SIT BESIDE ME AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN MY OWN LANDS AND LIGHTEN MY HEART WITH TALES
     ROOM WAS MADE FOR THE HOBBIT AT THE KINGS LEFT HAND BUT NO ONE CALLED FOR ANY TALE THERE WAS INDEED LITTLE SPEECH AND THEY ATE AND DRANK FOR THE MOST PART IN SILENCE UNTIL AT LAST PLUCKING UP COURAGE MERRY ASKED THE QUESTION THAT WAS TORMENTING HIM
     TWICE NOW LORD I HAVE HEARD OF THE PATHS OF THE DEAD HE SAID WHAT ARE THEY AND WHERE HAS STRIDER I MEAN THE LORD ARAGORN WHERE HAS HE GONE
     THE KING SIGHED BUT NO ONE ANSWERED UNTIL AT LAST 
     NO MAN KNOWS SAID TH TO SEARCH ITS SECRETS SINCE BALDOR SON OF BREGO PASSED THE DOOR AND WAS NEVER SEEN AMONG MEN AGAIN A RASH VOW HE SPOKE AS HE DRAINED THE HORN AT THAT FEAST WHICH BREGO MADE TO HALLOW NEWBUILT MEDUSELD AND HE CAME NEVER TO THE HIGH SEAT OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEIR
     FOLK SAY THAT DEAD MEN OUT OF THE DARK YEARS GUARD THE WAY AND WILL SUFFER NO LIVING MAN TO COME TO THEIR HIDDEN HALLS BUT AT WHILES THEY MAY THEMSELVES BE SEEN PASSING OUT OF THE DOOR LIKE SHADOWS AND DOWN THE STONY ROAD THEN THE PEOPLE OF HARROWDALE SHUT FAST THEIR DOORS AND SHROUD THEIR WINDOWS AND ARE AFRAID BUT THE DEAD COME SELDOM FORTH AND ONLY AT TIMES OF GREAT UNQUIET AND COMING DEATH
     YET IT IS SAID IN HARROWDALE SAID 
     THEN WHY HAS ARAGORN GONE THAT WAY ASKED MERRY DONT YOU KNOW ANYTHING THAT WOULD EXPLAIN IT
     UNLESS HE HAS SPOKEN WORDS TO YOU AS HIS FRIEND THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD SAID 
     GREATLY CHANGED HE SEEMED TO ME SINCE I SAW HIM FIRST IN THE KINGS HOUSE SAID 
     MAYBE HE WAS CALLED SAID THING STRONG PLACES OF REFUGE IN TIME OF NEED BREGO AND HIS SON BALDOR CLIMBED THE STAIR OF THE HOLD AND SO CAME BEFORE THE DOOR ON THE THRESHOLD SAT AN OLD MAN AGED BEYOND GUESS OF YEARS TALL AND KINGLY HE HAD BEEN BUT NOW HE WAS WITHERED AS AN OLD STONE INDEED FOR STONE THEY TOOK HIM FOR HE MOVED NOT AND HE SAID NO WORD UNTIL THEY SOUGHT TO PASS HIM BY AND ENTER AND THEN A VOICE CAME OUT OF HIM AS IT WERE OUT OF THE GROUND AND TO THEIR AMAZE IT SPOKE IN THE WESTERN TONGUE THE WAY IS SHUT
     THEN THEY HALTED AND LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW THAT HE LIVED STILL BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT THEM THE WAY IS SHUT HIS VOICE SAID AGAIN IT WAS MADE BY THOSE WHO ARE DEAD AND THE DEAD KEEP IT UNTIL THE TIME COMES THE WAY IS SHUT
     AND WHEN WILL THAT TIME BE SAID BALDOR BUT NO ANSWER DID HE EVER GET FOR THE OLD MAN DIED IN THAT HOUR AND FELL UPON HIS FACE AND NO OTHER TIDINGS OF THE ANCIENT DWELLERS IN THE MOUNTAINS HAVE OUR FOLK EVER LEARNED YET MAYBE AT LAST THE TIME FORETOLD HAS COME AND ARAGORN MAY PASS
     BUT HOW SHALL A MAN DISCOVER WHETHER THAT TIME BE COME OR NO SAVE BY DARING THE DOOR SAID AD WITHOUT SEEKING THEM UNDER THE EARTH WAR IS AT HAND
     HE PAUSED FOR AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A NOISE OUTSIDE A MANS VOICE CRYING THE NAME OF TH
     PRESENTLY THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD THRUST ASIDE THE CURTAIN A MAN IS HERE LORD HE SAID AN ERRANDRIDER OF GONDOR HE WISHES TO COME BEFORE YOU AT ONCE
     LET HIM COME SAID TH
     A TALL MAN ENTERED AND MERRY CHOKED BACK A CRY FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT BOROMIR WAS ALIVE AGAIN AND HAD RETURNED THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS NOT SO THE MAN WAS A STRANGER THOUGH AS LIKE TO BOROMIR AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS KIN TALL AND GREYEYED AND PROUD HE WAS CLAD AS A RIDER WITH A CLOAK OF DARK GREEN OVER A COAT OF FINE MAIL ON THE FRONT OF HIS HELM WAS WROUGHT A SMALL SILVER STAR IN HIS HAND HE BORE A SINGLE ARROW BLACKFEATHERED AND BARBED WITH STEEL BUT THE POINT WAS PAINTED RED
     HE SANK ON ONE KNEE AND PRESENTED THE ARROW TO TH
     THE RED ARROW SAID TH
     THAT IS BEST KNOWN TO YOURSELF LORD SAID HIRGON BUT ERE LONG IT MAY WELL COME TO PASS THAT MINAS TIRITH IS SURROUNDED AND UNLESS YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO BREAK A SIEGE OF MANY POWERS THE LORD DENETHOR BIDS ME SAY THAT HE JUDGES THAT THE STRONG ARMS OF THE ROHIRRIM WOULD BE BETTER WITHIN HIS WALLS THAN WITHOUT
     BUT HE KNOWS THAT WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO FIGHT RATHER UPON HORSEBACK AND IN THE OPEN AND THAT WE ARE ALSO A SCATTERED PEOPLE AND TIME IS NEEDED FOR THE GATHERING OF OUR RIDERS IS IT NOT TRUE HIRGON THAT THE LORD OF MINAS TIRITH KNOWS MORE THAN HE SETS IN HIS MESSAGE FOR WE ARE ALREADY AT WAR AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN AND YOU DO NOT FIND US ALL UNPREPARED GANDALF THE GREY HAS BEEN AMONG US AND EVEN NOW WE ARE MUSTERING FOR BATTLE IN THE EAST
     WHAT THE LORD DENETHOR MAY KNOW OR GUESS OF ALL THESE THINGS I CANNOT SAY ANSWERED HIRGON BUT INDEED OUR CASE IS DESPERATE MY LORD DOES NOT ISSUE ANY COMMAND TO YOU HE BEGS YOU ONLY TO REMEMBER OLD FRIENDSHIP AND OATHS LONG SPOKEN AND FOR YOUR OWN GOOD TO DO ALL THAT YOU MAY IT IS REPORTED TO US THAT MANY KINGS HAVE RIDDEN IN FROM THE EAST TO THE SERVICE OF MORDOR FROM THE NORTH TO THE FIELD OF DAGORLAD THERE IS SKIRMISH AND RUMOUR OF WAR IN THE SOUTH THE HARADRIM ARE MOVING AND FEAR HAS FALLEN ON ALL OUR COASTLANDS SO THAT LITTLE HELP WILL COME TO US THENCE MAKE HASTE FOR IT IS BEFORE THE WALLS OF MINAS TIRITH THAT THE DOOM OF OUR TIME WILL BE DECIDED AND IF THE TIDE BE NOT STEMMED THERE THEN IT WILL FLOW OVER ALL THE FAIR FIELDS OF ROHAN AND EVEN IN THIS HOLD AMONG THE HILLS THERE SHALL BE NO REFUGE
     DARK TIDINGS SAID THA POWER AS THE DARK LORD SEEMS NOW TO WIELD MIGHT WELL CONTAIN US IN BATTLE BEFORE THE CITY AND YET STRIKE WITH GREAT FORCE ACROSS THE RIVER AWAY BEYOND THE GATE OF KINGS
     BUT WE WILL SPEAK NO LONGER COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE WE WILL COME THE WEAPONTAKE WAS SET FOR THE MORROW WHEN ALL IS ORDERED WE WILL SET OUT TEN THOUSAND SPEARS I MIGHT HAVE SENT RIDING OVER THE PLAIN TO THE DISMAY OF YOUR FOES IT WILL BE LESS NOW I FEAR FOR I WILL NOT LEAVE MY STRONGHOLDS ALL UNGUARDED YET SIX THOUSANDS AT THE LEAST SHALL RIDE BEHIND ME FOR SAY TO DENETHOR THAT IN THIS HOUR THE KING OF THE MARK HIMSELF WILL COME DOWN TO THE LAND OF GONDOR THOUGH MAYBE HE WILL NOT RIDE BACK BUT IT IS A LONG ROAD AND MAN AND BEAST MUST REACH THE END WITH STRENGTH TO FIGHT A WEEK IT MAY BE FROM TOMORROWS MORN ERE YOU HEAR THE CRY OF THE SONS OF EORL COMING FROM THE NORTH

     AT THE LEAST WE WILL DO THAT SAID TH
     WITH THAT THE KING STOOD UP AND THEY ALL ROSE GO NOW EACH TO YOUR REST HE SAID AND SLEEP WELL AND YOU MASTER MERIADOC I NEED NO MORE TONIGHT BUT BE READY TO MY CALL AS SOON AS THE SUN IS RISEN
     I WILL BE READY SAID MERRY EVEN IF YOU BID ME RIDE WITH YOU ON THE PATHS OF THE DEAD

     I WONT BE LEFT BEHIND TO BE CALLED FOR ON RETURN SAID MERRY I WONT BE LEFT I WONT AND REPEATING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HIMSELF HE FELL ASLEEP AT LAST IN HIS TENT
     HE WAS WAKENED BY A MAN SHAKING HIM WAKE UP WAKE UP MASTER HOLBYTLA HE CRIED AND AT LENGTH MERRY CAME OUT OF DEEP DREAMS AND SAT UP WITH A START IT STILL SEEMED VERY DARK HE THOUGHT

     MERRY BOWED AND THE LADY SHOWED HIM THE SHIELD WHICH WAS LIKE THE SHIELD THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO GIMLI AND IT BORE ON IT THE DEVICE OF THE WHITE HORSE TAKE ALL THESE THINGS SHE SAID AND BEAR THEM TO GOOD FORTUNE FAREWELL NOW MASTER MERIADOC YET MAYBE WE SHALL MEET AGAIN YOU AND I
     SO IT WAS THAT AMID A GATHERING GLOOM THE KING OF THE MARK MADE READY TO LEAD ALL HIS RIDERS ON THE EASTWARD ROAD HEARTS WERE HEAVY AND MANY QUAILED IN THE SHADOW BUT THEY WERE A STERN PEOPLE LOYAL TO THEIR LORD AND LITTLE WEEPING OR MURMURING WAS HEARD EVEN IN THE CAMP IN THE HOLD WHERE THE EXILES FROM EDORAS WERE HOUSED WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND OLD MEN DOOM HUNG OVER THEM BUT THEY FACED IT SILENTLY
     TWO SWIFT HOURS PASSED AND NOW THE KING SAT UPON HIS WHITE HORSE GLIMMERING IN THE HALF LIGHT PROUD AND TALL HE SEEMED THOUGH THE HAIR THAT FLOWED BENEATH HIS HIGH HELM WAS LIKE SNOW AND MANY MARVELLED AT HIM AND TOOK HEART TO SEE HIM UNBENT AND UNAFRAID
     THERE ON THE WIDE FLATS BESIDE THE NOISY RIVER WERE MARSHALLED IN MANY COMPANIES WELL NIGH FIVE AND FIFTY HUNDREDS OF RIDERS FULLY ARMED AND MANY HUNDREDS OF OTHER MEN WITH SPARE HORSES LIGHTLY BURDENED A SINGLE TRUMPET SOUNDED THE KING RAISED HIS HAND AND THEN SILENTLY THE HOST OF THE MARK BEGAN TO MOVE FOREMOST WENT TWELVE OF THE KINGS HOUSEHOLDMEN RIDERS OF RENOWN THEN THE KING FOLLOWED WITH  LONG RANKS OF WAITING MEN WITH STERN AND UNMOVED FACES BUT WHEN THEY HAD COME ALMOST TO THE END OF THE LINE ONE LOOKED UP GLANCING KEENLY AT THE HOBBIT A YOUNG MAN MERRY THOUGHT AS HE RETURNED THE GLANCE LESS IN HEIGHT AND GIRTH THAN MOST HE CAUGHT THE GLINT OF CLEAR GREY EYES AND THEN HE SHIVERED FOR IT CAME SUDDENLY TO HIM THAT IT WAS THE FACE OF ONE WITHOUT HOPE WHO GOES IN SEARCH OF DEATH
     ON DOWN THE GREY ROAD THEY WENT BESIDE THE SNOWBOURN RUSHING ON ITS STONES THROUGH THE HAMLETS OF UNDERHARROW AND UPBOURN WHERE MANY SAD FACES OF WOMEN LOOKED OUT FROM DARK DOORS AND SO WITHOUT HORN OR HARP OR MUSIC OF MENS VOICES THE GREAT RIDE INTO THE EAST BEGAN WITH WHICH THE SONGS OF ROHAN WERE BUSY FOR MANY LONG LIVES OF MEN THEREAFTER

      CHAPTER 4
      THE SIEGE OF GONDOR
     

     PIPPIN WAS ROUSED BY GANDALF CANDLES WERE LIT IN THEIR CHAMBER FOR ONLY A DIM TWILIGHT CAME THROUGH THE WINDOWS THE AIR WAS HEAVY AS WITH APPROACHING THUNDER
     WHAT IS THE TIME SAID PIPPIN YAWNING
     PAST THE SECOND HOUR SAID GANDALF TIME TO GET UP AND MAKE YOURSELF PRESENTABLE YOU ARE SUMMONED TO THE LORD OF THE CITY TO LEARN YOUR NEW DUTIES
     AND WILL HE PROVIDE BREAKFAST
     NO I HAVE PROVIDED IT ALL THAT YOU WILL GET TILL NOON FOOD IS NOW DOLED OUT BY ORDER
     PIPPIN LOOKED RUEFULLY AT THE SMALL LOAF AND HE THOUGHT VERY INADEQUATE PAT OF BUTTER WHICH WAS SET OUT FOR HIM BESIDE A CUP OF THIN MILK WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE HE SAID
     YOU KNOW QUITE WELL SAID GANDALF TO KEEP YOU OUT OF MISCHIEF AND IF YOU DO NOT LIKE BEING HERE YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT YOU BROUGHT IT ON YOURSELF PIPPIN SAID NO MORE
     BEFORE LONG HE WAS WALKING WITH GANDALF ONCE MORE DOWN THE COLD CORRIDOR TO THE DOOR OF THE TOWER HALL THERE DENETHOR SAT IN A GREY GLOOM LIKE AN OLD PATIENT SPIDER PIPPIN THOUGHT HE DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE MOVED SINCE THE DAY BEFORE HE BECKONED GANDALF TO A SEAT BUT PIPPIN WAS LEFT FOR A WHILE STANDING UNHEEDED PRESENTLY THE OLD MAN TURNED TO HIM
     WELL MASTER PEREGRIN I HOPE THAT YOU USED YESTERDAY TO YOUR PROFIT AND TO YOUR LIKING THOUGH I FEAR THAT THE BOARD IS BARER IN THIS CITY THAN YOU COULD WISH
     PIPPIN HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT MOST OF WHAT HE HAD SAID OR DONE WAS SOMEHOW KNOWN TO THE LORD OF THE CITY AND MUCH WAS GUESSED OF WHAT HE THOUGHT AS WELL HE DID NOT ANSWER
     WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN MY SERVICE
     I THOUGHT SIR THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME MY DUTIES
     I WILL WHEN I LEARN WHAT YOU ARE FIT FOR SAID DENETHOR BUT THAT I SHALL LEARN SOONEST MAYBE IF I KEEP YOU BESIDE ME THE ESQUIRE OF MY CHAMBER HAS BEGGED LEAVE TO GO TO THE OUTGARRISON SO YOU SHALL TAKE HIS PLACE FOR A WHILE YOU SHALL WAIT ON ME BEAR ERRANDS AND TALK TO ME IF WAR AND COUNCIL LEAVE ME ANY LEISURE CAN YOU SING
     YES SAID PIPPIN WELL YES WELL ENOUGH FOR MY OWN PEOPLE BUT WE HAVE NO SONGS FIT FOR GREAT HALLS AND EVIL TIMES LORD WE SELDOM SING OF ANYTHING MORE TERRIBLE THAN WIND OR RAIN AND MOST OF MY SONGS ARE ABOUT THINGS THAT MAKE US LAUGH OR ABOUT FOOD AND DRINK OF COURSE
     AND WHY SHOULD SUCH SONGS BE UNFIT FOR MY HALLS OR FOR SUCH HOURS AS THESE WE WHO HAVE LIVED LONG UNDER THE SHADOW MAY SURELY LISTEN TO ECHOES FROM A LAND UNTROUBLED BY IT THEN WE MAY FEEL THAT OUR VIGIL WAS NOT FRUITLESS THOUGH IT MAY HAVE BEEN THANKLESS
     PIPPINS HEART SANK HE DID NOT RELISH THE IDEA OF SINGING ANY SONG OF THE SHIRE TO THE LORD OF MINAS TIRITH CERTAINLY NOT THE COMIC ONES THAT HE KNEW BEST THEY WERE TOO WELL RUSTIC FOR SUCH AN OCCASION HE WAS HOWEVER SPARED THE ORDEAL FOR THE PRESENT HE WAS NOT COMMANDED TO SING DENETHOR TURNED TO GANDALF ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROHIRRIM AND THEIR POLICIES AND THE POSITION OF 
     PRESENTLY DENETHOR WAVED TO PIPPIN AND DISMISSED HIM AGAIN FOR A WHILE GO TO THE ARMOURIES OF THE CITADEL HE SAID AND GET YOU THERE THE LIVERY AND GEAR OF THE TOWER IT WILL BE READY IT WAS COMMANDED YESTERDAY RETURN WHEN YOU ARE CLAD
     IT WAS AS HE SAID AND PIPPIN SOON FOUND HIMSELF ARRAYED IN STRANGE GARMENTS ALL OF BLACK AND SILVER HE HAD A SMALL HAUBERK ITS RINGS FORGED OF STEEL MAYBE YET BLACK AS JET AND A HIGHCROWNED HELM WITH SMALL RAVENWINGS ON EITHER SIDE SET WITH A SILVER STAR IN THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCLET ABOVE THE MAIL WAS A SHORT SURCOAT OF BLACK BUT BROIDERED ON THE BREAST IN SILVER WITH THE TOKEN OF THE TREE HIS OLD CLOTHES WERE FOLDED AND PUT AWAY BUT HE WAS PERMITTED TO KEEP THE GREY CLOAK OF LERNIL I PHERIANNATH THE PRINCE OF THE HALFLINGS THAT FOLK HAD CALLED HIM BUT HE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE GLOOM BEGAN TO WEIGH ON HIS SPIRITS
     IT WAS DARK AND DIM ALL DAY FROM THE SUNLESS DAWN UNTIL EVENING THE HEAVY SHADOW HAD DEEPENED AND ALL HEARTS IN THE CITY WERE OPPRESSED FAR ABOVE A GREAT CLOUD STREAMED SLOWLY WESTWARD FROM THE BLACK LAND DEVOURING LIGHT BORNE UPON A WIND OF WAR BUT BELOW THE AIR WAS STILL AND BREATHLESS AS IF ALL THE VALE OF ANDUIN WAITED FOR THE ONSET OF A RUINOUS STORM
     ABOUT THE ELEVENTH HOUR RELEASED AT LAST FOR A WHILE FROM SERVICE PIPPIN CAME OUT AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FOOD AND DRINK TO CHEER HIS HEAVY HEART AND MAKE HIS TASK OF WAITING MORE SUPPORTABLE IN THE MESSES HE MET BEREGOND AGAIN WHO HAD JUST COME FROM AN ERRAND OVER THE PELENNOR OUT TO THE GUARDTOWERS UPON THE CAUSEWAY TOGETHER THEY STROLLED OUT TO THE WALLS FOR PIPPIN FELT IMPRISONED INDOORS AND STIFLED EVEN IN THE LOFTY CITADEL NOW THEY SAT SIDE BY SIDE AGAIN IN THE EMBRASURE LOOKING EASTWARD WHERE THEY HAD EATEN AND TALKED THE DAY BEFORE
     IT WAS THE SUNSETHOUR BUT THE GREAT PALL HAD NOW STRETCHED FAR INTO THE WEST AND ONLY AS IT SANK AT LAST INTO THE SEA DID THE SUN ESCAPE TO SEND OUT A BRIEF FAREWELL GLEAM BEFORE THE NIGHT EVEN AS FRODO SAW IT AT THE CROSSROADS TOUCHING THE HEAD OF THE FALLEN KING BUT TO THE FIELDS OF THE PELENNOR UNDER THE SHADOW OF MINDOLLUIN THERE CAME NO GLEAM THEY WERE BROWN AND DREAR
     ALREADY IT SEEMED YEARS TO PIPPIN SINCE HE HAD SAT THERE BEFORE IN SOME HALFFORGOTTEN TIME WHEN HE HAD STILL BEEN A HOBBIT A LIGHTHEARTED WANDERER TOUCHED LITTLE BY THE PERILS HE HAD PASSED THROUGH NOW HE WAS ONE SMALL SOLDIER IN A CITY PREPARING FOR A GREAT ASSAULT CLAD IN THE PROUD BUT SOMBRE MANNER OF THE TOWER OF GUARD
     IN SOME OTHER TIME AND PLACE PIPPIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH HIS NEW ARRAY BUT HE KNEW NOW THAT HE WAS TAKING PART IN NO PLAY HE WAS IN DEADLY EARNEST THE SERVANT OF A GRIM MASTER IN THE GREATEST PERIL THE HAUBERK WAS BURDENSOME AND THE HELM WEIGHED UPON HIS HEAD HIS CLOAK HE HAD CAST ASIDE UPON THE SEAT HE TURNED HIS TIRED GAZE AWAY FROM THE DARKLING FIELDS BELOW AND YAWNED AND THEN HE SIGHED
     YOU ARE WEARY OF THIS DAY SAID BEREGOND
     YES SAID PIPPIN VERY TIRED OUT WITH IDLENESS AND WAITING I HAVE KICKED MY HEELS AT THE DOOR OF MY MASTERS CHAMBER FOR MANY SLOW HOURS WHILE HE HAS DEBATED WITH GANDALF AND THE PRINCE AND OTHER GREAT PERSONS AND IM NOT USED MASTER BEREGOND TO WAITING HUNGRY ON OTHERS WHILE THEY EAT IT IS A SORE TRIAL FOR A HOBBIT THAT NO DOUBT YOU WILL THINK I SHOULD FEEL THE HONOUR MORE DEEPLY BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF SUCH HONOUR INDEED WHAT IS THE GOOD EVEN OF FOOD AND DRINK UNDER THIS CREEPING SHADOW WHAT DOES IT MEAN THE VERY AIR SEEMS THICK AND BROWN DO YOU OFTEN HAVE SUCH GLOOMS WHEN THE WIND IS IN THE EAST
     NAY SAID BEREGOND THIS IS NO WEATHER OF THE WORLD THIS IS SOME DEVICE OF HIS MALICE SOME BROIL OF FUME FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF FIRE THAT HE SENDS TO DARKEN HEARTS AND COUNSEL AND SO IT DOTH INDEED I WISH THE LORD FARAMIR WOULD RETURN HE WOULD NOT BE DISMAYED BUT NOW WHO KNOWS IF HE WILL EVER COME BACK ACROSS THE RIVER OUT OF THE DARKNESS
     YES SAID PIPPIN GANDALF TOO IS ANXIOUS HE WAS DISAPPOINTED I THINK NOT TO FIND FARAMIR HERE AND WHERE HAS HE GOT TO HIMSELF HE LEFT THE LORDS COUNCIL BEFORE THE NOONMEAL AND IN NO GOOD MOOD EITHER I THOUGHT PERHAPS HE HAS SOME FOREBODING OF BAD NEWS
     SUDDENLY AS THEY TALKED THEY WERE STRICKEN DUMB FROZEN AS IT WERE TO LISTENING STONES PIPPIN COWERED DOWN WITH HIS HANDS PRESSED TO HIS EARS BUT BEREGOND WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING OUT FROM THE BATTLEMENT AS HE SPOKE OF FARAMIR REMAINED THERE STIFFENED STARING OUT WITH STARTING EYES PIPPIN KNEW THE SHUDDERING CRY THAT HE HAD HEARD IT WAS THE SAME THAT HE HAD HEARD LONG AGO IN THE MARISH OF THE SHIRE BUT NOW IT WAS GROWN IN POWER AND HATRED PIERCING THE HEART WITH A POISONOUS DESPAIR
     AT LAST BEREGOND SPOKE WITH AN EFFORT THEY HAVE COME HE SAID TAKE COURAGE AND LOOK THERE ARE FELL THINGS BELOW
     RELUCTANTLY PIPPIN CLIMBED ON TO THE SEAT AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE WALL THE PELENNOR LAY DIM BENEATH HIM FADING AWAY TO THE SCARCE GUESSED LINE OF THE GREAT RIVER BUT NOW WHEELING SWIFTLY ACROSS IT LIKE SHADOWS OF UNTIMELY NIGHT HE SAW IN THE MIDDLE AIRS BELOW HIM FIVE BIRDLIKE FORMS HORRIBLE AS CARRIONFOWL YET GREATER THAN EAGLES CRUEL AS DEATH NOW THEY SWOOPED NEAR VENTURING ALMOST WITHIN BOWSHOT OF THE WALLS NOW THEY CIRCLED AWAY
     BLACK RIDERS MUTTERED PIPPIN BLACK RIDERS OF THE AIR BUT SEE BEREGOND HE CRIED THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SURELY SEE HOW THEY WHEEL AND SWOOP ALWAYS DOWN TO THAT POINT OVER THERE AND CAN YOU SEE SOMETHING MOVING ON THE GROUND DARK LITTLE THINGS YES MEN ON HORSES FOUR OR FIVE AH I CANNOT STAND IT GANDALF GANDALF SAVE US
     ANOTHER LONG SCREECH ROSE AND FELL AND HE THREW HIMSELF BACK AGAIN FROM THE WALL PANTING LIKE A HUNTED ANIMAL FAINT AND SEEMINGLY REMOTE THROUGH THAT SHUDDERING CRY HE HEARD WINDING UP FROM BELOW THE SOUND OF A TRUMPET ENDING ON A LONG HIGH NOTE
     FARAMIR THE LORD FARAMIR IT IS HIS CALL CRIED BEREGOND BRAVE HEART BUT HOW CAN HE WIN TO THE GATE IF THESE FOUL HELLHAWKS HAVE OTHER WEAPONS THAN FEAR BUT LOOK THEY HOLD ON THEY WILL MAKE THE GATE NO THE HORSES ARE RUNNING MAD LOOK THE MEN ARE THROWN THEY ARE RUNNING ON FOOT NO ONE IS STILL UP BUT HE RIDES BACK TO THE OTHERS THAT WILL BE THE CAPTAIN HE CAN MASTER BOTH BEASTS AND MEN AH THERE ONE OF THE FOUL THINGS IS STOOPING ON HIM HELP HELP WILL NO ONE GO OUT TO HIM FARAMIR
     WITH THAT BEREGOND SPRANG AWAY AND RAN OFF INTO THE GLOOM ASHAMED OF HIS TERROR WHILE BEREGOND OF THE GUARD THOUGHT FIRST OF THE CAPTAIN WHOM HE LOVED PIPPIN GOT UP AND PEERED OUT AT THAT MOMENT HE CAUGHT A FLASH OF WHITE AND SILVER COMING FROM THE NORTH LIKE A SMALL STAR DOWN ON THE DUSKY FIELDS IT MOVED WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW AND GREW AS IT CAME CONVERGING SWIFTLY WITH THE FLIGHT OF THE FOUR MEN TOWARDS THE GATE IT SEEMED TO PIPPIN THAT A PALE LIGHT WAS SPREAD ABOUT IT AND THE HEAVY SHADOWS GAVE WAY BEFORE IT AND THEN AS IT DREW NEAR HE THOUGHT THAT HE HEARD LIKE AN ECHO IN THE WALLS A GREAT VOICE CALLING
     GANDALF HE CRIED GANDALF HE ALWAYS TURNS UP WHEN THINGS ARE DARKEST GO ON GO ON WHITE RIDER GANDALF GANDALF HE SHOUTED WILDLY LIKE AN ONLOOKER AT A GREAT RACE URGING ON A RUNNER WHO IS FAR BEYOND ENCOURAGEMENT
     BUT NOW THE DARK SWOOPING SHADOWS WERE AWARE OF THE NEWCOMER ONE WHEELED TOWARDS HIM BUT IT SEEMED TO PIPPIN THAT HE RAISED HIS HAND AND FROM IT A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT STABBED UPWARDS THE NAZG
     PIPPIN WATCHED AND HE SAW THE HORSEMAN AND THE WHITE RIDER MEET AND HALT WAITING FOR THOSE ON FOOT MEN NOW HURRIED OUT TO THEM FROM THE CITY AND SOON THEY ALL PASSED FROM SIGHT UNDER THE OUTER WALLS AND HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE ENTERING THE GATE GUESSING THAT THEY WOULD COME AT ONCE TO THE TOWER AND THE STEWARD HE HURRIED TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CITADEL THERE HE WAS JOINED BY MANY OTHERS WHO HAD WATCHED THE RACE AND THE RESCUE FROM THE HIGH WALLS
     IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE A CLAMOUR WAS HEARD IN THE STREETS LEADING UP FROM THE OUTER CIRCLES AND THERE WAS MUCH CHEERING AND CRYING OF THE NAMES OF FARAMIR AND MITHRANDIR PRESENTLY PIPPIN SAW TORCHES AND FOLLOWED BY A PRESS OF PEOPLE TWO HORSEMEN RIDING SLOWLY ONE WAS IN WHITE BUT SHINING NO LONGER PALE IN THE TWILIGHT AS IF HIS FIRE WAS SPENT OR VEILED THE OTHER WAS DARK AND HIS HEAD WAS BOWED THEY DISMOUNTED AND AS GROOMS TOOK SHADOWFAX AND THE OTHER HORSE THEY WALKED FORWARD TO THE SENTINEL AT THE GATE GANDALF STEADILY HIS GREY CLOAK FLUNG BACK AND A FIRE STILL SMOULDERING IN HIS EYES THE OTHER CLAD ALL IN GREEN SLOWLY SWAYING A LITTLE AS A WEARY OR A WOUNDED MAN
     PIPPIN PRESSED FORWARD AS THEY PASSED UNDER THE LAMP BENEATH THE GATEARCH AND WHEN HE SAW THE PALE FACE OF FARAMIR HE CAUGHT HIS BREATH IT WAS THE FACE OF ONE WHO HAS BEEN ASSAILED BY A GREAT FEAR OR ANGUISH BUT HAS MASTERED IT AND NOW IS QUIET PROUD AND GRAVE HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT AS HE SPOKE TO THE GUARD AND PIPPIN GAZING AT HIM SAW HOW CLOSELY HE RESEMBLED HIS BROTHER BOROMIR  WHOM PIPPIN HAD LIKED FROM THE FIRST ADMIRING THE GREAT MANS LORDLY BUT KINDLY MANNER YET SUDDENLY FOR FARAMIR HIS HEART WAS STRANGELY MOVED WITH A FEELING THAT HE HAD NOT KNOWN BEFORE HERE WAS ONE WITH AN AIR OF HIGH NOBILITY SUCH AS ARAGORN AT TIMES REVEALED LESS HIGH PERHAPS YET ALSO LESS INCALCULABLE AND REMOTE ONE OF THE KINGS OF MEN BORN INTO A LATER TIME BUT TOUCHED WITH THE WISDOM AND SADNESS OF THE ELDER RACE HE KNEW NOW WHY BEREGOND SPOKE HIS NAME WITH LOVE HE WAS A CAPTAIN THAT MEN WOULD FOLLOW THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW EVEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE BLACK WINGS
     FARAMIR HE CRIED ALOUD WITH THE OTHERS FARAMIR AND FARAMIR CATCHING HIS STRANGE VOICE AMONG THE CLAMOUR OF THE MEN OF THE CITY TURNED AND LOOKED DOWN AT HIM AND WAS AMAZED
     WHENCE COME YOU HE SAID A HALFLING AND IN THE LIVERY OF THE TOWER WHENCE
     BUT WITH THAT GANDALF STEPPED TO HIS SIDE AND SPOKE HE CAME WITH ME FROM THE LAND OF THE HALFLINGS HE SAID HE CAME WITH ME BUT LET US NOT TARRY HERE THERE IS MUCH TO SAY AND TO DO AND YOU ARE WEARY HE SHALL COME WITH US INDEED HE MUST FOR IF HE DOES NOT FORGET HIS NEW DUTIES MORE EASILY THAN I DO HE MUST ATTEND ON HIS LORD AGAIN WITHIN THIS HOUR COME PIPPIN FOLLOW US
     SO AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO THE PRIVATE CHAMBER OF THE LORD OF THE CITY THERE DEEP SEATS WERE SET ABOUT A BRAZIER OF CHARCOAL AND WINE WAS BROUGHT AND THERE PIPPIN HARDLY NOTICED STOOD BEHIND THE CHAIR OF DENETHOR AND FELT HIS WEARINESS LITTLE SO EAGERLY DID HE LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS SAID
     WHEN FARAMIR HAD TAKEN WHITE BREAD AND DRUNK A DRAUGHT OF WINE HE SAT UPON A LOW CHAIR AT HIS FATHERS LEFT HAND REMOVED A LITTLE UPON THE OTHER SIDE SAT GANDALF IN A CHAIR OF CARVEN WOOD AND HE SEEMED AT FIRST TO BE ASLEEP FOR AT THE BEGINNING FARAMIR SPOKE ONLY OF THE ERRAND UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT OUT TEN DAYS BEFORE AND HE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF ITHILIEN AND OF MOVEMENTS OF THE ENEMY AND HIS ALLIES AND HE TOLD OF THE FIGHT ON THE ROAD WHEN THE MEN OF HARAD AND THEIR GREAT BEAST WERE OVERTHROWN A CAPTAIN REPORTING TO HIS MASTER SUCH MATTERS AS HAD OFTEN BEEN HEARD BEFORE SMALL THINGS OF BORDERWAR THAT NOW SEEMED USELESS AND PETTY SHORN OF THEIR RENOWN
     THEN SUDDENLY FARAMIR LOOKED AT PIPPIN BUT NOW WE COME TO STRANGE MATTERS HE SAID FOR THIS IS NOT THE FIRST HALFLING THAT I HAVE SEEN WALKING OUT OF NORTHERN LEGENDS INTO THE SOUTHLANDS
     AT THAT GANDALF SAT UP AND GRIPPED THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND WITH A LOOK STOPPED THE EXCLAMATION ON PIPPINS LIPS DENETHOR LOOKED AT THEIR FACES AND NODDED HIS HEAD AS THOUGH IN SIGN THAT HE HAD READ MUCH THERE BEFORE IT WAS SPOKEN SLOWLY WHILE THE OTHERS SAT SILENT AND STILL FARAMIR TOLD HIS TALE WITH HIS EYES FOR THE MOST PART ON GANDALF THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN HIS GLANCE STRAYED TO PIPPIN AS IF TO REFRESH HIS MEMORY OF OTHERS THAT HE HAD SEEN
     AS HIS STORY WAS UNFOLDED OF HIS MEETING WITH FRODO AND HIS SERVANT AND OF THE EVENTS AT HENNETH ANNUN PIPPIN BECAME AWARE THAT GANDALFS HANDS WERE TREMBLING AS THEY CLUTCHED THE CARVEN WOOD WHITE THEY SEEMED NOW AND VERY OLD AND AS HE LOOKED AT THEM SUDDENLY WITH A THRILL OF FEAR PIPPIN KNEW THAT GANDALF GANDALF HIMSELF WAS TROUBLED EVEN AFRAID THE AIR OF THE ROOM WAS CLOSE AND STILL AT LAST WHEN FARAMIR SPOKE OF HIS PARTING WITH THE TRAVELLERS AND OF THEIR RESOLVE TO GO TO CIRITH UNGOL HIS VOICE FELL AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SIGHED THEN GANDALF SPRANG UP
     CIRITH UNGOL MORGUL VALE HE SAID THE TIME FARAMIR THE TIME WHEN DID YOU PART WITH THEM WHEN WOULD THEY REACH THAT ACCURSED VALLEY
     I PARTED WITH THEM IN THE MORNING TWO DAYS AGO SAID FARAMIR IT IS FIFTEEN LEAGUES THENCE TO THE VALE OF THE MORGULDUIN IF THEY WENT STRAIGHT SOUTH AND THEN THEY WOULD BE STILL FIVE LEAGUES WESTWARD OF THE ACCURSED TOWER AT SWIFTEST THEY COULD NOT COME THERE BEFORE TODAY AND MAYBE THEY HAVE NOT COME THERE YET INDEED I SEE WHAT YOU FEAR BUT THE DARKNESS IS NOT DUE TO THEIR VENTURE IT BEGAN YESTEREVE AND ALL ITHILIEN WAS UNDER SHADOW LAST NIGHT IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE ENEMY HAS LONG PLANNED AN ASSAULT ON US AND ITS HOUR HAD ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED BEFORE EVER THE TRAVELLERS LEFT MY KEEPING
     GANDALF PACED THE FLOOR THE MORNING OF TWO DAYS AGO NIGH ON THREE DAYS OF JOURNEY HOW FAR IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU PARTED
     SOME TWENTYFIVE LEAGUES AS A BIRD FLIES ANSWERED FARAMIR BUT I COULD NOT COME MORE SWIFTLY YESTEREVE I LAY AT CAIR ANDROS THE LONG ISLE IN THE RIVER NORTHWARD WHICH WE HOLD IN DEFENCE AND HORSES ARE KEPT ON THE HITHER BANK AS THE DARK DREW ON I KNEW THAT HASTE WAS NEEDED SO I RODE THENCE WITH THREE OTHERS THAT COULD ALSO BE HORSED THE REST OF MY COMPANY I SENT SOUTH TO STRENGTHEN THE GARRISON AT THE FORDS OF OSGILIATH I HOPE THAT I HAVE NOT DONE ILL HE LOOKED AT HIS FATHER
     ILL CRIED DENETHOR AND HIS EYES FLASHED SUDDENLY WHY DO YOU ASK THE MEN WERE UNDER YOUR COMMAND OR DO YOU ASK FOR MY JUDGEMENT ON ALL YOUR DEEDS YOUR BEARING IS LOWLY IN MY PRESENCE YET IT IS LONG NOW SINCE YOU TURNED FROM YOUR OWN WAY AT MY COUNSEL SEE YOU HAVE SPOKEN SKILFULLY AS EVER BUT I HAVE I NOT SEEN YOUR EYE FIXED ON MITHRANDIR SEEKING WHETHER YOU SAID WELL OR TOO MUCH HE HAS LONG HAD YOUR HEART IN HIS KEEPING
     MY SON YOUR FATHER IS OLD BUT NOT YET DOTARD I CAN SEE AND HEAR AS WAS MY WONT AND LITTLE OF WHAT YOU HAVE HALF SAID OR LEFT UNSAID IS NOW HIDDEN FROM ME I KNOW THE ANSWER TO MANY RIDDLES ALAS ALAS FOR BOROMIR
     IF WHAT I HAVE DONE DISPLEASES YOU MY FATHER SAID FARAMIR QUIETLY I WISH I HAD KNOWN YOUR COUNSEL BEFORE THE BURDEN OF SO WEIGHTY A JUDGEMENT WAS THRUST ON ME
     WOULD THAT HAVE AVAILED TO CHANGE YOUR JUDGEMENT SAID DENETHOR YOU WOULD STILL HAVE DONE JUST SO I DEEM I KNOW YOU WELL EVER YOUR DESIRE IS TO APPEAR LORDLY AND GENEROUS AS A KING OF OLD GRACIOUS GENTLE THAT MAY WELL BEFIT ONE OF HIGH RACE IF HE SITS IN POWER AND PEACE BUT IN DESPERATE HOURS GENTLENESS MAY BE REPAID WITH DEATH
     SO BE IT SAID FARAMIR
     SO BE IT CRIED DENETHOR BUT NOT WITH YOUR DEATH ONLY LORD FARAMIR WITH THE DEATH ALSO OF YOUR FATHER AND OF ALL YOUR PEOPLE WHOM IT IS YOUR PART TO PROTECT NOW THAT BOROMIR IS GONE
     DO YOU WISH THEN SAID FARAMIR THAT OUR PLACES HAD BEEN EXCHANGED
     YES I WISH THAT INDEED SAID DENETHOR FOR BOROMIR WAS LOYAL TO ME AND NO WIZARDS PUPIL HE WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED HIS FATHERS NEED AND WOULD NOT HAVE SQUANDERED WHAT FORTUNE GAVE HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME A MIGHTY GIFT
     FOR A MOMENT FARAMIRS RESTRAINT GAVE WAY I WOULD ASK YOU MY FATHER TO REMEMBER WHY IT WAS THAT I NOT HE WAS IN ITHILIEN ON ONE OCCASION AT LEAST YOUR COUNSEL HAS PREVAILED NOT LONG AGO IT WAS THE LORD OF THE CITY THAT GAVE THE ERRAND TO HIM
     STIR NOT THE BITTERNESS IN THE CUP THAT I MIXED FOR MYSELF SAID DENETHOR HAVE I NOT TASTED IT NOW MANY NIGHTS UPON MY TONGUE FOREBODING THAT WORSE YET LAY IN THE DREGS AS NOW INDEED I FIND WOULD IT WERE NOT SO WOULD THAT THIS THING HAD COME TO ME
     COMFORT YOURSELF SAID GANDALF IN NO CASE WOULD BOROMIR HAVE BROUGHT IT TO YOU HE IS DEAD AND DIED WELL MAY HE SLEEP IN PEACE YET YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF HE WOULD HAVE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THIS THING AND TAKING IT HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN HE WOULD HAVE KEPT IT FOR HIS OWN AND WHEN HE RETURNED YOU WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN YOUR SON
     THE FACE OF DENETHOR SET HARD AND COLD YOU FOUND BOROMIR LESS APT TO YOUR HAND DID YOU NOT HE SAID SOFTLY BUT I WHO WAS HIS FATHER SAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT TO ME YOU ARE WISE MAYBE MITHRANDIR YET WITH ALL YOUR SUBTLETIES YOU HAVE NOT ALL WISDOM COUNSELS MAY BE FOUND THAT ARE NEITHER THE WEBS OF WIZARDS NOR THE HASTE OF FOOLS I HAVE IN THIS MATTER MORE LORE AND WISDOM THAN YOU DEEM 
     WHAT THEN IS YOUR WISDOM SAID GANDALF
     ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THAT THERE ARE TWO FOLLIES TO AVOID TO USE THIS THING IS PERILOUS AT THIS HOUR TO SEND IT IN THE HANDS OF A WITLESS HALFLING INTO THE LAND OF THE ENEMY HIMSELF AS YOU HAVE DONE AND THIS SON OF MINE THAT IS MADNESS
     AND THE LORD DENETHOR WHAT WOULD HE HAVE DONE
     NEITHER BUT MOST SURELY NOT FOR ANY ARGUMENT WOULD HE HAVE SET THIS THING AT A HAZARD BEYOND ALL BUT A FOOLS HOPE RISKING OUR UTTER RUIN IF THE ENEMY SHOULD RECOVER WHAT HE LOST NAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT HIDDEN HIDDEN DARK AND DEEP NOT USED I SAY UNLESS AT THE UTTERMOST END OF NEED BUT SET BEYOND HIS GRASP SAVE BY A VICTORY SO FINAL THAT WHAT THEN BEFELL WOULD NOT TROUBLE US BEING DEAD
     YOU THINK AS IS YOUR WONT MY LORD OF GONDOR ONLY SAID GANDALF YET THERE ARE OTHER MEN AND OTHER LIVES AND TIME STILL TO BE AND FOR ME I PITY EVEN HIS SLAVES
     AND WHERE WILL OTHER MEN LOOK FOR HELP IF GONDOR FALLS ANSWERED DENETHOR IF I HAD THIS THING NOW IN THE DEEP VAULTS OF THIS CITADEL WE SHOULD NOT THEN SHAKE WITH DREAD UNDER THIS GLOOM FEARING THE WORST AND OUR COUNSELS WOULD BE UNDISTURBED IF YOU DO NOT TRUST ME TO ENDURE THE TEST YOU DO NOT KNOW ME YET
     NONETHELESS I DO NOT TRUST YOU SAID GANDALF HAD I DONE SO I COULD HAVE SENT THIS THING HITHER TO YOUR KEEPING AND SPARED MYSELF AND OTHERS MUCH ANGUISH AND NOW HEARING YOU SPEAK I TRUST YOU LESS NO MORE THAN BOROMIR NAY STAY YOUR WRATH I DO NOT TRUST MYSELF IN THIS AND I REFUSED THIS THING EVEN AS A FREELY GIVEN GIFT YOU ARE STRONG AND CAN STILL IN SOME MATTERS GOVERN YOURSELF DENETHOR YET IF YOU HAD RECEIVED THIS THING IT WOULD HAVE OVERTHROWN YOU WERE IT BURIED BENEATH THE ROOTS OF MINDOLLUIN STILL IT WOULD BURN YOUR MIND AWAY AS THE DARKNESS GROWS AND THE YET WORSE THINGS FOLLOW THAT SOON SHALL COME UPON US
     FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF DENETHOR GLOWED AGAIN AS HE FACED GANDALF AND PIPPIN FELT ONCE MORE THE STRAIN BETWEEN THEIR WILLS BUT NOW ALMOST IT SEEMED AS IF THEIR GLANCES WERE LIKE BLADES FROM EYE TO EYE FLICKERING AS THEY FENCED PIPPIN TREMBLED FEARING SOME DREADFUL STROKE BUT SUDDENLY DENETHOR RELAXED AND GREW COLD AGAIN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
     IF I HAD IF YOU HAD HE SAID SUCH WORDS AND IFS ARE VAIN IT HAS GONE INTO THE SHADOW AND ONLY TIME WILL SHOW WHAT DOOM AWAITS IT AND US THE TIME WILL NOT BE LONG IN WHAT IS LEFT LET ALL WHO FIGHT THE ENEMY IN THEIR FASHION BE AT ONE AND KEEP HOPE WHILE THEY MAY AND AFTER HOPE STILL THE HARDIHOOD TO DIE FREE HE TURNED TO FARAMIR WHAT THINK YOU OF THE GARRISON AT OSGILIATH
     IT IS NOT STRONG SAID FARAMIR I HAVE SENT THE COMPANY OF ITHILIEN TO STRENGTHEN IT AS I HAVE SAID
     NOT ENOUGH I DEEM SAID DENETHOR IT IS THERE THAT THE FIRST BLOW WILL FALL THEY WILL HAVE NEED OF SOME STOUT CAPTAIN THERE
     THERE AND ELSEWHERE IN MANY PLACES SAID FARAMIR AND SIGHED ALAS FOR MY BROTHER WHOM I TOO LOVED HE ROSE MAY I HAVE YOUR LEAVE FATHER AND THEN HE SWAYED AND LEANED UPON HIS FATHERS CHAIR
     YOU ARE WEARY I SEE SAID DENETHOR YOU HAVE RIDDEN FAST AND FAR AND UNDER SHADOWS OF EVIL IN THE AIR I AM TOLD
     LET US NOT SPEAK OF THAT SAID FARAMIR
     THEN WE WILL NOT SAID DENETHOR GO NOW AND REST AS YOU MAY TOMORROWS NEED WILL BE STERNER
     ALL NOW TOOK LEAVE OF THE LORD OF THE CITY AND WENT TO REST WHILE THEY STILL COULD OUTSIDE THERE WAS A STARLESS BLACKNESS AS GANDALF WITH PIPPIN BESIDE HIM BEARING A SMALL TORCH MADE HIS WAY TO THEIR LODGING THEY DID NOT SPEAK UNTIL THEY WERE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THEN AT LAST PIPPIN TOOK GANDALFS HAND
     TELL ME HE SAID IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR FRODO I MEAN OR AT LEAST MOSTLY FOR FRODO
     GANDALF PUT HIS HAND ON PIPPINS HEAD THERE NEVER WAS MUCH HOPE HE ANSWERED JUST A FOOLS HOPE AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD AND WHEN I HEARD OF CIRITH UNGOL HE BROKE OFF AND STRODE TO THE WINDOW AS IF HIS EYES COULD PIERCE THE NIGHT IN THE EAST CIRITH UNGOL HE MUTTERED WHY THAT WAY I WONDER HE TURNED JUST NOW PIPPIN MY HEART ALMOST FAILED ME HEARING THAT NAME AND YET IN TRUTH I BELIEVE THAT THE NEWS THAT FARAMIR BRINGS HAS SOME HOPE IN IT FOR IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT OUR ENEMY HAS OPENED HIS WAR AT LAST AND MADE THE FIRST MOVE WHILE FRODO WAS STILL FREE SO NOW FOR MANY DAYS HE WILL HAVE HIS EYE TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT AWAY FROM HIS OWN LAND AND YET PIPPIN I FEEL FROM AFAR HIS HASTE AND FEAR HE HAS BEGUN SOONER THAN HE WOULD SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO STIR HIM
     GANDALF STOOD FOR A MOMENT IN THOUGHT MAYBE HE MUTTERED MAYBE EVEN YOUR FOOLISHNESS HELPED MY LAD LET ME SEE SOME FIVE DAYS AGO NOW HE WOULD DISCOVER THAT WE HAD THROWN DOWN SARUMAN AND HAD TAKEN THE STONE STILL WHAT OF THAT WE COULD NOT USE IT TO MUCH PURPOSE OR WITHOUT HIS KNOWING AH I WONDER ARAGORN HIS TIME DRAWS NEAR AND HE IS STRONG AND STERN UNDERNEATH PIPPIN BOLD DETERMINED ABLE TO TAKE HIS OWN COUNSEL AND DARE GREAT RISKS AT NEED THAT MAY BE IT HE MAY HAVE USED THE STONE AND SHOWN HIMSELF TO THE ENEMY CHALLENGING HIM FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I WONDER WELL WE SHALL NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TILL THE RIDERS OF ROHAN COME IF THEY DO NOT COME TOO LATE THERE ARE EVIL DAYS AHEAD TO SLEEP WHILE WE MAY
     BUT SAID PIPPIN
     BUT WHAT SAID GANDALF ONLY ONE BUT WILL I ALLOW TONIGHT
     GOLLUM SAID PIPPIN HOW ON EARTH COULD THEY BE GOING ABOUT WITH HIM EVEN FOLLOWING HIM AND I COULD SEE THAT FARAMIR DID NOT LIKE THE PLACE HE WAS TAKING THEM TO ANY MORE THAN YOU DO WHAT IS WRONG
     I CANNOT ANSWER THAT NOW SAID GANDALF YET MY HEART GUESSED THAT FRODO AND GOLLUM WOULD MEET BEFORE THE END FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL BUT OF CIRITH UNGOL I WILL NOT SPEAK TONIGHT TREACHERY TREACHERY I FEAR TREACHERY OF THAT MISERABLE CREATURE BUT SO IT MUST BE LET US REMEMBER THAT A TRAITOR MAY BETRAY HIMSELF AND DO GOOD THAT HE DOES NOT INTEND IT CAN BE SO SOMETIMES GOOD NIGHT 
     THE NEXT DAY CAME WITH A MORNING LIKE A BROWN DUSK AND THE HEARTS OF MEN LIFTED FOR A WHILE BY THE RETURN OF FARAMIR SANK LOW AGAIN THE WINGED SHADOWS WERE NOT SEEN AGAIN THAT DAY YET EVER AND ANON HIGH ABOVE THE CITY A FAINT CRY WOULD COME AND MANY WHO HEARD IT WOULD STAND STRICKEN WITH A PASSING DREAD WHILE THE LESS STOUTHEARTED QUAILED AND WEPT
     AND NOW FARAMIR WAS GONE AGAIN THEY GIVE HIM NO REST SOME MURMURED THE LORD DRIVES HIS SON TOO HARD AND NOW HE MUST DO THE DUTY OF TWO FOR HIMSELF AND FOR THE ONE THAT WILL NOT RETURN AND EVER MEN LOOKED NORTHWARD ASKING WHERE ARE THE RIDERS OF ROHAN
     IN TRUTH FARAMIR DID NOT GO BY HIS OWN CHOOSING BUT THE LORD OF THE CITY WAS MASTER OF HIS COUNCIL AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD THAT DAY TO BOW TO OTHERS EARLY IN THE MORNING THE COUNCIL HAD BEEN SUMMONED THERE ALL THE CAPTAINS JUDGED THAT BECAUSE OF THE THREAT IN THE SOUTH THEIR FORCE WAS TOO WEAK TO MAKE ANY STROKE OF WAR ON THEIR OWN PART UNLESS PERCHANCE THE RIDERS OF ROHAN YET SHOULD COME MEANWHILE THEY MUST MAN THE WALLS AND WAIT
     YET SAID DENETHOR WE SHOULD NOT LIGHTLY ABANDON THE OUTER DEFENCES THE RAMMAS MADE WITH SO GREAT A LABOUR AND THE ENEMY MUST PAY DEARLY FOR THE CROSSING OF THE RIVER THAT HE CANNOT DO IN FORCE TO ASSAIL THE CITY EITHER NORTH OF CAIR ANDROS BECAUSE OF THE MARSHES OR SOUTHWARDS TOWARDS LEBENNIN BECAUSE OF THE BREADTH OF THE RIVER THAT NEEDS MANY BOATS IT IS AT OSGILIATH THAT HE WILL PUT HIS WEIGHT AS BEFORE WHEN BOROMIR DENIED HIM THE PASSAGE
     THAT WAS BUT A TRIAL SAID FARAMIR TODAY WE MAY MAKE THE ENEMY PAY TEN TIMES OUR LOSS AT THE PASSAGE AND YET RUE THE EXCHANGE FOR HE CAN AFFORD TO LOSE A HOST BETTER THAN WE TO LOSE A COMPANY AND THE RETREAT OF THOSE THAT WE PUT OUT FAR AFIELD WILL BE PERILOUS IF HE WINS ACROSS IN FORCE
     AND WHAT OF CAIR ANDROS SAID THE PRINCE THAT TOO MUST BE HELD IF OSGILIATH IS DEFENDED LET US NOT FORGET THE DANGER ON OUR LEFT THE ROHIRRIM MAY COME AND THEY MAY NOT BUT FARAMIR HAS TOLD US OF GREAT STRENGTH DRAWING EVER TO THE BLACK GATE MORE THAN ONE HOST MAY ISSUE FROM IT AND STRIKE FOR MORE THAN ONE PASSAGE
     MUCH MUST BE RISKED IN WAR SAID DENETHOR CAIR ANDROS IS MANNED AND NO MORE CAN BE SENT SO FAR BUT I WILL NOT YIELD THE RIVER AND THE PELENNOR UNFOUGHT  NOT IF THERE IS A CAPTAIN HERE WHO HAS STILL THE COURAGE TO DO HIS LORDS WILL
     THEN ALL WERE SILENT BUT AT LENGTH FARAMIR SAID I DO NOT OPPOSE YOUR WILL SIRE SINCE YOU ARE ROBBED OF BOROMIR I WILL GO AND DO WHAT I CAN IN HIS STEAD  IF YOU COMMAND IT
     I DO SO SAID DENETHOR
     THEN FAREWELL SAID FARAMIR BUT IF I SHOULD RETURN THINK BETTER OF ME
     THAT DEPENDS ON THE MANNER OF YOUR RETURN SAID DENETHOR
     GANDALF IT WAS THAT LAST SPOKE TO FARAMIR ERE HE RODE EAST DO NOT THROW YOUR LIVE AWAY RASHLY OR IN BITTERNESS HE SAID YOU WILL BE NEEDED HERE FOR OTHER THINGS THAN WAR YOUR FATHER LOVES YOU FARAMIR AND WILL REMEMBER IT ERE THE END FAREWELL
     SO NOW THE LORD FARAMIR HAD GONE FORTH AGAIN AND HAD TAKEN WITH HIM SUCH STRENGTH OF MEN AS WERE WILLING TO GO OR COULD BE SPARED ON THE WALLS SOME GAZED THROUGH THE GLOOM TOWARDS THE RUINED CITY AND THEY WONDERED WHAT CHANCED THERE FOR NOTHING COULD BE SEEN AND OTHERS AS EVER LOOKED NORTH AND COUNTED THE LEAGUES TO TH
     YES HE WILL COME SAID GANDALF EVEN IF HE COMES TOO LATE BUT THINK AT BEST THE RED ARROW CANNOT HAVE REACHED HIM MORE THAN TWO DAYS AGO AND THE MILES ARE LONG FROM EDORAS
     IT WAS NIGHT AGAIN ERE NEWS CAME A MAN RODE IN HASTE FROM THE FORDS SAYING THAT A HOST HAD ISSUED FROM MINAS MORGUL AND WAS ALREADY DRAWING NIGH TO OSGILIATH AND IT HAD BEEN JOINED BY REGIMENTS FROM THE SOUTH HARADRIM CRUEL AND TALL AND WE HAVE LEARNED SAID THE MESSENGER THAT THE BLACK CAPTAIN LEADS THEM ONCE AGAIN AND THE FEAR OF HIM HAS PASSED BEFORE HIM OVER THE RIVER
     WITH THOSE ILLBODING WORDS THE THIRD DAY CLOSED SINCE PIPPIN CAME TO MINAS TIRITH FEW WENT TO REST FOR SMALL HOPE HAD ANY NOW THAT EVEN FARAMIR COULD HOLD THE FORDS FOR LONG
     THE NEXT DAY THOUGH THE DARKNESS HAD REACHED ITS FULL AND GREW NO DEEPER IT WEIGHED HEAVIER ON MENS HEARTS AND A GREAT DREAD WAS ON THEM ILL NEWS CAME SOON AGAIN THE PASSAGE OF ANDUIN WAS WON BY THE ENEMY FARAMIR WAS RETREATING TO THE WALL OF THE PELENNOR RALLYING HIS MEN TO THE CAUSEWAY FORTS BUT HE WAS TEN TIMES OUTNUMBERED
     IF HE WINS BACK AT ALL ACROSS THE PELENNOR HIS ENEMIES WILL BE ON HIS HEELS SAID THE MESSENGER THEY HAVE PAID DEAR FOR THE CROSSING BUT LESS DEARLY THAN WE HOPED THE PLAN HAS BEEN WELL LAID IT IS NOW SEEN THAT IN SECRET THEY HAVE LONG BEEN BUILDING FLOATS AND BARGES IN GREAT NUMBERS IN EAST OSGILIATH THEY SWARMED ACROSS LIKE BEETLES BUT IT IS THE BLACK CAPTAIN THAT DEFEATS US FEW WILL STAND AND ABIDE EVEN THE RUMOUR OF HIS COMING HIS OWN FOLK QUAIL AT HIM AND THEY WOULD SLAY THEMSELVES AT HIS BIDDING
     THEN I AM NEEDED THERE MORE THAN HERE SAID GANDALF AND RODE OFF AT ONCE AND THE GLIMMER OF HIM FADED SOON FROM SIGHT AND ALL THAT NIGHT PIPPIN ALONE AND SLEEPLESS STOOD UPON THE WALL AND GAZED EASTWARD
     THE BELLS OF DAY HAD SCARCELY RUNG OUT AGAIN A MOCKERY IN THE UNLIGHTENED DARK WHEN FAR AWAY HE SAW FIRES SPRING UP ACROSS IN THE DIM SPACES WHERE THE WALLS OF THE PELENNOR STOOD THE WATCHMEN CRIED ALOUD AND ALL MEN IN THE CITY STOOD TO ARMS NOW EVER AND ANON THERE WAS A RED FLASH AND SLOWLY THROUGH THE HEAVY AIR DULL RUMBLES COULD BE HEARD
     THEY HAVE TAKEN THE WALL MEN CRIED THEY ARE BLASTING BREACHES IN IT THEY ARE COMING
     WHERE IS FARAMIR CRIED BEREGOND IN DISMAY SAY NOT THAT HE HAS FALLEN
     IT WAS GANDALF THAT BROUGHT THE FIRST TIDINGS WITH A HANDFUL OF HORSEMEN HE CAME IN THE MIDDLE MORNING RIDING AS ESCORT TO A LINE OF WAINS THEY WERE FILLED WITH WOUNDED MEN ALL THAT COULD BE SAVED FROM THE WRECK OF THE CAUSEWAY FORTS AT ONCE HE WENT TO DENETHOR THE LORD OF THE CITY SAT NOW IN A HIGH CHAMBER ABOVE THE HALL OF THE WHITE TOWER WITH PIPPIN AT HIS SIDE AND THROUGH THE DIM WINDOWS NORTH AND SOUTH AND EAST HE BENT HIS DARK EYES AS IF TO PIERCE THE SHADOWS OF DOOM THAT RINGED HIM ROUND MOST TO THE NORTH HE LOOKED AND WOULD PAUSE AT WHILES TO LISTEN AS IF BY SOME ANCIENT ART HIS EARS MIGHT HEAR THE THUNDER OF HOOFS ON THE PLAINS FAR AWAY
     IS FARAMIR COME HE ASKED
     NO SAID GANDALF BUT HE STILL LIVED WHEN I LEFT HIM YET HE IS RESOLVED TO STAY WITH THE REARGUARD LEST THE RETREAT OVER THE PELENNOR BECOME A ROUT HE MAY PERHAPS HOLD HIS MEN TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH BUT I DOUBT IT HE IS PITTED AGAINST A FOE TOO GREAT FOR ONE HAS COME THAT I FEARED
     NOT  THE DARK LORD CRIED PIPPIN FORGETTING HIS PLACE IN HIS TERROR
     DENETHOR LAUGHED BITTERLY NAY NOT YET MASTER PEREGRIN HE WILL NOT COME SAVE ONLY TO TRIUMPH OVER ME WHEN ALL IS WON HE USES OTHERS AS HIS WEAPONS SO DO ALL GREAT LORDS IF THEY ARE WISE MASTER HALFLING OR WHY SHOULD I SIT HERE IN MY TOWER AND THINK AND WATCH AND WAIT SPENDING EVEN MY SONS FOR I CAN STILL WIELD A BRAND
     HE STOOD UP AND CAST OPEN HIS LONG BLACK CLOAK AND BEHOLD HE WAS CLAD IN MAIL BENEATH AND GIRT WITH A LONG SWORD GREATHILTED IN A SHEATH OF BLACK AND SILVER THUS HAVE I WALKED AND THUS NOW FOR MANY YEARS HAVE I SLEPT HE SAID LEST WITH AGE THE BODY SHOULD GROW SOFT AND TIMID
     YET NOW UNDER THE LORD OF BARADDUR THE MOST FELL OF ALL HIS CAPTAINS IS ALREADY MASTER OF YOUR OUTER WALLS SAID GANDALF KING OF ANGMAR LONG AGO SORCERER RINGWRAITH LORD OF THE NAZG
     THEN MITHRANDIR YOU HAD A FOE TO MATCH YOU SAID DENETHOR FOR MYSELF I HAVE LONG KNOWN WHO IS THE CHIEF CAPTAIN OF THE HOSTS OF THE DARK TOWER IS THIS ALL THAT YOU HAVE RETURNED TO SAY OR CAN IT BE THAT YOU HAVE WITHDRAWN BECAUSE YOU ARE OVERMATCHED
     PIPPIN TREMBLED FEARING THAT GANDALF WOULD BE STUNG TO SUDDEN WRATH BUT HIS FEAR WAS NEEDLESS IT MIGHT BE SO GANDALF ANSWERED SOFTLY BUT OUR TRIAL OF STRENGTH IS NOT YET COME AND IF WORDS SPOKEN OF OLD BE TRUE NOT BY THE HAND OF MAN SHALL HE FALL AND HIDDEN FROM THE WISE IS THE DOOM THAT AWAITS HIM HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THE CAPTAIN OF DESPAIR DOES NOT PRESS FORWARD YET HE RULES RATHER ACCORDING TO THE WISDOM THAT YOU HAVE JUST SPOKEN FROM THE REAR DRIVING HIS SLAVES IN MADNESS ON BEFORE
     NAY I CAME RATHER TO GUARD THE HURT MEN THAT CAN YET BE HEALED FOR THE RAMMAS IS BREACHED FAR AND WIDE AND SOON THE HOST OF MORGUL WILL ENTER IN AT MANY POINTS AND I CAME CHIEFLY TO SAY THIS SOON THERE WILL BE BATTLE ON THE FIELDS A SORTIE MUST BE MADE READY LET IT BE OF MOUNTED MEN IN THEM LIES OUR BRIEF HOPE FOR IN ONE THING ONLY IS THE ENEMY STILL POORLY PROVIDED HE HAS FEW HORSEMEN
     AND WE ALSO HAVE FEW NOW WOULD THE COMING OF ROHAN BE IN THE NICK OF TIME SAID DENETHOR
     WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE OTHER NEWCOMERS FIRST SAID GANDALF FUGITIVES FROM CAIR ANDROS HAVE ALREADY REACHED US THE ISLE HAS FALLEN ANOTHER ARMY IS COME FROM THE BLACK GATE CROSSING FROM THE NORTHEAST
     SOME HAVE ACCUSED YOU MITHRANDIR OF DELIGHTING TO BEAR ILL NEWS SAID DENETHOR BUT TO ME THIS IS NO LONGER NEWS IT WAS KNOWN TO ME ERE NIGHTFALL YESTERDAY AS FOR THE SORTIE I HAD ALREADY GIVEN THOUGHT TO IT LET US GO DOWN
     TIME PASSED AT LENGTH WATCHERS ON THE WALLS COULD SEE THE RETREAT OF THE OUTCOMPANIES SMALL BANDS OF WEARY AND OFTEN WOUNDED MEN CAME FIRST WITH LITTLE ORDER SOME WERE RUNNING WILDLY AS IF PURSUED AWAY TO THE EASTWARD THE DISTANT FIRES FLICKERED AND NOW IT SEEMED THAT HERE AND THERE THEY CREPT ACROSS THE PLAIN HOUSES AND BARNS WERE BURNING THEN FROM MANY POINTS LITTLE RIVERS OF RED FLAME CAME HURRYING ON WINDING THROUGH THE GLOOM CONVERGING TOWARDS THE LINE OF THE BROAD ROAD THAT LED FROM THE CITYGATE TO OSGILIATH
     THE ENEMY MEN MURMURED THE DIKE IS DOWN HERE THEY COME POURING THROUGH THE BREACHES AND THEY CARRY TORCHES IT SEEMS WHERE ARE OUR OWN FOLK
     IT DREW NOW TO EVENING BY THE HOUR AND THE LIGHT WAS SO DIM THAT EVEN FARSIGHTED MEN UPON THE CITADEL COULD DISCERN LITTLE CLEARLY OUT UPON THE FIELDS SAVE ONLY THE BURNINGS THAT EVER MULTIPLIED AND THE LINES OF FIRE THAT GREW IN LENGTH AND SPEED AT LAST LESS THAN A MILE FROM THE CITY A MORE ORDERED MASS OF MEN CAME INTO VIEW MARCHING NOT RUNNING STILL HOLDING TOGETHER
     THE WATCHERS HELD THEIR BREATH FARAMIR MUST BE THERE THEY SAID HE CAN GOVERN MAN AND BEAST HE WILL MAKE IT YET
     NOW THE MAIN RETREAT WAS SCARCELY TWO FURLONGS DISTANT OUT OF THE GLOOM BEHIND A SMALL COMPANY OF HORSEMEN GALLOPED ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE REARGUARD ONCE AGAIN THEY TURNED AT BAY FACING THE ONCOMING LINES OF FIRE THEN SUDDENLY THERE WAS A TUMULT OF FIERCE CRIES HORSEMEN OF THE ENEMY SWEPT UP THE LINES OF FIRE BECAME FLOWING TORRENTS FILE UPON FILE OF ORCS BEARING FLAMES AND WILD SOUTHRON MEN WITH RED BANNERS SHOUTING WITH HARSH TONGUES SURGING UP OVERTAKING THE RETREAT AND WITH A PIERCING CRY OUT OF THE DIM SKY FELL THE WINGED SHADOWS THE NAZG
     THE RETREAT BECAME A ROUT ALREADY MEN WERE BREAKING AWAY FLYING WILD AND WITLESS HERE AND THERE FLINGING AWAY THEIR WEAPONS CRYING OUT IN FEAR FALLING TO THE GROUND
     AND THEN A TRUMPET RANG FROM THE CITADEL AND DENETHOR AT LAST RELEASED THE SORTIE DRAWN UP WITHIN THE SHADOW OF THE GATE AND UNDER THE LOOMING WALLS OUTSIDE THEY HAD WAITED FOR HIS SIGNAL ALL THE MOUNTED MEN THAT WERE LEFT IN THE CITY NOW THEY SPRANG FORWARD FORMED QUICKENED TO A GALLOP AND CHARGED WITH A GREAT SHOUT AND FROM THE WALLS AN ANSWERING SHOUT WENT UP FOR FOREMOST ON THE FIELD RODE THE SWANKNIGHTS OF DOL AMROTH WITH THEIR PRINCE AND HIS BLUE BANNER AT THEIR HEAD
     AMROTH FOR GONDOR THEY CRIED AMROTH TO FARAMIR
     LIKE THUNDER THEY BROKE UPON THE ENEMY ON EITHER FLANK OF THE RETREAT BUT ONE RIDER OUTRAN THEM ALL SWIFT AS THE WIND IN THE GRASS SHADOWFAX BORE HIM SHINING UNVEILED ONCE MORE A LIGHT STARTING FROM HIS UPRAISED HAND
     THE NAZGBECAME THE HUNTED THE RETREAT BECAME AN ONSLAUGHT THE FIELD WAS STREWN WITH STRICKEN ORCS AND MEN AND A REEK AROSE OF TORCHES CAST AWAY SPUTTERING OUT IN SWIRLING SMOKE THE CAVALRY RODE ON
     
     BUT DENETHOR DID NOT PERMIT THEM TO GO FAR THOUGH THE ENEMY WAS CHECKED AND FOR THE MOMENT DRIVEN BACK GREAT FORCES WERE FLOWING IN FROM THE EAST AGAIN THE TRUMPET RANG SOUNDING THE RETREAT THE CAVALRY OF GONDOR HALTED BEHIND THEIR SCREEN THE OUTCOMPANIES REFORMED NOW STEADILY THEY CAME MARCHING BACK THEY REACHED THE GATE OF THE CITY AND ENTERED STEPPING PROUDLY AND PROUDLY THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY LOOKED ON THEM AND CRIED THEIR PRAISE AND YET THEY WERE TROUBLED IN HEART FOR THE COMPANIES WERE GRIEVOUSLY REDUCED FARAMIR HAD LOST A THIRD OF HIS MEN AND WHERE WAS HE
     LAST OF ALL HE CAME HIS MEN PASSED IN THE MOUNTED KNIGHTS RETURNED AND AT THEIR REAR THE BANNER OF DOL AMROTH AND THE PRINCE AND IN HIS ARMS BEFORE HIM ON HIS HORSE HE BORE THE BODY OF HIS KINSMAN FARAMIR SON OF DENETHOR FOUND UPON THE STRICKEN FIELD
     FARAMIR FARAMIR MEN CRIED WEEPING IN THE STREETS BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER AND THEY BORE HIM AWAY UP THE WINDING ROAD TO THE CITADEL AND HIS FATHER EVEN AS THE NAZG
     THE PRINCE IMRAHIL BROUGHT FARAMIR TO THE WHITE TOWER AND HE SAID YOUR SON HAS RETURNED LORD AFTER GREAT DEEDS AND HE TOLD ALL THAT HE HAD SEEN BUT DENETHOR ROSE AND LOOKED ON THE FACE OF HIS SON AND WAS SILENT THEN HE BADE THEM MAKE A BED IN THE CHAMBER AND LAY FARAMIR UPON IT AND DEPART BUT HE HIMSELF WENT UP ALONE INTO THE SECRET ROOM UNDER THE SUMMIT OF THE TOWER AND MANY WHO LOOKED UP THITHER AT THAT TIME SAW A PALE LIGHT THAT GLEAMED AND FLICKERED FROM THE NARROW WINDOWS FOR A WHILE AND THEN FLASHED AND WENT OUT AND WHEN DENETHOR DESCENDED AGAIN HE WENT TO FARAMIR AND SAT BESIDE HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD WAS GREY MORE DEATHLIKE THAN HIS SONS
     SO NOW AT LAST THE CITY WAS BESIEGED ENCLOSED IN A RING OF FOES THE RAMMAS WAS BROKEN AND ALL THE PELENNOR ABANDONED TO THE ENEMY THE LAST WORD TO COME FROM OUTSIDE THE WALLS WAS BROUGHT BY MEN FLYING DOWN THE NORTHWARD ROAD ERE THE GATE WAS SHUT THEY WERE THE REMNANT OF THE GUARD THAT WAS KEPT AT THAT POINT WHERE THE WAY FROM AN
     THERE IS NO NEWS OF THE ROHIRRIM HE SAID ROHAN WILL NOT COME NOW OR IF THEY COME IT WILL NOT AVAIL US THE NEW HOST THAT WE HAD TIDINGS OF HAS COME FIRST FROM OVER THE RIVER BY WAY OF ANDROS IT IS SAID THEY ARE STRONG BATTALIONS OF ORCS OF THE EYE AND COUNTLESS COMPANIES OF MEN OF A NEW SORT THAT WE HAVE NOT MET BEFORE NOT TALL BUT BROAD AND GRIM BEARDED LIKE DWARVES WIELDING GREAT AXES OUT OF SOME SAVAGE LAND IN THE WIDE EAST THEY COME WE DEEM THEY HOLD THE NORTHWARD ROAD AND MANY HAVE PASSED ON INTO AN
     THE GATE WAS SHUT ALL NIGHT WATCHMEN ON THE WALLS HEARD THE RUMOUR OF THE ENEMY THAT ROAMED OUTSIDE BURNING FIELD AND TREE AND HEWING ANY MAN THAT THEY FOUND ABROAD LIVING OR DEAD THE NUMBERS THAT HAD ALREADY PASSED OVER THE RIVER COULD NOT BE GUESSED IN THE DARKNESS BUT WHEN MORNING OR ITS DIM SHADOW STOLE OVER THE PLAIN IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN FEAR BY NIGHT HAD SCARCELY OVERCOUNTED THEM THE PLAIN WAS DARK WITH THEIR MARCHING COMPANIES AND AS FAR AS EYES COULD STRAIN IN THE MIRK THERE SPROUTED LIKE A FOUL FUNGUSGROWTH ALL ABOUT THE BELEAGUERED CITY GREAT CAMPS OF TENTS BLACK OR SOMBRE RED
     BUSY AS ANTS HURRYING ORCS WERE DIGGING DIGGING LINES OF DEEP TRENCHES IN A HUGE RING JUST OUT OF BOWSHOT FROM THE WALLS AND AS THE TRENCHES WERE MADE EACH WAS FILLED WITH FIRE THOUGH HOW IT WAS KINDLED OR FED BY ART OR DEVILRY NONE COULD SEE ALL DAY THE LABOUR WENT FORWARD WHILE THE MEN OF MINAS TIRITH LOOKED ON UNABLE TO HINDER IT AND AS EACH LENGTH OF TRENCH WAS COMPLETED THEY COULD SEE GREAT WAINS APPROACHING AND SOON YET MORE COMPANIES OF THE ENEMY WERE SWIFTLY SETTING UP EACH BEHIND THE COVER OF A TRENCH GREAT ENGINES FOR THE CASTING OF MISSILES THERE WERE NONE UPON THE CITY WALLS LARGE ENOUGH TO REACH SO FAR OR TO STAY THE WORK
     AT FIRST MEN LAUGHED AND DID NOT GREATLY FEAR SUCH DEVICES FOR THE MAIN WALL OF THE CITY WAS OF GREAT HEIGHT AND MARVELLOUS THICKNESS BUILT ERE THE POWER AND CRAFT OF N
     NAY THEY SAID NOT IF THE NAMELESS ONE HIMSELF SHOULD COME NOT EVEN HE COULD ENTER HERE WHILE WE YET LIVE BUT SOME ANSWERED WHILE WE YET LIVE HOW LONG HE HAS A WEAPON THAT HAS BROUGHT LOW MANY STRONG PLACES SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN HUNGER THE ROADS ARE CUT ROHAN WILL NOT COME
     BUT THE ENGINES DID NOT WASTE SHOT UPON THE INDOMITABLE WALL IT WAS NO BRIGAND OR ORCCHIEFTAIN THAT ORDERED THE ASSAULT UPON THE LORD OF MORDORS GREATEST FOE A POWER AND MIND OF MALICE GUIDED IT AS SOON AS THE GREAT CATAPULTS WERE SET WITH MANY YELLS AND THE CREAKING OF ROPE AND WINCH THEY BEGAN TO THROW MISSILES MARVELLOUSLY HIGH SO THAT THEY PASSED RIGHT ABOVE THE BATTLEMENT AND FELL THUDDING WITHIN THE FIRST CIRCLE OF THE CITY AND MANY OF THEM BY SOME SECRET ART BURST INTO FLAME AS THEY CAME TOPPLING DOWN
     SOON THERE WAS GREAT PERIL OF FIRE BEHIND THE WALL AND ALL WHO COULD BE SPARED WERE BUSY QUELLING THE FLAMES THAT SPRANG UP IN MANY PLACES THEN AMONG THE GREATER CASTS THERE FELL ANOTHER HAIL LESS RUINOUS BUT MORE HORRIBLE ALL ABOUT THE STREETS AND LANES BEHIND THE GATE IT TUMBLED DOWN SMALL ROUND SHOT THAT DID NOT BURN BUT WHEN MEN RAN TO LEARN WHAT IT MIGHT BE THEY CRIED ALOUD OR WEPT FOR THE ENEMY WAS FLINGING INTO THE CITY ALL THE HEADS OF THOSE WHO HAD FALLEN FIGHTING AT OSGILIATH OR ON THE RAMMAS OR IN THE FIELDS THEY WERE GRIM TO LOOK ON FOR THOUGH SOME WERE CRUSHED AND SHAPELESS AND SOME HAD BEEN CRUELLY HEWN YET MANY HAD FEATURES THAT COULD BE TOLD AND IT SEEMED THAT THEY HAD DIED IN PAIN AND ALL WERE BRANDED WITH THE FOUL TOKEN OF THE LIDLESS EYE BUT MARRED AND DISHONOURED AS THEY WERE IT OFTEN CHANCED THAT THUS A MAN WOULD SEE AGAIN THE FACE OF SOMEONE THAT HE HAD KNOWN WHO HAD WALKED PROUDLY ONCE IN ARMS OR TILLED THE FIELDS OR RIDDEN IN UPON A HOLIDAY FROM THE GREEN VALES IN THE HILLS
     IN VAIN MEN SHOOK THEIR FISTS AT THE PITILESS FOES THAT SWARMED BEFORE THE GATE CURSES THEY HEEDED NOT NOR UNDERSTOOD THE TONGUES OF WESTERN MEN CRYING WITH HARSH VOICES LIKE BEASTS AND CARRIONBIRDS BUT SOON THERE WERE FEW LEFT IN MINAS TIRITH WHO HAD THE HEART TO STAND UP AND DEFY THE HOSTS OF MORDOR FOR YET ANOTHER WEAPON SWIFTER THAN HUNGER THE LORD OF THE DARK TOWER HAD DREAD AND DESPAIR
     THE NAZGD YET WERE EVER PRESENT AND THEIR DEADLY VOICES RENT THE AIR MORE UNBEARABLE THEY BECAME NOT LESS AT EACH NEW CRY AT LENGTH EVEN THE STOUTHEARTED WOULD FLING THEMSELVES TO THE GROUND AS THE HIDDEN MENACE PASSED OVER THEM OR THEY WOULD STAND LETTING THEIR WEAPONS FALL FROM NERVELESS HANDS WHILE INTO THEIR MINDS A BLACKNESS CAME AND THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF WAR BUT ONLY OF HIDING AND OF CRAWLING AND OF DEATH
     DURING ALL THIS BLACK DAY FARAMIR LAY UPON HIS BED IN THE CHAMBER OF THE WHITE TOWER WANDERING IN A DESPERATE FEVER DYING SOMEONE SAID AND SOON DYING ALL MEN WERE SAYING UPON THE WALLS AND IN THE STREETS AND BY HIM HIS FATHER SAT AND SAID NOTHING BUT WATCHED AND GAVE NO LONGER ANY HEED TO THE DEFENCE
     NO HOURS SO DARK HAD PIPPIN KNOWN NOT EVEN IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE URUKHAI IT WAS HIS DUTY TO WAIT UPON THE LORD AND WAIT HE DID FORGOTTEN IT SEEMED STANDING BY THE DOOR OF THE UNLIT CHAMBER MASTERING HIS OWN FEARS AS BEST HE COULD AND AS HE WATCHED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT DENETHOR GREW OLD BEFORE HIS EYES AS IF SOMETHING HAD SNAPPED IN HIS PROUD WILL AND HIS STERN MIND WAS OVERTHROWN GRIEF MAYBE HAD WROUGHT IT AND REMORSE HE SAW TEARS ON THAT ONCE TEARLESS FACE MORE UNBEARABLE THAN WRATH
     DO NOT WEEP LORD HE STAMMERED PERHAPS HE WILL GET WELL HAVE YOU ASKED GANDALF
     COMFORT ME NOT WITH WIZARDS SAID DENETHOR THE FOOLS HOPE HAS FAILED THE ENEMY HAS FOUND IT AND NOW HIS POWER WAXES HE SEES OUR VERY THOUGHTS AND ALL WE DO IS RUINOUS
     I SENT MY SON FORTH UNTHANKED UNBLESSED OUT INTO NEEDLESS PERIL AND HERE HE LIES WITH POISON IN HIS VEINS NAY NAY WHATEVER MAY NOW BETIDE IN WAR MY LINE TOO IS ENDING EVEN THE HOUSE OF THE STEWARDS HAS FAILED MEAN FOLK SHALL RULE THE LAST REMNANT OF THE KINGS OF MEN LURKING IN THE HILLS UNTIL ALL ARE HOUNDED OUT
     MEN CAME TO THE DOOR CRYING FOR THE LORD OF THE CITY NAY I WILL NOT COME DOWN HE SAID I MUST STAY BESIDE MY SON HE MIGHT STILL SPEAK BEFORE THE END BUT THAT IS NEAR FOLLOW WHOM YOU WILL EVEN THE GREY FOOL THOUGH HIS HOPE HAS FAILED HERE I STAY
     SO IT WAS THAT GANDALF TOOK COMMAND OF THE LAST DEFENCE OF THE CITY OF GONDOR WHEREVER HE CAME MENS HEARTS WOULD LIFT AGAIN AND THE WINGED SHADOWS PASS FROM MEMORY TIRELESSLY HE STRODE FROM CITADEL TO GATE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ABOUT THE WALL AND WITH HIM WENT THE PRINCE OF DOL AMROTH IN HIS SHINING MAIL FOR HE AND HIS KNIGHTS STILL HELD THEMSELVES LIKE LORDS IN WHOM THE RACE OF N OF ANDUIN OUT OF VANISHED YEARS
     AND YET  WHEN THEY HAD GONE THE SHADOWS CLOSED ON MEN AGAIN AND THEIR HEARTS WENT COLD AND THE VALOUR OF GONDOR WITHERED INTO ASH AND SO SLOWLY THEY PASSED OUT OF A DIM DAY OF FEARS INTO THE DARKNESS OF A DESPERATE NIGHT FIRES NOW RAGED UNCHECKED IN THE FIRST CIRCLE OF THE CITY AND THE GARRISON UPON THE OUTER WALL WAS ALREADY IN MANY PLACES CUT OFF FROM RETREAT BUT THE FAITHFUL WHO REMAINED THERE AT THEIR POSTS WERE FEW MOST HAD FLED BEYOND THE SECOND GATE
     FAR BEHIND THE BATTLE THE RIVER HAD BEEN SWIFTLY BRIDGED AND ALL DAY MORE FORCE AND GEAR OF WAR HAD POURED ACROSS NOW AT LAST IN THE MIDDLE NIGHT THE ASSAULT WAS LOOSED THE VANGUARD PASSED THROUGH THE TRENCHES OF FIRE BY MANY DEVIOUS PATHS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BETWEEN THEM ON THEY CAME RECKLESS OF THEIR LOSS AS THEY APPROACHED STILL BUNCHED AND HERDED WITHIN THE RANGE OF BOWMEN ON THE WALL BUT INDEED THERE WERE TOO FEW NOW LEFT THERE TO DO THEM GREAT DAMAGE THOUGH THE LIGHT OF THE FIRES SHOWED UP MANY A MARK FOR ARCHERS OF SUCH SKILL AS GONDOR ONCE HAD BOASTED THEN PERCEIVING THAT THE VALOUR OF THE CITY WAS ALREADY BEATEN DOWN THE HIDDEN CAPTAIN PUT FORTH HIS STRENGTH SLOWLY THE GREAT SIEGETOWERS BUILT IN OSGILIATH ROLLED FORWARD THROUGH THE DARK
     MESSENGERS CAME AGAIN TO THE CHAMBER IN THE WHITE TOWER AND PIPPIN LET THEM ENTER FOR THEY WERE URGENT DENETHOR TURNED HIS HEAD SLOWLY FROM FARAMIRS FACE AND LOOKED AT THEM SILENTLY
     THE FIRST CIRCLE OF THE CITY IS BURNING LORD THEY SAID WHAT ARE YOUR COMMANDS YOU ARE STILL THE LORD AND STEWARD NOT ALL WILL FOLLOW MITHRANDIR MEN ARE FLYING FROM THE WALLS AND LEAVING THEM UNMANNED
     WHY WHY DO THE FOOLS FLY SAID DENETHOR BETTER TO BURN SOONER THAN LATE FOR BURN WE MUST GO BACK TO YOUR BONFIRE AND I I WILL GO NOW TO MY PYRE TO MY PYRE NO TOMB FOR DENETHOR AND FARAMIR NO TOMB NO LONG SLOW SLEEP OF DEATH EMBALMED WE WILL BURN LIKE HEATHEN KINGS BEFORE EVER A SHIP SAILED HITHER FROM THE WEST THE WEST HAS FAILED GO BACK AND BURN
     THE MESSENGERS WITHOUT BOW OR ANSWER TURNED AND FLED
     NOW DENETHOR STOOD UP AND RELEASED THE FEVERED HAND OF FARAMIR THAT HE HAD HELD HE IS BURNING ALREADY BURNING HE SAID SADLY THE HOUSE OF HIS SPIRIT CRUMBLES THEN STEPPING SOFTLY TOWARDS PIPPIN HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM
     FAREWELL HE SAID FAREWELL PEREGRIN SON OF PALADIN YOUR SERVICE HAS BEEN SHORT AND NOW IT IS DRAWING TO AN END I RELEASE YOU FROM THE LITTLE THAT REMAINS GO NOW AND DIE IN WHAT WAY SEEMS BEST TO YOU AND WITH WHOM YOU WILL EVEN THAT FRIEND WHOSE FOLLY BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DEATH SEND FOR MY SERVANTS AND THEN GO FAREWELL
     I WILL NOT SAY FAREWELL MY LORD SAID PIPPIN KNEELING AND THEN SUDDENLY HOBBITLIKE ONCE MORE HE STOOD UP AND LOOKED THE OLD MAN IN THE EYES I WILL TAKE YOUR LEAVE SIR HE SAID FOR I WANT TO SEE GANDALF VERY MUCH INDEED BUT HE IS NO FOOL AND I WILL NOT THINK OF DYING UNTIL HE DESPAIRS OF LIFE BUT FROM MY WORD AND YOUR SERVICE I DO NOT WISH TO BE RELEASED WHILE YOU LIVE AND IF THEY COME AT LAST TO THE CITADEL I HOPE TO BE HERE AND STAND BESIDE YOU AND EARN PERHAPS THE ARMS THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
     DO AS YOU WILL MASTER HALFLING SAID DENETHOR BUT MY LIFE IS BROKEN SEND FOR MY SERVANTS HE TURNED BACK TO FARAMIR
     PIPPIN LEFT HIM AND CALLED FOR THE SERVANTS AND THEY CAME SIX MEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD STRONG AND FAIR YET THEY TREMBLED AT THE SUMMONS BUT IN A QUIET VOICE DENETHOR BADE THEM LAY WARM COVERLETS ON FARAMIRS BED AND TAKE IT UP AND THEY DID SO AND LIFTING UP THE BED THEY BORE IT FROM THE CHAMBER SLOWLY THEY PACED TO TROUBLE THE FEVERED MAN AS LITTLE AS MIGHT BE AND DENETHOR NOW BENDING ON A STAFF FOLLOWED THEM AND LAST CAME PIPPIN
     OUT FROM THE WHITE TOWER THEY WALKED AS IF TO A FUNERAL OUT INTO THE DARKNESS WHERE THE OVERHANGING CLOUD WAS LIT BENEATH WITH FLICKERS OF DULL RED SOFTLY THEY PACED THE GREAT COURTYARD AND AT A WORD FROM DENETHOR HALTED BESIDE THE WITHERED TREE
     ALL WAS SILENT SAVE FOR THE RUMOUR OF WAR IN THE CITY DOWN BELOW AND THEY HEARD THE WATER DRIPPING SADLY FROM THE DEAD BRANCHES INTO THE DARK POOL THEN THEY WENT ON THROUGH THE CITADEL GATE WHERE THE SENTINEL STARED AT THEM IN WONDER AND DISMAY AS THEY PASSED BY TURNING WESTWARD THEY CAME AT LENGTH TO A DOOR IN THE REARWARD WALL OF THE SIXTH CIRCLE FEN HOLLEN IT WAS CALLED FOR IT WAS KEPT EVER SHUT SAVE AT TIMES OF FUNERAL AND ONLY THE LORD OF THE CITY MIGHT USE THAT WAY OR THOSE WHO BORE THE TOKEN OF THE TOMBS AND TENDED THE HOUSES OF THE DEAD BEYOND IT WENT A WINDING ROAD THAT DESCENDED IN MANY CURVES DOWN TO THE NARROW LAND UNDER THE SHADOW OF MINDOLLUINS PRECIPICE WHERE STOOD THE MANSIONS OF THE DEAD KINGS AND OF THEIR STEWARDS
     A PORTER SAT IN A LITTLE HOUSE BESIDE THE WAY AND WITH FEAR IN HIS EYES HE CAME FORTH BEARING A LANTERN IN HIS HAND AT THE LORDS COMMAND HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND SILENTLY IT SWUNG BACK AND THEY PASSED THROUGH TAKING THE LANTERN FROM HIS HAND IT WAS DARK ON THE CLIMBING ROAD BETWEEN ANCIENT WALLS AND MANYPILLARED BALUSTERS LOOMING IN THE SWAYING LANTERNBEAM THEIR SLOW FEET ECHOED AS THEY WALKED DOWN DOWN UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE SILENT STREET RATH D
     THERE PIPPIN STARING UNEASILY ABOUT HIM SAW THAT HE WAS IN A WIDE VAULTED CHAMBER DRAPED AS IT WERE WITH THE GREAT SHADOWS THAT THE LITTLE LANTERN THREW UPON ITS SHROUDED WALLS AND DIMLY TO BE SEEN WERE MANY ROWS OF TABLES CARVED OF MARBLE AND UPON EACH TABLE LAY A SLEEPING FORM HANDS FOLDED HEAD PILLOWED UPON STONE BUT ONE TABLE NEAR AT HAND STOOD BROAD AND BARE UPON IT AT A SIGN FROM DENETHOR THEY LAID FARAMIR AND HIS FATHER SIDE BY SIDE AND COVERED THEM WITH ONE COVERING AND STOOD THEN WITH BOWED HEADS AS MOURNERS BESIDE A BED OF DEATH THEN DENETHOR SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE
     HERE WE WILL WAIT HE SAID BUT SEND NOT FOR THE EMBALMERS BRING US WOOD QUICK TO BURN AND LAY IT ALL ABOUT US AND BENEATH AND POUR OIL UPON IT AND WHEN I BID YOU THRUST IN A TORCH DO THIS AND SPEAK NO MORE TO ME FAREWELL
     BY YOUR LEAVE LORD SAID PIPPIN AND TURNED AND FLED IN TERROR FROM THE DEATHLY HOUSE POOR FARAMIR HE THOUGHT I MUST FIND GANDALF POOR FARAMIR QUITE LIKELY HE NEEDS MEDICINE MORE THAN TEARS OH WHERE CAN I FIND GANDALF IN THE THICK OF THINGS I SUPPOSE AND HE WILL HAVE NO TIME TO SPARE FOR DYING MEN OR MADMEN
     AT THE DOOR HE TURNED TO ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO HAD REMAINED ON GUARD THERE YOUR MASTER IS NOT HIMSELF HE SAID GO SLOW BRING NO FIRE TO THIS PLACE WHILE FARAMIR LIVES DO NOTHING UNTIL GANDALF COMES
     WHO IS THE MASTER OF MINAS TIRITH THE MAN ANSWERED THE LORD DENETHOR OR THE GREY WANDERER
     THE GREY WANDERER OR NO ONE IT WOULD SEEM SAID PIPPIN AND HE SPED BACK AND UP THE WINDING WAY AS SWIFTLY AS HIS FEET WOULD CARRY HIM PAST THE ASTONISHED PORTER OUT THROUGH THE DOOR AND ON TILL HE CAME NEAR THE GATE OF THE CITADEL THE SENTINEL HAILED HIM AS HE WENT BY AND HE RECOGNIZED THE VOICE OF BEREGOND
     WHITHER DO YOU RUN MASTER PEREGRIN HE CRIED
     TO FIND MITHRANDIR PIPPIN ANSWERED
     THE LORDS ERRANDS ARE URGENT AND SHOULD NOT BE HINDERED BY ME SAID BEREGOND BUT TELL ME QUICKLY IF YOU MAY WHAT GOES FORWARD WHITHER HAS MY LORD GONE I HAVE JUST COME ON DUTY BUT I HEARD THAT HE PASSED TOWARDS THE CLOSED DOOR AND MEN WERE BEARING FARAMIR BEFORE HIM
     YES SAID PIPPIN TO THE SILENT STREET
     BEREGOND BOWED HIS HEAD TO HIDE HIS TEARS THEY SAID THAT HE WAS DYING HE SIGHED AND NOW HE IS DEAD
     NO SAID PIPPIN NOT YET AND EVEN NOW HIS DEATH MIGHT BE PREVENTED I THINK BUT THE LORD OF THE CITY BEREGOND HAS FALLEN BEFORE HIS CITY IS TAKEN HE IS FEY AND DANGEROUS QUICKLY HE TOLD OF DENETHORS STRANGE WORDS AND DEEDS I MUST FIND GANDALF AT ONCE
     THEN YOU MUST GO DOWN TO THE BATTLE
     I KNOW THE LORD HAS GIVEN ME LEAVE BUT BEREGOND IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING TO STOP ANY DREADFUL THING HAPPENING
     THE LORD DOES NOT PERMIT THOSE WHO WEAR THE BLACK AND SILVER TO LEAVE THEIR POST FOR ANY CAUSE SAVE AT HIS OWN COMMAND
     WELL YOU MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN ORDERS AND THE LIFE OF FARAMIR SAID PIPPIN AND AS FOR ORDERS I THINK YOU HAVE A MADMAN TO DEAL WITH NOT A LORD I MUST RUN I WILL RETURN IF I CAN
     HE RAN ON DOWN DOWN TOWARDS THE OUTER CITY MEN FLYING BACK FROM THE BURNING PASSED HIM AND SOME SEEING HIS LIVERY TURNED AND SHOUTED BUT HE PAID NO HEED AT LAST HE WAS THROUGH THE SECOND GATE BEYOND WHICH GREAT FIRES LEAPED UP BETWEEN THE WALLS YET IT SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT NO NOISE OR SHOUTS OF BATTLE OR DIN OF ARMS COULD BE HEARD THEN SUDDENLY THERE WAS A DREADFUL CRY AND A GREAT SHOCK AND A DEEP ECHOING BOOM FORCING HIMSELF ON AGAINST A GUST OF FEAR AND HORROR THAT SHOOK HIM ALMOST TO HIS KNEES PIPPIN TURNED A CORNER OPENING ON THE WIDE PLACE BEHIND THE CITY GATE HE STOPPED DEAD HE HAD FOUND GANDALF BUT HE SHRANK BACK COWERING INTO A SHADOW
     EVER SINCE THE MIDDLE NIGHT THE GREAT ASSAULT HAD GONE ON THE DRUMS ROLLED TO THE NORTH AND TO THE SOUTH COMPANY UPON COMPANY OF THE ENEMY PRESSED TO THE WALLS THERE CAME GREAT BEASTS LIKE MOVING HOUSES IN THE RED AND FITFUL LIGHT THE MUMAKIL OF THE HARAD DRAGGING THROUGH THE LANES AMID THE FIRES HUGE TOWERS AND ENGINES YET THEIR CAPTAIN CARED NOT GREATLY WHAT THEY DID OR HOW MANY MIGHT BE SLAIN THEIR PURPOSE WAS ONLY TO TEST THE STRENGTH OF THE DEFENCE AND TO KEEP THE MEN OF GONDOR BUSY IN MANY PLACES IT WAS AGAINST THE GATE THAT HE WOULD THROW HIS HEAVIEST WEIGHT VERY STRONG IT MIGHT BE WROUGHT OF STEEL AND IRON AND GUARDED WITH TOWERS AND BASTIONS OF INDOMITABLE STONE YET IT WAS THE KEY THE WEAKEST POINT IN ALL THAT HIGH AND IMPENETRABLE WALL
     THE DRUMS ROLLED LOUDER FIRES LEAPED UP GREAT ENGINES CRAWLED ACROSS THE FIELD AND IN THE MIDST WAS A HUGE RAM GREAT AS A FORESTTREE A HUNDRED FEET IN LENGTH SWINGING ON MIGHTY CHAINS LONG HAD IT BEEN FORGING IN THE DARK SMITHIES OF MORDOR AND ITS HIDEOUS HEAD FOUNDED OF BLACK STEEL WAS SHAPED IN THE LIKENESS OF A RAVENING WOLF ON IT SPELLS OF RUIN LAY GROND THEY NAMED IT IN MEMORY OF THE HAMMER OF THE UNDERWORLD OF OLD GREAT BEASTS DREW IT ORCS SURROUNDED IT AND BEHIND WALKED MOUNTAINTROLLS TO WIELD IT
     BUT ABOUT THE GATE RESISTANCE STILL WAS STOUT AND THERE THE KNIGHTS OF DOL AMROTH AND THE HARDIEST OF THE GARRISON STOOD AT BAY SHOT AND DART FELL THICK SIEGETOWERS CRASHED OR BLAZED SUDDENLY LIKE TORCHES ALL BEFORE THE WALLS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GATE THE GROUND WAS CHOKED WITH WRECK AND WITH BODIES OF THE SLAIN YET STILL DRIVEN AS BY A MADNESS MORE AND MORE CAME UP
     GROND CRAWLED ON UPON ITS HOUSING NO FIRE WOULD CATCH AND THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN SOME GREAT BEAST THAT HAULED IT WOULD GO MAD AND SPREAD STAMPING RUIN AMONG THE ORCS INNUMERABLE THAT GUARDED IT THEIR BODIES WERE CAST ASIDE FROM ITS PATH AND OTHERS TOOK THEIR PLACE
     GROND CRAWLED ON THE DRUMS ROLLED WILDLY OVER THE HILLS OF SLAIN A HIDEOUS SHAPE APPEARED A HORSEMAN TALL HOODED CLOAKED IN BLACK SLOWLY TRAMPLING THE FALLEN HE RODE FORTH HEEDING NO LONGER ANY DART HE HALTED AND HELD UP A LONG PALE SWORD AND AS HE DID SO A GREAT FEAR FELL ON ALL DEFENDER AND FOE ALIKE AND THE HANDS OF MEN DROOPED TO THEIR SIDES AND NO BOW SANG FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS STILL
     THE DRUMS ROLLED AND RATTLED WITH A VAST RUSH GROND WAS HURLED FORWARD BY HUGE HANDS IT REACHED THE GATE IT SWUNG A DEEP BOOM RUMBLED THROUGH THE CITY LIKE THUNDER RUNNING IN THE CLOUDS BUT THE DOORS OF IRON AND POSTS OF STEEL WITHSTOOD THE STROKE
     THEN THE BLACK CAPTAIN ROSE IN HIS STIRRUPS AND CRIED ALOUD IN A DREADFUL VOICE SPEAKING IN SOME FORGOTTEN TONGUE WORDS OF POWER AND TERROR TO REND BOTH HEART AND STONE
     THRICE HE CRIED THRICE THE GREAT RAM BOOMED AND SUDDENLY UPON THE LAST STROKE THE GATE OF GONDOR BROKE AS IF STRICKEN BY SOME BLASTING SPELL IT BURST ASUNDER THERE WAS A FLASH OF SEARING LIGHTNING AND THE DOORS TUMBLED IN RIVEN FRAGMENTS TO THE GROUND
     IN RODE THE LORD OF THE NAZG
     ALL SAVE ONE THERE WAITING SILENT AND STILL IN THE SPACE BEFORE THE GATE SAT GANDALF UPON SHADOWFAX SHADOWFAX WHO ALONE AMONG THE FREE HORSES OF THE EARTH ENDURED THE TERROR UNMOVING STEADFAST AS A GRAVEN IMAGE IN RATH D
     YOU CANNOT ENTER HERE SAID GANDALF AND THE HUGE SHADOW HALTED GO BACK TO THE ABYSS PREPARED FOR YOU GO BACK FALL INTO THE NOTHINGNESS THAT AWAITS YOU AND YOUR MASTER GO
     THE BLACK RIDER FLUNG BACK HIS HOOD AND BEHOLD HE HAD A KINGLY CROWN AND YET UPON NO HEAD VISIBLE WAS IT SET THE RED FIRES SHONE BETWEEN IT AND THE MANTLED SHOULDERS VAST AND DARK FROM A MOUTH UNSEEN THERE CAME A DEADLY LAUGHTER
     OLD FOOL HE SAID OLD FOOL THIS IS MY HOUR DO YOU NOT KNOW DEATH WHEN YOU SEE IT DIE NOW AND CURSE IN VAIN AND WITH THAT HE LIFTED HIGH HIS SWORD AND FLAMES RAN DOWN THE BLADE
     GANDALF DID NOT MOVE AND IN THAT VERY MOMENT AWAY BEHIND IN SOME COURTYARD OF THE CITY A COCK CROWED SHRILL AND CLEAR HE CROWED RECKING NOTHING OF WIZARDRY OR WAR WELCOMING ONLY THE MORNING THAT IN THE SKY FAR ABOVE THE SHADOWS OF DEATH WAS COMING WITH THE DAWN
     AND AS IF IN ANSWER THERE CAME FROM FAR AWAY ANOTHER NOTE HORNS HORNS HORNS IN DARK MINDOLLUINS SIDES THEY DIMLY ECHOED GREAT HORNS OF THE NORTH WILDLY BLOWING ROHAN HAD COME AT LAST

     MERRY WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT SLIPPED AWAY TO GET READY FOR THE SUMMONS TO THE MARCH THIS WAS THE LAST STAGE BEFORE THE BATTLE IT DID NOT SEEM LIKELY TO HIM THAT MANY OF THEM WOULD SURVIVE IT BUT HE THOUGHT OF PIPPIN AND THE FLAMES IN MINAS TIRITH AND THRUST DOWN HIS OWN DREAD
     ALL WENT WELL THAT DAY AND NO SIGHT OR SOUND HAD THEY OF THE ENEMY WAITING TO WAYLAY THEM THE WILD MEN HAD PUT OUT A SCREEN OF WARY HUNTERS SO THAT NO ORC OR ROVING SPY SHOULD LEARN OF THE MOVEMENTS IN THE HILLS THE LIGHT WAS MORE DIM THAN EVER AS THEY DREW NEARER TO THE BELEAGUERED CITY AND THE RIDERS PASSED IN LONG FILES LIKE DARK SHADOWS OF MEN AND HORSES EACH COMPANY WAS GUIDED BY A WILD WOODMAN BUT OLD GHAN WALKED BESIDE THE KING THE START HAD BEEN SLOWER THAN WAS HOPED FOR IT HAD TAKEN TIME FOR THE RIDERS WALKING AND LEADING THEIR HORSES TO FIND PATHS OVER THE THICKLY WOODED RIDGES BEHIND THEIR CAMP AND DOWN INTO THE HIDDEN STONEWAIN VALLEY IT WAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE LEADERS CAME TO WIDE GREY THICKETS STRETCHING BEYOND THE EASTWARD SIDE OF AMON D BROKEN AND BURIED UNDER THE LEAVES OF UNCOUNTED YEARS BUT THE THICKETS OFFERED TO THE RIDERS THEIR LAST HOPE OF COVER BEFORE THEY WENT INTO OPEN BATTLE FOR BEYOND THEM LAY THE ROAD AND THE PLAINS OF ANDUIN WHILE EAST AND SOUTHWARDS THE SLOPES WERE BARE AND ROCKY AS THE WRITHEN HILLS GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND CLIMBED UP BASTION UPON BASTION INTO THE GREAT MASS AND SHOULDERS OF MINDOLLUIN
     THE LEADING COMPANY WAS HALTED AND AS THOSE BEHIND FILED UP OUT OF THE TROUGH OF THE STONEWAIN VALLEY THEY SPREAD OUT AND PASSED TO CAMPINGPLACES UNDER THE GREY TREES THE KING SUMMONED THE CAPTAINS TO COUNCIL 
     NO GOOD TO SEND HORSEMEN HE SAID WILD MEN HAVE ALREADY SEEN ALL THAT CAN BE SEEN IN THE BAD AIR THEY WILL COME SOON AND SPEAK TO ME HERE
     THE CAPTAINS CAME AND THEN OUT OF THE TREES CREPT WARILY OTHER PUKELSHAPES SO LIKE OLD GHAN THAT MERRY COULD HARDLY TELL THEM APART THEY SPOKE TO GHAN IN A STRANGE THROATY LANGUAGE
     PRESENTLY GHAN TURNED TO THE KING WILD MEN SAY MANY THINGS HE SAID FIRST BE WARY STILL MANY MEN IN CAMP BEYOND DGORGUN KNOCK THEM DOWN WITH EARTHTHUNDER AND WITH CLUBS OF BLACK IRON THEY ARE UNWARY AND DO NOT LOOK ABOUT THEM THEY THINK THEIR FRIENDS WATCH ALL ROADS AT THAT OLD GHAN MADE A CURIOUS GURGLING NOISE AND IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS LAUGHING

     GHANBURIGHAN SQUATTED DOWN AND TOUCHED THE EARTH WITH HIS HORNY BROW IN TOKEN OF FAREWELL THEN HE GOT UP AS IF TO DEPART BUT SUDDENLY HE STOOD LOOKING UP LIKE SOME STARTLED WOODLAND ANIMAL SNUFFLING A STRANGE AIR A LIGHT CAME IN HIS EYES
     WIND IS CHANGING HE CRIED AND WITH THAT IN A TWINKLING AS IT SEEMED HE AND HIS FELLOWS HAD VANISHED INTO THE GLOOMS NEVER TO BE SEEN BY ANY RIDER OF ROHAN AGAIN NOT LONG AFTER FAR AWAY EASTWARD THE FAINT DRUMS THROBBED AGAIN YET TO NO HEART IN ALL THE HOST CAME ANY FEAR THAT THE WILD MEN WERE UNFAITHFUL STRANGE AND UNLOVELY THOUGH THEY MIGHT APPEAR
     WE NEED NO FURTHER GUIDANCE SAID ELFHELM FOR THERE ARE RIDERS IN THE HOST WHO HAVE RIDDEN DOWN TO MUNDBURG IN DAYS OF PEACE I FOR ONE WHEN WE COME TO THE ROAD IT WILL VEER SOUTH AND THERE WILL LIE BEFORE US STILL SEVEN LEAGUES ERE WE REACH THE WALL OF THE TOWNLANDS ALONG MOST OF THAT WAY THERE IS MUCH GRASS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD ON THAT STRETCH THE ERRANDRIDERS OF GONDOR RECKONED TO MAKE THEIR GREATEST SPEED WE MAY RIDE IT SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT GREAT RUMOUR
     THEN SINCE WE MUST LOOK FOR FELL DEEDS AND THE NEED OF ALL OUR STRENGTH SAID 
     TO THIS THE KING ASSENTED AND THE CAPTAINS DEPARTED BUT SOON ELFHELM RETURNED THE SCOUTS HAVE FOUND NAUGHT TO REPORT BEYOND THE GREY WOOD LORD HE SAID SAVE TWO MEN ONLY TWO DEAD MEN AND TWO DEAD HORSES
     WELL SAID 
     THIS LORD THEY WERE ERRANDRIDERS OF GONDOR HIRGON WAS ONE MAYBE AT LEAST HIS HAND STILL CLASPED THE RED ARROW BUT HIS HEAD WAS HEWN OFF AND THIS ALSO IT WOULD SEEM BY THE SIGNS THAT THEY WERE FLEEING WESTWARD WHEN THEY FELL AS I READ IT THEY FOUND THE ENEMY ALREADY ON THE OUTWALL OR ASSAILING IT WHEN THEY RETURNED  AND THAT WOULD BE TWO NIGHTS AGO IF THEY USED FRESH HORSES FROM THE POSTS AS IS THEIR WONT THEY COULD NOT REACH THE CITY AND TURNED BACK
     ALAS SAID TH
     NEED BROOKS NO DELAY YET LATE IS BETTER THAN NEVER SAID 
     IT WAS NIGHT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD THE HOST OF ROHAN WAS MOVING SILENTLY NOW THE ROAD PASSING ABOUT THE SKIRTS OF MINDOLLUIN TURNED SOUTHWARD FAR AWAY AND ALMOST STRAIGHT AHEAD THERE WAS A RED GLOW UNDER THE BLACK SKY AND THE SIDES OF THE GREAT MOUNTAIN LOOMED DARK AGAINST IT THEY WERE DRAWING NEAR THE RAMMAS OF THE PELENNOR BUT THE DAY WAS NOT YET COME
     THE KING RODE IN THE MIDST OF THE LEADING COMPANY HIS HOUSEHOLDMEN ABOUT HIM ELFHELMS  CAME NEXT AND NOW MERRY NOTICED THAT DERNHELM HAD LEFT HIS PLACE AND IN THE DARKNESS WAS MOVING STEADILY FORWARD UNTIL AT LAST HE WAS RIDING JUST IN REAR OF THE KINGS GUARD THERE CAME A CHECK MERRY HEARD VOICES IN FRONT SPEAKING SOFTLY OUTRIDERS HAD COME BACK WHO HAD VENTURED FORWARD ALMOST TO THE WALL THEY CAME TO THE KING
     THERE ARE GREAT FIRES LORD SAID ONE THE CITY IS ALL SET ABOUT WITH FLAME AND THE FIELD IS FULL OF FOES BUT ALL SEEM DRAWN OFF TO THE ASSAULT AS WELL AS WE COULD GUESS THERE ARE FEW LEFT UPON THE OUTWALL AND THEY ARE HEEDLESS BUSY IN DESTRUCTION
     DO YOU REMEMBER THE WILD MANS WORDS LORD SAID ANOTHER I LIVE UPON THE OPEN WOLD IN DAYS OF PEACE WIDFARA IS MY NAME AND TO ME ALSO THE AIR BRINGS MESSAGES ALREADY THE WIND IS TURNING THERE COMES A BREATH OUT OF THE SOUTH THERE IS A SEATANG IN IT FAINT THOUGH IT BE THE MORNING WILL BRING NEW THINGS ABOVE THE REEK IT WILL BE DAWN WHEN YOU PASS THE WALL

     MEN CLASHED SPEAR UPON SHIELD
      SAID THNS WE CANNOT MAKE FOR WE KNOW NOT YET HOW THINGS STAND UPON THE FIELD FORTH NOW AND FEAR NO DARKNESS
     THE LEADING COMPANY RODE OFF AS SWIFTLY AS THEY COULD FOR IT WAS STILL DEEP DARK WHATEVER CHANGE WIDFARA MIGHT FOREBODE MERRY WAS RIDING BEHIND DERNHELM CLUTCHING WITH THE LEFT HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TRIED TO LOOSEN HIS SWORD IN ITS SHEATH HE FELT NOW BITTERLY THE TRUTH OF THE OLD KINGS WORDS IN SUCH A BATTLE WHAT WOULD YOU DO MERIADOC JUST THIS HE THOUGHT ENCUMBER A RIDER AND HOPE AT BEST TO STAY IN MY SEAT AND NOT BE POUNDED TO DEATH BY GALLOPING HOOFS
     IT WAS NO MORE THAN A LEAGUE TO WHERE THE OUTWALLS HAD STOOD THEY SOON REACHED THEM TOO SOON FOR MERRY WILD CRIES BROKE OUT AND THERE WAS SOME CLASH OF ARMS BUT IT WAS BRIEF THE ORCS BUSY ABOUT THE WALLS WERE FEW AND AMAZED AND THEY WERE QUICKLY SLAIN OR DRIVEN OFF BEFORE THE RUIN OF THE NORTHGATE IN THE RAMMAS THE KING HALTED AGAIN THE FIRST  DREW UP BEHIND HIM AND ABOUT HIM ON EITHER SIDE DERNHELM KEPT CLOSE TO THE KING THOUGH ELFHELMS COMPANY WAS AWAY ON THE RIGHT GRIMBOLDS MEN TURNED ASIDE AND PASSED ROUND TO A GREAT GAP IN THE WALL FURTHER EASTWARD
     MERRY PEERED FROM BEHIND DERNHELMS BACK FAR AWAY MAYBE TEN MILES OR MORE THERE WAS A GREAT BURNING BUT BETWEEN IT AND THE RIDERS LINES OF FIRE BLAZED IN A VAST CRESCENT AT THE NEAREST POINT LESS THAN A LEAGUE DISTANT HE COULD MAKE OUT LITTLE MORE ON THE DARK PLAIN AND AS YET HE NEITHER SAW ANY HOPE OF MORNING NOR FELT ANY WIND CHANGED OR UNCHANGED
     NOW SILENTLY THE HOST OF ROHAN MOVED FORWARD INTO THE FIELD OF GONDOR POURING IN SLOWLY BUT STEADILY LIKE THE RISING TIDE THROUGH BREACHES IN A DIKE THAT MEN HAVE THOUGHT SECURE BUT THE MIND AND WILL OF THE BLACK CAPTAIN WERE BENT WHOLLY ON THE FALLING CITY AND AS YET NO TIDINGS CAME TO HIM WARNING THAT HIS DESIGNS HELD ANY FLAW
     AFTER A WHILE THE KING LED HIS MEN AWAY SOMEWHAT EASTWARD TO COME BETWEEN THE FIRES OF THE SIEGE AND THE OUTER FIELDS STILL THEY WERE UNCHALLENGED AND STILL THEEMED TO SHRINK DOWN COWED BY AGE MERRY HIMSELF FELT AS IF A GREAT WEIGHT OF HORROR AND DOUBT HAD SETTLED ON HIM HIS HEART BEAT SLOWLY TIME SEEMED POISED IN UNCERTAINTY THEY WERE TOO LATE TOO LATE WAS WORSE THAN NEVER PERHAPS TH THE HILLS
     THEN SUDDENLY MERRY FELT IT AT LAST BEYOND DOUBT A CHANGE WIND WAS IN HIS FACE LIGHT WAS GLIMMERING FAR FAR AWAY IN THE SOUTH THE CLOUDS COULD BE DIMLY SEEN AS REMOTE GREY SHAPES ROLLING UP DRIFTING MORNING LAY BEYOND THEM
     BUT AT THAT SAME MOMENT THERE WAS A FLASH AS IF LIGHTNING HAD SPRUNG FROM THE EARTH BENEATH THE CITY FOR A SEARING SECOND IT STOOD DAZZLING FAR OFF IN BLACK AND WHITE ITS TOPMOST TOWER LIKE A GLITTERING NEEDLE AND THEN AS THE DARKNESS CLOSED AGAIN THERE CAME ROLLING OVER THE FIELDS A GREAT BOOM
     AT THAT SOUND THE BENT SHAPE OF THE KING SPRANG SUDDENLY ERECT TALL AND PROUD HE SEEMED AGAIN AND RISING IN HIS STIRRUPS HE CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE MORE CLEAR THAN ANY THERE HAD EVER HEARD A MORTAL MAN ACHIEVE BEFORE

     WITH THAT HE SEIZED A GREAT HORN FROM GUTHL
     
      
       RIDE NOW RIDE NOW RIDE TO GONDOR

      

     
     SUDDENLY THE KING CRIED TO SNOWMANE AND THE HORSE SPRANG AWAY BEHIND HIM HIS BANNER BLEW IN THE WIND WHITE HORSE UPON A FIELD OF GREEN BUT HE OUTPACED IT AFTER HIM THUNDERED THE KNIGHTS OF HIS HOUSE BUT HE WAS EVER BEFORE THEM  ROARED LIKE A BREAKER FOAMING TO THE SHORE BUT THAGE OF THE SUN AND THE GRASS FLAMED INTO GREEN ABOUT THE WHITE FEET OF HIS STEED FOR MORNING CAME MORNING AND A WIND FROM THE SEA AND THE DARKNESS WAS REMOVED AND THE HOSTS OF MORDOR WAILED AND TERROR TOOK THEM AND THEY FLED AND DIED AND THE HOOFS OF WRATH RODE OVER THEM AND THEN ALL THE HOST OF ROHAN BURST INTO SONG AND THEY SANG AS THEY SLEW FOR THE JOY OF BATTLE WAS ON THEM AND THE SOUND OF THEIR SINGING THAT WAS FAIR AND TERRIBLE CAME EVEN TO THE CITY
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 6
      THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS
     

     BUT IT WAS NO ORCCHIEFTAIN OR BRIGAND THAT LED THE ASSAULT UPON GONDOR THE DARKNESS WAS BREAKING TOO SOON BEFORE THE DATE THAT HIS MASTER HAD SET FOR IT FORTUNE HAD BETRAYED HIM FOR THE MOMENT AND THE WORLD HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM VICTORY WAS SLIPPING FROM HIS GRASP EVEN AS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO SEIZE IT BUT HIS ARM WAS LONG HE WAS STILL IN COMMAND WIELDING GREAT POWERS KING RINGWRAITH LORD OF THE NAZG

     THEN THCLOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHRONS LIKE A FIREBOLT IN A FOREST RIGHT THROUGH THE PRESS DROVE TH LEFT UNSLAIN OF THEIR CAVALRY TURNED AND FLED FAR AWAY
     BUT LO SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THE GLORY OF THE KING HIS GOLDEN SHIELD WAS DIMMED THE NEW MORNING WAS BLOTTED FROM THE SKY DARK FELL ABOUT HIM HORSES REARED AND SCREAMED MEN CAST FROM THE SADDLE LAY GROVELLING ON THE GROUND
     TO ME TO ME CRIED TH
     THE GREAT SHADOW DESCENDED LIKE A FALLING CLOUD AND BEHOLD IT WAS A WINGED CREATURE IF BIRD THEN GREATER THAN ALL OTHER BIRDS AND IT WAS NAKED AND NEITHER QUILL NOR FEATHER DID IT BEAR AND ITS VAST PINIONS WERE AS WEBS OF HIDE BETWEEN HORNED FINGERS AND IT STANK A CREATURE OF AN OLDER WORLD MAYBE IT WAS WHOSE KIND FINGERING IN FORGOTTEN MOUNTAINS COLD BENEATH THE MOON OUTSTAYED THEIR DAY AND IN HIDEOUS EYRIE BRED THIS LAST UNTIMELY BROOD APT TO EVIL AND THE DARK LORD TOOK IT AND NURSED IT WITH FELL MEATS UNTIL IT GREW BEYOND THE MEASURE OF ALL OTHER THINGS THAT FLY AND HE GAVE IT TO HIS SERVANT TO BE HIS STEED DOWN DOWN IT CAME AND THEN FOLDING ITS FINGERED WEBS IT GAVE A CROAKING CRY AND SETTLED UPON THE BODY OF SNOWMANE DIGGING IN ITS CLAWS STOOPING ITS LONG NAKED NECK
     UPON IT SAT A SHAPE BLACKMANTLED HUGE AND THREATENING A CROWN OF STEEL HE BORE BUT BETWEEN RIM AND ROBE NAUGHT WAS THERE TO SEE SAVE ONLY A DEADLY GLEAM OF EYES THE LORD OF THE NAZG
     BUT THHAD BEEN BORNE UNHARMED BEHIND HIM UNTIL THE SHADOW CAME AND THEN WINDFOLA HAD THROWN THEM IN HIS TERROR AND NOW RAN WILD UPON THE PLAIN MERRY CRAWLED ON ALL FOURS LIKE A DAZED BEAST AND SUCH A HORROR WAS ON HIM THAT HE WAS BLIND AND SICK
     KINGS MAN KINGS MAN HIS HEART CRIED WITHIN HIM YOU MUST STAY BY HIM AS A FATHER YOU SHALL BE TO ME YOU SAID BUT HIS WILL MADE NO ANSWER AND HIS BODY SHOOK HE DARED NOT OPEN HIS EYES OR LOOK UP
     THEN OUT OF THE BLACKNESS IN HIS MIND HE THOUGHT THAT HE HEARD DERNHELM SPEAKING YET NOW THE VOICE SEEMED STRANGE RECALLING SOME OTHER VOICE THAT HE HAD KNOWN
     BEGONE FOUL DWIMMERLAIK LORD OF CARRION LEAVE THE DEAD IN PEACE

     HINDER ME THOU FOOL NO LIVING MAN MAY HINDER ME
     THEN MERRY HEARD OF ALL SOUNDS IN THAT HOUR THE STRANGEST IT SEEMED THAT DERNHELM LAUGHED AND THE CLEAR VOICE WAS LIKE THE RING OF STEEL BUT NO LIVING MAN AM I YOU LOOK UPON A WOMAN 
     THE WINGED CREATURE SCREAMED AT HER BUT THE RINGWRAITH MADE NO ANSWER AND WAS SILENT AS IF IN SUDDEN DOUBT VERY AMAZEMENT FOR A MOMENT CONQUERED MERRYS FEAR HE OPENED HIS EYES AND THE BLACKNESS WAS LIFTED FROM THEM THERE SOME PACES FROM HIM SAT THE GREAT BEAST AND ALL SEEMED DARK ABOUT IT AND ABOVE IT LOOMED THE NAZGEARS WERE ON HER CHEEK A SWORD WAS IN HER HAND AND SHE RAISED HER SHIELD AGAINST THE HORROR OF HER ENEMYS EYES

     THE FACE OF THEIR ENEMY WAS NOT TURNED TOWARDS HIM BUT STILL HE HARDLY DARED TO MOVE DREADING LEST THE DEADLY EYES SHOULD FALL ON HIM SLOWLY SLOWLY HE BEGAN TO CRAWL ASIDE BUT THE BLACK CAPTAIN IN DOUBT AND MALICE INTENT UPON THE WOMAN BEFORE HIM HEEDED HIM NO MORE THAN A WORM IN THE MUD
     SUDDENLY THE GREAT BEAST BEAT ITS HIDEOUS WINGS AND THE WIND OF THEM WAS FOUL AGAIN IT LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND THEN SWIFTLY FELL DOWN UPON 
     STILL SHE DID NOT BLENCH MAIDEN OF THE ROHIRRIM CHILD OF KINGS SLENDER BUT AS A STEELBLADE FAIR BUT TERRIBLE A SWIFT STROKE SHE DEALT SKILLED AND DEADLY THE OUTSTRETCHED NECK SHE CLOVE ASUNDER AND THE HEWN HEAD FELL LIKE A STONE BACKWARD SHE SPRANG AS THE HUGE SHAPE CRASHED TO RUIN VAST WINGS OUTSPREAD CRUMPLED ON THE EARTH AND WITH ITS FALL THE SHADOW PASSED AWAY A LIGHT FELL ABOUT HER AND HER HAIR SHONE IN THE SUNRISE
     OUT OF THE WRECK ROSE THE BLACK RIDER TALL AND THREATENING TOWERING ABOVE HER WITH A CRY OF HATRED THAT STUNG THE VERY EARS LIKE VENOM HE LET FALL HIS MACE HER SHIELD WAS SHIVERED IN MANY PIECES AND HER ARM WAS BROKEN SHE STUMBLED TO HER KNEES HE BENT OVER HER LIKE A CLOUD AND HIS EYES GLITTERED HE RAISED HIS MACE TO KILL

     AND THERE STOOD MERIADOC THE HOBBIT IN THE MIDST OF THE SLAIN BLINKING LIKE AN OWL IN THE DAYLIGHT FOR TEARS BLINDED HIM AND THROUGH A MIST HE LOOKED ON 
     THEN MERRY STOOPED AND LIFTED HIS HAND TO KISS IT AND LO TH
     FAREWELL MASTER HOLBYTLA HE SAID MY BODY IS BROKEN I GO TO MY FATHERS AND EVEN IN THEIR MIGHTY COMPANY I SHALL NOT NOW BE ASHAMED I FELLED THE BLACK SERPENT A GRIM MORN AND A GLAD DAY AND A GOLDEN SUNSET

     NEW FORCES OF THE ENEMY WERE HASTENING UP THE ROAD FROM THE RIVER AND FROM UNDER THE WALLS CAME THE LEGIONS OF MORGUL AND FROM THE SOUTHWARD FIELDS CAME FOOTMEN OF HARAD WITH HORSEMEN BEFORE THEM AND BEHIND THEM ROSE THE HUGE BACKS OF THE MUMAKIL WITH WARTOWERS UPON THEM BUT NORTHWARD THE WHITE CREST OF 
     FOR A MOMENT THE THOUGHT FLITTED THROUGH MERRYS MIND WHERE IS GANDALF IS HE NOT HERE COULD HE NOT HAVE SAVED THE KING AND ND DISMAY FELL UPON HIM AS HE CAME TO THE KINGS SIDE AND STOOD THERE IN SILENCE
     THEN ONE OF THE KNIGHTS TOOK THE KINGS BANNER FROM THE HAND OF GUTHL

     THEN WITHOUT TAKING COUNSEL OR WAITING FOR THE APPROACH OF THE MEN OF THE CITY HE SPURRED HEADLONG BACK TO THE FRONT OF THE GREAT HOST AND BLEW A HORN AND CRIED ALOUD FOR THE ONSET OVER THE FIELD RANG HIS CLEAR VOICE CALLING DEATH RIDE RIDE TO RUIN AND THE WORLDS ENDING
     AND WITH THAT THE HOST BEGAN TO MOVE BUT THE ROHIRRIM SANG NO MORE DEATH THEY CRIED WITH ONE VOICE LOUD AND TERRIBLE AND GATHERING SPEED LIKE A GREAT TIDE THEIR BATTLE SWEPT ABOUT THEIR FALLEN KING AND PASSED ROARING AWAY SOUTHWARDS
     AND STILL MERIADOC THE HOBBIT STOOD THERE BLINKING THROUGH HIS TEARS AND NO ONE SPOKE TO HIM INDEED NONE SEEMED TO HEED HIM HE BRUSHED AWAY THE TEARS AND STOOPED TO PICK UP THE GREEN SHIELD THAT RE AND AS HE WATCHED IT IT WRITHED AND WITHERED AND WAS CONSUMED

     WHAT BURDEN DO YOU BEAR MEN OF ROHAN HE CRIED
     TH
     THEN THE PRINCE WENT FROM HIS HORSE AND KNELT BY THE BIER IN HONOUR OF THE KING AND HIS GREAT ONSET AND HE WEPT AND RISING HE LOOKED THEN ON 
     NAY ONE ONLY THEY ANSWERED THE LADY 
     THEN THE PRINCE SEEING HER BEAUTY THOUGH HER FACE WAS PALE AND COLD TOUCHED HER HAND AS HE BENT TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY ON HER MEN OF ROHAN HE CRIED ARE THERE NO LEECHES AMONG YOU SHE IS HURT TO THE DEATH MAYBE BUT I DEEM THAT SHE YET LIVES AND HE HELD THE BRIGHTBURNISHED VAMBRACE THAT WAS UPON HIS ARM BEFORE HER COLD TIPS AND BEHOLD A LITTLE MIST WAS LAID ON IT HARDLY TO BE SEEN
     HASTE NOW IS NEEDED HE SAID AND HE SENT ONE RIDING BACK SWIFTLY TO THE CITY TO BRING AID BUT HE BOWING LOW TO THE FALLEN BADE THEM FAREWELL AND MOUNTING RODE AWAY INTO BATTLE

      CHAPTER 7
      THE PYRE OF DENETHOR
     

     WHEN THE DARK SHADOW AT THE GATE WITHDREW GANDALF STILL SAT MOTIONLESS BUT PIPPIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AS IF A GREAT WEIGHT HAD BEEN LIFTED FROM HIM AND HE STOOD LISTENING TO THE HORNS AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THEY WOULD BREAK HIS HEART WITH JOY AND NEVER IN AFTER YEARS COULD HE HEAR A HORN BLOWN IN THE DISTANCE WITHOUT TEARS STARTING IN HIS EYES BUT NOW SUDDENLY HIS ERRAND RETURNED TO HIS MEMORY AND HE RAN FORWARD AT THAT MOMENT GANDALF STIRRED AND SPOKE TO SHADOWFAX AND WAS ABOUT TO RIDE THROUGH THE GATE
     GANDALF GANDALF CRIED PIPPIN AND SHADOWFAX HALTED
     WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SAID GANDALF IS IT NOT A LAW IN THE CITY THAT THOSE WHO WEAR THE BLACK AND SILVER MUST STAY IN THE CITADEL UNLESS THEIR LORD GIVES THEM LEAVE
     HE HAS SAID PIPPIN HE SENT ME AWAY BUT I AM FRIGHTENED SOMETHING TERRIBLE MAY HAPPEN UP THERE THE LORD IS OUT OF HIS MIND I THINK I AM AFRAID HE WILL KILL HIMSELF AND KILL FARAMIR TOO CANT YOU DO SOMETHING
     GANDALF LOOKED THROUGH THE GAPING GATE AND ALREADY ON THE FIELDS HE HEARD THE GATHERING SOUND OF BATTLE HE CLENCHED HIS HAND I MUST GO HE SAID THE BLACK RIDER IS ABROAD AND HE WILL YET BRING RUIN ON US I HAVE NO TIME
     BUT FARAMIR CRIED PIPPIN HE IS NOT DEAD AND THEY WILL BURN HIM ALIVE IF SOMEONE DOES NOT STOP THEM
     BURN HIM ALIVE SAID GANDALF WHAT IS THIS TALE BE QUICK
     DENETHOR HAS GONE TO THE TOMBS SAID PIPPIN AND HE HAS TAKEN FARAMIR AND HE SAYS WE ARE ALL TO BURN AND HE WILL NOT WAIT AND THEY ARE TO MAKE A PYRE AND BURN HIM ON IT AND FARAMIR AS WELL AND HE HAS SENT MEN TO FETCH WOOD AND OIL AND I HAVE TOLD BEREGOND BUT IM AFRAID HE WONT DARE TO LEAVE HIS POST HE IS ON GUARD AND WHAT CAN HE DO ANYWAY SO PIPPIN POURED OUT HIS TALE REACHING UP AND TOUCHING GANDALFS KNEE WITH TREMBLING HANDS CANT YOU SAVE FARAMIR
     MAYBE I CAN SAID GANDALF BUT IF I DO THEN OTHERS WILL DIE I FEAR WELL I MUST COME SINCE NO OTHER HELP CAN REACH HIM BUT EVIL AND SORROW WILL COME OF THIS EVEN IN THE HEART OF OUR STRONGHOLD THE ENEMY HAS POWER TO STRIKE US FOR HIS WILL IT IS THAT IS AT WORK
     THEN HAVING MADE UP HIS MIND HE ACTED SWIFTLY AND CATCHING UP PIPPIN AND SETTING HIM BEFORE HIM HE TURNED SHADOWFAX WITH A WORD UP THE CLIMBING STREETS OF MINAS TIRITH THEY CLATTERED WHILE THE NOISE OF WAR ROSE BEHIND THEM EVERYWHERE MEN WERE RISING FROM THEIR DESPAIR AND DREAD SEIZING THEIR WEAPONS CRYING ONE TO ANOTHER ROHAN HAS COME CAPTAINS WERE SHOUTING COMPANIES WERE MUSTERING MANY ALREADY WERE MARCHING DOWN TO THE GATE
     THEY MET THE PRINCE IMRAHIL AND HE CALLED TO THEM WHITHER NOW MITHRANDIR THE ROHIRRIM ARE FIGHTING ON THE FIELDS OF GONDOR WE MUST GATHER ALL THE STRENGTH THAT WE CAN FIND
     YOU WILL NEED EVERY MAN AND MORE SAID GANDALF MAKE ALL HASTE I WILL COME WHEN I CAN BUT I HAVE AN ERRAND TO THE LORD DENETHOR THAT WILL NOT WAIT TAKE COMMAND IN THE LORDS ABSENCE
     THEY PASSED ON AND AS THEY CLIMBED AND DREW NEAR TO THE CITADEL THEY FELT THE WIND BLOWING IN THEIR FACES AND THEY CAUGHT THE GLIMMER OF MORNING FAR AWAY A LIGHT GROWING IN THE SOUTHERN SKY BUT IT BROUGHT LITTLE HOPE TO THEM NOT KNOWING WHAT EVIL LAY BEFORE THEM FEARING TO COME TOO LATE
     DARKNESS IS PASSING SAID GANDALF BUT IT STILL LIES HEAVY ON THIS CITY
     AT THE GATE OF THE CITADEL THEY FOUND NO GUARD THEN BEREGOND HAS GONE SAID PIPPIN MORE HOPEFULLY THEY TURNED AWAY AND HASTENED ALONG THE ROAD TO THE CLOSED DOOR IT STOOD WIDE OPEN AND THE PORTER LAY BEFORE IT HE WAS SLAIN AND HIS KEY HAD BEEN TAKEN
     WORK OF THE ENEMY SAID GANDALF SUCH DEEDS HE LOVES FRIEND AT WAR WITH FRIEND LOYALTY DIVIDED IN CONFUSION OF HEARTS NOW HE DISMOUNTED AND BADE SHADOWFAX RETURN TO HIS STABLE FOR MY FRIEND HE SAID YOU AND I SHOULD HAVE RIDDEN TO THE FIELDS LONG AGO BUT OTHER MATTERS DELAY ME YET COME SWIFTLY IF I CALL
     THEY PASSED THE DOOR AND WALKED ON DOWN THE STEEP WINDING ROAD LIGHT WAS GROWING AND THE TALL COLUMNS AND CARVEN FIGURES BESIDE THE WAY WENT SLOWLY BY LIKE GREY GHOSTS
     SUDDENLY THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN AND THEY HEARD BELOW THEM CRIES AND THE RINGING OF SWORDS SUCH SOUNDS AS HAD NOT BEEN HEARD IN THE HALLOWED PLACES SINCE THE BUILDING OF THE CITY AT LAST THEY CAME TO RATH D
     STAY STAY CRIED GANDALF SPRINGING FORWARD TO THE STONE STAIR BEFORE THE DOOR STAY THIS MADNESS
     FOR THERE WERE THE SERVANTS OF DENETHOR WITH SWORDS AND TORCHES IN THEIR HANDS BUT ALONE IN THE PORCH UPON THE TOPMOST STEP STOOD BEREGOND CLAD IN THE BLACK AND SILVER OF THE GUARD AND HE HELD THE DOOR AGAINST THEM TWO OF THEM HAD ALREADY FALLEN TO HIS SWORD STAINING THE HALLOWS WITH THEIR BLOOD AND THE OTHERS CURSED HIM CALLING HIM OUTLAW AND TRAITOR TO HIS MASTER
     EVEN AS GANDALF AND PIPPIN RAN FORWARD THEY HEARD FROM WITHIN THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD THE VOICE OF DENETHOR CRYING HASTE HASTE DO AS I HAVE BIDDEN SLAY ME THIS RENEGADE OR MUST I DO SO MYSELF THEREUPON THE DOOR WHICH BEREGOND HELD SHUT WITH HIS LEFT HAND WAS WRENCHED OPEN AND THERE BEHIND HIM STOOD THE LORD OF THE CITY TALL AND FELL A LIGHT LIKE FLAME WAS IN HIS EYES AND HE HELD A DRAWN SWORD
     BUT GANDALF SPRANG UP THE STEPS AND THE MEN FELL BACK FROM HIM AND COVERED THEIR EYES FOR HIS COMING WAS LIKE THE INCOMING OF A WHITE LIGHT INTO A DARK PLACE AND HE CAME WITH GREAT ANGER HE LIFTED UP HIS HAND AND IN THE VERY STROKE THE SWORD OF DENETHOR FLEW UP AND LEFT HIS GRASP AND FELL BEHIND HIM IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSE AND DENETHOR STEPPED BACKWARD BEFORE GANDALF AS ONE AMAZED
     WHAT IS THIS MY LORD SAID THE WIZARD THE HOUSES OF THE DEAD ARE NO PLACES FOR THE LIVING AND WHY DO MEN FIGHT HERE IN THE HALLOWS WHEN THERE IS WAR ENOUGH BEFORE THE GATE OR HAS OUR ENEMY COME EVEN TO RATH D
     SINCE WHEN HAS THE LORD OF GONDOR BEEN ANSWERABLE TO THEE SAID DENETHOR OR MAY I NOT COMMAND MY OWN SERVANTS
     YOU MAY SAID GANDALF BUT OTHERS MAY CONTEST YOUR WILL WHEN IT IS TURNED TO MADNESS AND EVIL WHERE IS YOUR SON FARAMIR
     HE LIES WITHIN SAID DENETHOR BURNING ALREADY BURNING THEY HAVE SET A FIRE IN HIS FLESH BUT SOON ALL SHALL BE BURNED THE WEST HAS FAILED IT SHALL ALL GO UP IN A GREAT FIRE AND ALL SHALL BE ENDED ASH ASH AND SMOKE BLOWN AWAY ON THE WIND
     THEN GANDALF SEEING THE MADNESS THAT WAS ON HIM FEARED THAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE SOME EVIL DEED AND HE THRUST FORWARD WITH BEREGOND AND PIPPIN BEHIND HIM WHILE DENETHOR GAVE BACK UNTIL HE STOOD BESIDE THE TABLE WITHIN BUT THERE THEY FOUND FARAMIR STILL DREAMING IN HIS FEVER LYING UPON THE TABLE WOOD WAS PILED UNDER IT AND HIGH ALL ABOUT IT AND ALL WAS DRENCHED WITH OIL EVEN THE GARMENTS OF FARAMIR AND THE COVERLETS BUT AS YET NO FIRE HAD BEEN SET TO THE FUEL THEN GANDALF REVEALED THE STRENGTH THAT LAY HID IN HIM EVEN AS THE LIGHT OF HIS POWER WAS HIDDEN UNDER HIS GREY MANTLE HE LEAPED UP ON TO THE FAGGOTS AND RAISING THE SICK MAN LIGHTLY HE SPRANG DOWN AGAIN AND BORE HIM TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT AS HE DID SO FARAMIR MOANED AND CALLED ON HIS FATHER IN HIS DREAM
     DENETHOR STARTED AS ONE WAKING FROM A TRANCE AND THE FLAME DIED IN HIS EYES AND HE WEPT AND HE SAID DO NOT TAKE MY SON FROM ME HE CALLS FOR ME
     HE CALLS SAID GANDALF BUT YOU CANNOT COME TO HIM YET FOR HE MUST SEEK HEALING ON THE THRESHOLD OF DEATH AND MAYBE FIND IT NOT WHEREAS YOUR PART IS TO GO OUT TO THE BATTLE OF YOUR CITY WHERE MAYBE DEATH AWAITS YOU THIS YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART
     HE WILL NOT WAKE AGAIN SAID DENETHOR BATTLE IS VAIN WHY SHOULD WE WISH TO LIVE LONGER WHY SHOULD WE NOT GO TO DEATH SIDE BY SIDE
     AUTHORITY IS NOT GIVEN TO YOU STEWARD OF GONDOR TO ORDER THE HOUR OF YOUR DEATH ANSWERED GANDALF AND ONLY THE HEATHEN KINGS UNDER THE DOMINATION OF THE DARK POWER DID THUS SLAYING THEMSELVES IN PRIDE AND DESPAIR MURDERING THEIR KIN TO EASE THEIR OWN DEATH THEN PASSING THROUGH THE DOOR HE TOOK FARAMIR FROM THE DEADLY HOUSE AND LAID HIM ON THE BIER ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT AND WHICH HAD NOW BEEN SET IN THE PORCH DENETHOR FOLLOWED HIM AND STOOD TREMBLING LOOKING WITH LONGING ON THE FACE OF HIS SON AND FOR A MOMENT WHILE ALL WERE SILENT AND STILL WATCHING THE LORD IN HIS THROES HE WAVERED
     COME SAID GANDALF WE ARE NEEDED THERE IS MUCH THAT YOU CAN YET DO
     THEN SUDDENLY DENETHOR LAUGHED HE STOOD UP TALL AND PROUD AGAIN AND STEPPING SWIFTLY BACK TO THE TABLE HE LIFTED FROM IT THE PILLOW ON WHICH HIS HEAD HAD LAIN THEN COMING TO THE DOORWAY HE DREW ASIDE THE COVERING AND LO HE HAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS A PALANT AND AS HE HELD IT UP IT SEEMED TO THOSE THAT LOOKED ON THAT THE GLOBE BEGAN TO GLOW WITH AN INNER FLAME SO THAT THE LEAN FACE OF THE LORD WAS LIT AS WITH A RED FIRE AND IT SEEMED CUT OUT OF HARD STONE SHARP WITH BLACK SHADOWS NOBLE PROUD AND TERRIBLE HIS EYES GLITTERED
     PRIDE AND DESPAIR HE CRIED DIDST THOU THINK THAT THE EYES OF THE WHITE TOWER WERE BLIND NAY I HAVE SEEN MORE THAN THOU KNOWEST GREY FOOL FOR THY HOPE IS BUT IGNORANCE GO THEN AND LABOUR IN HEALING GO FORTH AND FIGHT VANITY FOR A LITTLE SPACE YOU MAY TRIUMPH ON THE FIELD FOR A DAY BUT AGAINST THE POWER THAT NOW ARISES THERE IS NO VICTORY TO THIS CITY ONLY THE FIRST FINGER OF ITS HAND HAS YET BEEN STRETCHED ALL THE EAST IS MOVING AND EVEN NOW THE WIND OF THY HOPE CHEATS THEE AND WAFTS UP ANDUIN A FLEET WITH BLACK SAILS THE WEST HAS FAILED IT IS TIME FOR ALL TO DEPART WHO WOULD NOT BE SLAVES
     SUCH COUNSELS WILL MAKE THE ENEMYS VICTORY CERTAIN INDEED SAID GANDALF
     HOPE ON THEN LAUGHED DENETHOR DO I NOT KNOW THEE MITHRANDIR THY HOPE IS TO RULE IN MY STEAD TO STAND BEHIND EVERY THRONE NORTH SOUTH OR WEST I HAVE READ THY MIND AND ITS POLICIES DO I NOT KNOW THAT YOU COMMANDED THIS HALFLING HERE TO KEEP SILENCE THAT YOU BROUGHT HIM HITHER TO BE A SPY WITHIN MY VERY CHAMBER AND YET IN OUR SPEECH TOGETHER I HAVE LEARNED THE NAMES AND PURPOSE OF ALL THY COMPANIONS SO WITH THE LEFT HAND THOU WOULDST USE ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE AS A SHIELD AGAINST MORDOR AND WITH THE RIGHT BRING UP THIS RANGER OF THE NORTH TO SUPPLANT ME
     BUT I SAY TO THEE GANDALF MITHRANDIR I WILL NOT BE THY TOOL I AM STEWARD OF THE HOUSE OF AN
     WHAT THEN WOULD YOU HAVE SAID GANDALF IF YOUR WILL COULD HAVE ITS WAY
     I WOULD HAVE THINGS AS THEY WERE IN ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE ANSWERED DENETHOR AND IN THE DAYS OF MY LONGFATHERS BEFORE ME TO BE THE LORD OF THIS CITY IN PEACE AND LEAVE MY CHAIR TO A SON AFTER ME WHO WOULD BE HIS OWN MASTER AND NO WIZARDS PUPIL BUT IF DOOM DENIES THIS TO ME THEN I WILL HAVE NAUGHT NEITHER LIFE DIMINISHED NOR LOVE HALVED NOR HONOUR ABATED
     TO ME IT WOULD NOT SEEM THAT A STEWARD WHO FAITHFULLY SURRENDERS HIS CHARGE IS DIMINISHED IN LOVE OR IN HONOUR SAID GANDALF AND AT THE LEAST YOU SHALL NOT ROB YOUR SON OF HIS CHOICE WHILE HIS DEATH IS STILL IN DOUBT
     AT THOSE WORDS DENETHORS EYES FLAMED AGAIN AND TAKING THE STONE UNDER HIS ARM HE DREW A KNIFE AND STRODE TOWARDS THE BIER BUT BEREGOND SPRANG FORWARD AND SET HIMSELF BEFORE FARAMIR
     SO CRIED DENETHOR THOU HADST ALREADY STOLEN HALF MY SONS LOVE NOW THOU STEALEST THE HEARTS OF MY KNIGHTS ALSO SO THAT THEY ROB ME WHOLLY OF MY SON AT THE LAST BUT IN THIS AT LEAST THOU SHALT NOT DEFY MY WILL TO RULE MY OWN END
     COME HITHER HE CRIED TO HIS SERVANTS COME IF YOU ARE NOT ALL RECREANT THEN TWO OF THEM RAN UP THE STEPS TO HIM SWIFTLY HE SNATCHED A TORCH FROM THE HAND OF ONE AND SPRANG BACK INTO THE HOUSE BEFORE GANDALF COULD HINDER HIM HE THRUST THE BRAND AMID THE FUEL AND AT ONCE IT CRACKLED AND ROARED INTO FLAME
     THEN DENETHOR LEAPED UPON THE TABLE AND STANDING THERE WREATHED IN FIRE AND SMOKE HE TOOK UP THE STAFF OF HIS STEWARDSHIP THAT LAY AT HIS FEET AND BROKE IT ON HIS KNEE CASTING THE PIECES INTO THE BLAZE HE BOWED AND LAID HIMSELF ON THE TABLE CLASPING THE PALANT WITH BOTH HANDS UPON HIS BREAST AND IT WAS SAID THAT EVER AFTER IF ANY MAN LOOKED IN THAT STONE UNLESS HE HAD A GREAT STRENGTH OF WILL TO TURN IT TO OTHER PURPOSE HE SAW ONLY TWO AGED HANDS WITHERING IN FLAME
     GANDALF IN GRIEF AND HORROR TURNED HIS FACE AWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR FOR A WHILE HE STOOD IN THOUGHT SILENT UPON THE THRESHOLD WHILE THOSE OUTSIDE HEARD THE GREEDY ROARING OF THE FIRE WITHIN AND THEN DENETHOR GAVE A GREAT CRY AND AFTERWARDS SPOKE NO MORE NOR WAS EVER AGAIN SEEN BY MORTAL MEN
     SO PASSES DENETHOR SON OF ECTHELION SAID GANDALF THEN HE TURNED TO BEREGOND AND THE LORDS SERVANTS THAT STOOD THERE AGHAST AND SO PASS ALSO THE DAYS OF GONDOR THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN FOR GOOD OR EVIL THEY ARE ENDED ILL DEEDS HAVE BEEN DONE HERE BUT LET NOW ALL ENMITY THAT LIES BETWEEN YOU BE PUT AWAY FOR IT WAS CONTRIVED BY THE ENEMY AND WORKS HIS WILL YOU HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN A NET OF WARRING DUTIES THAT YOU DID NOT WEAVE BUT THINK YOU SERVANTS OF THE LORD BLIND IN YOUR OBEDIENCE THAT BUT FOR THE TREASON OF BEREGOND FARAMIR CAPTAIN OF THE WHITE TOWER WOULD NOW ALSO BE BURNED
     BEAR AWAY FROM THIS UNHAPPY PLACE YOUR COMRADES WHO HAVE FALLEN AND WE WILL BEAR FARAMIR STEWARD OF GONDOR TO A PLACE WHERE HE CAN SLEEP IN PEACE OR DIE IF THAT BE HIS DOOM
     THEN GANDALF AND BEREGOND TAKING UP THE BIER BORE IT AWAY TOWARDS THE HOUSES OF HEALING WHILE BEHIND THEM WALKED PIPPIN WITH DOWNCAST HEAD BUT THE SERVANTS OF THE LORD STOOD GAZING AS STRICKEN MEN AT THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD AND EVEN AS GANDALF CAME TO THE END OF RATH D
     AT LENGTH THEY CAME BACK TO THE STEWARDS DOOR AND BEREGOND LOOKED WITH GRIEF AT THE PORTER THIS DEED I SHALL EVER RUE HE SAID BUT A MADNESS OF HASTE WAS ON ME AND HE WOULD NOT LISTEN BUT DREW SWORD AGAINST ME THEN TAKING THE KEY THAT HE HAD WRESTED FROM THE SLAIN MAN HE CLOSED THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT THIS SHOULD NOW BE GIVEN TO THE LORD FARAMIR HE SAID
     THE PRINCE OF DOL AMROTH IS IN COMMAND IN THE ABSENCE OF THE LORD SAID GANDALF BUT SINCE HE IS NOT HERE I MUST TAKE THIS ON MYSELF I BID YOU KEEP THE KEY AND GUARD IT UNTIL THE CITY IS SET IN ORDER AGAIN
     NOW AT LAST THEY PASSED INTO THE HIGH CIRCLES OF THE CITY AND IN THE LIGHT OF MORNING THEY WENT THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE HOUSES OF HEALING AND THESE WERE FAIR HOUSES SET APART FOR THE CARE OF THOSE WHO WERE GRIEVOUSLY SICK BUT NOW THEY WERE PREPARED FOR THE TENDING OF MEN HURT IN BATTLE OR DYING THEY STOOD NOT FAR FROM THE CITADELGATE IN THE SIXTH CIRCLE NIGH TO ITS SOUTHWARD WALL AND ABOUT THEM WAS A GARDEN AND A GREENSWARD WITH TREES THE ONLY SUCH PLACE IN THE CITY THERE DWELT THE FEW WOMEN THAT HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO REMAIN IN MINAS TIRITH SINCE THEY WERE SKILLED IN HEALING OR IN THE SERVICE OF THE HEALERS
     BUT EVEN AS GANDALF AND HIS COMPANIONS CAME CARRYING THE BIER TO THE MAIN DOOR OF THE HOUSES THEY HEARD A GREAT CRY THAT WENT UP FROM THE FIELD BEFORE THE GATE AND RISING SHRILL AND PIERCING INTO THE SKY PASSED AND DIED AWAY ON THE WIND SO TERRIBLE WAS THE CRY THAT FOR A MOMENT ALL STOOD STILL AND YET WHEN IT HAD PASSED SUDDENLY THEIR HEARTS WERE LIFTED UP IN SUCH A HOPE AS THEY HAD NOT KNOWN SINCE THE DARKNESS CAME OUT OF THE EAST AND IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THE LIGHT GREW CLEAR AND THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS
     BUT GANDALFS FACE WAS GRAVE AND SAD AND BIDDING BEREGOND AND PIPPIN TO TAKE FARAMIR INTO THE HOUSES OF HEALING HE WENT UP ON TO THE WALLS NEARBY AND THERE LIKE A FIGURE CARVEN IN WHITE HE STOOD IN THE NEW SUN AND LOOKED OUT AND HE BEHELD WITH THE SIGHT THAT WAS GIVEN TO HIM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN AND WHEN 
     THEY LOOKED AT HIM AND FOR A WHILE HE WAS SILENT AT LAST HE SPOKE MY FRIENDS HE SAID AND ALL YOU PEOPLE OF THIS CITY AND OF THE WESTERN LANDS THINGS OF GREAT SORROW AND RENOWN HAVE COME TO PASS SHALL WE WEEP OR BE GLAD BEYOND HOPE THE CAPTAIN OF OUR FOES HAS BEEN DESTROYED AND YOU HAVE HEARD THE ECHO OF HIS LAST DESPAIR BUT HE HAS NOT GONE WITHOUT WOE AND BITTER LOSS AND THAT I MIGHT HAVE AVERTED BUT FOR THE MADNESS OF DENETHOR SO LONG HAS THE REACH OF OUR ENEMY BECOME ALAS BUT NOW I PERCEIVE HOW HIS WILL WAS ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY
     THOUGH THE STEWARDS DEEMED THAT IT WAS A SECRET KEPT ONLY BY THEMSELVES LONG AGO I GUESSED THAT HERE IN THE WHITE TOWER ONE AT LEAST OF THE SEVEN SEEING STONES WAS PRESERVED IN THE DAYS OF HIS WISDOM DENETHOR DID NOT PRESUME TO USE IT NOR TO CHALLENGE SAURON KNOWING THE LIMITS OF HIS OWN STRENGTH BUT HIS WISDOM FAILED AND I FEAR THAT AS THE PERIL OF HIS REALM GREW HE LOOKED IN THE STONE AND WAS DECEIVED FAR TOO OFTEN I GUESS SINCE BOROMIR DEPARTED HE WAS TOO GREAT TO BE SUBDUED TO THE WILL OF THE DARK POWER HE SAW NONETHELESS ONLY THOSE THINGS WHICH THAT POWER PERMITTED HIM TO SEE THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE OBTAINED WAS DOUBTLESS OFTEN OF SERVICE TO HIM YET THE VISION OF THE GREAT MIGHT OF MORDOR THAT WAS SHOWN TO HIM FED THE DESPAIR OF HIS HEART UNTIL IT OVERTHREW HIS MIND
     NOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO ME SAID PIPPIN SHUDDERING AT HIS MEMORIES AS HE SPOKE THE LORD WENT AWAY FROM THE ROOM WHERE FARAMIR LAY AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE RETURNED THAT I FIRST THOUGHT HE WAS CHANGED OLD AND BROKEN
     IT WAS IN THE VERY HOUR THAT FARAMIR WAS BROUGHT TO THE TOWER THAT MANY OF US SAW A STRANGE LIGHT IN THE TOPMOST CHAMBER SAID BEREGOND BUT WE HAVE SEEN THAT LIGHT BEFORE AND IT HAS LONG BEEN RUMOURED IN THE CITY THAT THE LORD WOULD AT TIMES WRESTLE IN THOUGHT WITH HIS ENEMY
     ALAS THEN I HAVE GUESSED RIGHTLY SAID GANDALF THUS THE WILL OF SAURON ENTERED INTO MINAS TIRITH AND THUS I HAVE BEEN DELAYED HERE AND HERE I SHALL STILL BE FORCED TO REMAIN FOR I SHALL SOON HAVE OTHER CHARGES NOT FARAMIR ONLY
     NOW I MUST GO DOWN TO MEET THOSE WHO COME I HAVE SEEN A SIGHT UPON THE FIELD THAT IS VERY GRIEVOUS TO MY HEART AND GREATER SORROW MAY YET COME TO PASS COME WITH ME PIPPIN BUT YOU BEREGOND SHOULD RETURN TO THE CITADEL AND TELL THE CHIEF OF THE GUARD THERE WHAT HAS BEFALLEN IT WILL BE HIS DUTY I FEAR TO WITHDRAW YOU FROM THE GUARD BUT SAY TO HIM THAT IF I MAY GIVE HIM COUNSEL YOU SHOULD BE SENT TO THE HOUSES OF HEALING TO BE THE GUARD AND SERVANT OF YOUR CAPTAIN AND TO BE AT HIS SIDE WHEN HE AWAKES  IF THAT SHALL EVER BE AGAIN FOR BY YOU HE WAS SAVED FROM THE FIRE GO NOW I SHALL RETURN SOON
     WITH THAT HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT WITH PIPPIN DOWN TOWARDS THE LOWER CITY AND EVEN AS THEY HASTENED ON THEIR WAY THE WIND BROUGHT A GREY RAIN AND ALL THE FIRES SANK AND THERE AROSE A GREAT SMOKE BEFORE THEM
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 8
      THE HOUSES OF HEALING
     

     A MIST WAS IN MERRYS EYES OF TEARS AND WEARINESS WHEN THEY DREW NEAR THE RUINED GATE OF MINAS TIRITH HE GAVE LITTLE HEED TO THE WRECK AND SLAUGHTER THAT LAY ABOUT ALL FIRE AND SMOKE AND STENCH WAS IN THE AIR FOR MANY ENGINES HAD BEEN BURNED OR CAST INTO THE FIREPITS AND MANY OF THE SLAIN ALSO WHILE HERE AND THERE LAY MANY CARCASES OF THE GREAT SOUTHRON MONSTERS HALFBURNED OR BROKEN BY STONECAST OR SHOT THROUGH THE EYES BY THE VALIANT ARCHERS OF MORTHOND THE FLYING RAIN HAD CEASED FOR A TIME AND THE SUN GLEAMED UP ABOVE BUT ALL THE LOWER CITY WAS STILL WRAPPED IN A SMOULDERING REEK
     
     ALREADY MEN WERE LABOURING TO CLEAR A WAY THROUGH THE JETSAM OF BATTLE AND NOW OUT FROM THE GATE CAME SOME BEARING LITTERS GENTLY THEY LAID 
     SO THTO SOME DIM ENDING THAT MEMORY CANNOT SEIZE
     SLOWLY THE LIGHTS OF THE TORCHES IN FRONT OF HIM FLICKERED AND WENT OUT AND HE WAS WALKING IN A DARKNESS AND HE THOUGHT THIS IS A TUNNEL LEADING TO A TOMB THERE WE SHALL STAY FOREVER BUT SUDDENLY INTO HIS DREAM THERE FELL A LIVING VOICE
     WELL MERRY THANK GOODNESS I HAVE FOUND YOU
     HE LOOKED UP AND THE MIST BEFORE HIS EYES CLEARED A LITTLE THERE WAS PIPPIN THEY WERE FACE TO FACE IN A NARROW LANE AND BUT FOR THEMSELVES IT WAS EMPTY HE RUBBED HIS EYES
     WHERE IS THE KING HE SAID AND 
     THEY HAVE GONE UP INTO THE CITADEL SAID PIPPIN I THINK YOU MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP ON YOUR FEET AND TAKEN THE WRONG TURNING WHEN WE FOUND THAT YOU WERE NOT WITH THEM GANDALF SENT ME TO LOOK FOR YOU POOR OLD MERRY HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU AGAIN BUT YOU ARE WORN OUT AND I WONT BOTHER YOU WITH ANY TALK BUT TELL ME ARE YOU HURT OR WOUNDED
     NO SAID MERRY WELL NO I DONT THINK SO BUT I CANT USE MY RIGHT ARM PIPPIN NOT SINCE I STABBED HIM AND MY SWORD BURNED ALL AWAY LIKE A PIECE OF WOOD
     PIPPINS FACE WAS ANXIOUS WELL YOU HAD BETTER COME WITH ME AS QUICK AS YOU CAN HE SAID I WISH I COULD CARRY YOU YOU ARENT FIT TO WALK ANY FURTHER THEY SHOULDNT HAVE LET YOU WALK AT ALL BUT YOU MUST FORGIVE THEM SO MANY DREADFUL THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE CITY MERRY THAT ONE POOR HOBBIT COMING IN FROM THE BATTLE IS EASILY OVERLOOKED
     ITS NOT ALWAYS A MISFORTUNE BEING OVERLOOKED SAID MERRY I WAS OVERLOOKED JUST NOW BY  NO NO I CANT SPEAK OF IT HELP ME PIPPIN ITS ALL GOING DARK AGAIN AND MY ARM IS SO COLD
     LEAN ON ME MERRY LAD SAID PIPPIN COME NOW FOOT BY FOOT ITS NOT FAR
     ARE YOU GOING TO BURY ME SAID MERRY
     NO INDEED SAID PIPPIN TRYING TO SOUND CHEERFUL THOUGH HIS HEART WAS WRUNG WITH FEAR AND PITY NO WE ARE GOING TO THE HOUSES OF HEALING
     THEY TURNED OUT OF THE LANE THAT RAN BETWEEN TALL HOUSES AND THE OUTER WALL OF THE FOURTH CIRCLE AND THEY REGAINED THE MAIN STREET CLIMBING UP TO THE CITADEL STEP BY STEP THEY WENT WHILE MERRY SWAYED AND MURMURED AS ONE IN SLEEP
     ILL NEVER GET HIM THERE THOUGHT PIPPIN IS THERE NO ONE TO HELP ME I CANT LEAVE HIM HERE JUST THEN TO HIS SURPRISE A BOY CAME RUNNING UP BEHIND AND AS HE PASSED HE RECOGNIZED BERGIL BEREGONDS SON
     HULLO BERGIL HE CALLED WHERE ARE YOU GOING GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND STILL ALIVE
     I AM RUNNING ERRANDS FOR THE HEALERS SAID BERGIL I CANNOT STAY
     DONT SAID PIPPIN BUT TELL THEM UP THERE THAT I HAVE A SICK HOBBIT A PERIAN MIND YOU COME FROM THE BATTLEFIELD I DONT THINK HE CAN WALK SO FAR IF MITHRANDIR IS THERE HE WILL BE GLAD OF THE MESSAGE BERGIL RAN ON
     ID BETTER WAIT HERE THOUGHT PIPPIN SO HE LET MERRY SINK GENTLY DOWN ON TO THE PAVEMENT IN A PATCH OF SUNLIGHT AND THEN HE SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM LAYING MERRYS HEAD IN HIS LAP HE FELT HIS BODY AND LIMBS GENTLY AND TOOK HIS FRIENDS HANDS IN HIS OWN THE RIGHT HAND FELT ICY TO THE TOUCH
     IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE GANDALF HIMSELF CAME IN SEARCH OF THEM HE STOOPED OVER MERRY AND CARESSED HIS BROW THEN HE LIFTED HIM CAREFULLY HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BORNE IN HONOUR INTO THIS CITY HE SAID HE HAS WELL REPAID MY TRUST FOR IF ELROND HAD NOT YIELDED TO ME NEITHER OF YOU WOULD HAVE SET OUT AND THEN FAR MORE GRIEVOUS WOULD THE EVILS OF THIS DAY HAVE BEEN HE SIGHED AND YET HERE IS ANOTHER CHARGE ON MY HANDS WHILE ALL THE TIME THE BATTLE HANGS IN THE BALANCE
     SO AT LAST FARAMIR AND EA MORTAL MEN WERE SUBJECT TO SAVE OLD AGE ONLY FOR THAT THEY HAD FOUND NO CURE AND INDEED THE SPAN OF THEIR LIVES HAD NOW WANED TO LITTLE MORE THAN THAT OF OTHER MEN AND THOSE AMONG THEM WHO PASSED THE TALE OF FIVE SCORE YEARS WITH VIGOUR WERE GROWN FEW SAVE IN SOME HOUSES OF PURER BLOOD BUT NOW THEIR ART AND KNOWLEDGE WERE BAFFLED FOR THERE WERE MANY SICK OF A MALADY THAT WOULD NOT BE HEALED AND THEY CALLED IT THE BLACK SHADOW FOR IT CAME FROM THE NAZGDIED AND IT SEEMED TO THE TENDERS OF THE SICK THAT ON THE HALFLING AND ON THE LADY OF ROHAN THIS MALADY LAY HEAVILY STILL AT WHILES AS THE MORNING WORE AWAY THEY WOULD SPEAK MURMURING IN THEIR DREAMS AND THE WATCHERS LISTENED TO ALL THAT THEY SAID HOPING PERHAPS TO LEARN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP THEM TO UNDERSTAND THEIR HURTS BUT SOON THEY BEGAN TO FALL DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS AND AS THE SUN TURNED WEST A GREY SHADOW CREPT OVER THEIR FACES BUT FARAMIR BURNED WITH A FEVER THAT WOULD NOT ABATE
     GANDALF WENT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER FULL OF CARE AND HE WAS TOLD ALL THAT THE WATCHERS COULD HEAR AND SO THE DAY PASSED WHILE THE GREAT BATTLE OUTSIDE WENT ON WITH SHIFTING HOPES AND STRANGE TIDINGS AND STILL GANDALF WAITED AND WATCHED AND DID NOT GO FORTH TILL AT LAST THE RED SUNSET FILLED ALL THE SKY AND THE LIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOWS FELL ON THE GREY FACES OF THE SICK THEN IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO STOOD BY THAT IN THE GLOW THE FACES FLUSHED SOFTLY AS WITH HEALTH RETURNING BUT IT WAS ONLY A MOCKERY OF HOPE
     THEN AN OLD WIFE IORETH THE ELDEST OF THE WOMEN WHO SERVED IN THAT HOUSE LOOKING ON THE FAIR FACE OF FARAMIR WEPT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE LOVED HIM AND SHE SAID ALAS IF HE SHOULD DIE WOULD THAT THERE WERE KINGS IN GONDOR AS THERE WERE ONCE UPON A TIME THEY SAY FOR IT IS SAID IN OLD LORE THE HANDS OF THE KING ARE THE HANDS OF A HEALER AND SO THE RIGHTFUL KING COULD EVER BE KNOWN
     AND GANDALF WHO STOOD BY SAID MEN MAY LONG REMEMBER YOUR WORDS IORETH FOR THERE IS HOPE IN THEM MAYBE A KING HAS INDEED RETURNED TO GONDOR OR HAVE YOU NOT HEARD THE STRANGE TIDINGS THAT HAVE COME TO THE CITY
     I HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY WITH THIS AND THAT TO HEED ALL THE CRYING AND SHOUTING SHE ANSWERED ALL I HOPE IS THAT THOSE MURDERING DEVILS DO NOT COME TO THIS HOUSE AND TROUBLE THE SICK
     THEN GANDALF WENT OUT IN HASTE AND ALREADY THE FIRE IN THE SKY WAS BURNING OUT AND THE SMOULDERING HILLS WERE FADING WHILE ASHGREY EVENING CREPT OVER THE FIELDS
     NOW AS THE SUN WENT DOWN ARAGORN AND 
     BEHOLD THE SUN SETTING IN A GREAT FIRE IT IS A SIGN OF THE END AND FALL OF MANY THINGS AND A CHANGE IN THE TIDES OF THE WORLD BUT THIS CITY AND REALM HAS RESTED IN THE CHARGE OF THE STEWARDS FOR MANY LONG YEARS AND I FEAR THAT IF I ENTER IT UNBIDDEN THEN DOUBT AND DEBATE MAY ARISE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE WHILE THIS WAR IS FOUGHT I WILL NOT ENTER IN NOR MAKE ANY CLAIM UNTIL IT BE SEEN WHETHER WE OR MORDOR SHALL PREVAIL MEN SHALL PITCH MY TENTS UPON THE FIELD AND HERE I WILL AWAIT THE WELCOME OF THE LORD OF THE CITY
     BUT 
     NO SAID ARAGORN BUT I DEEM THE TIME UNRIPE AND I HAVE NO MIND FOR STRIFE EXCEPT WITH OUR ENEMY AND HIS SERVANTS
     AND THE PRINCE IMRAHIL SAID YOUR WORDS LORD ARE WISE IF ONE WHO IS A KINSMAN OF THE LORD DENETHOR MAY COUNSEL YOU IN THIS MATTER HE IS STRONGWILLED AND PROUD BUT OLD AND HIS MOOD HAS BEEN STRANGE SINCE HIS SON WAS STRICKEN DOWN YET I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU REMAIN LIKE A BEGGAR AT THE DOOR
     NOT A BEGGAR SAID ARAGORN SAY A CAPTAIN OF THE RANGERS WHO ARE UNUSED TO CITIES AND HOUSES OF STONE AND HE COMMANDED THAT HIS BANNER SHOULD BE FURLED AND HE DID OFF THE STAR OF THE NORTH KINGDOM AND GAVE IT TO THE KEEPING OF THE SONS OF ELROND
     THEN THE PRINCE IMRAHIL AND ABOUT IT AND TWELVE GUARDS KNIGHTS BOTH OF ROHAN AND GONDOR AND THE HANGINGS OF THE BED WERE OF GREEN AND WHITE BUT UPON THE KING WAS LAID THE GREAT CLOTH OF GOLD UP TO HIS BREAST AND UPON THAT HIS UNSHEATHED SWORD AND AT HIS FEET HIS SHIELD THE LIGHT OF THE TORCHES SHIMMERED IN HIS WHITE HAIR LIKE SUN IN THE SPRAY OF A FOUNTAIN BUT HIS FACE WAS FAIR AND YOUNG SAVE THAT A PEACE LAY ON IT BEYOND THE REACH OF YOUTH AND IT SEEMED THAT HE SLEPT
     WHEN THEY HAD STOOD SILENT FOR A TIME BESIDE THE KING IMRAHIL SAID WHERE IS THE STEWARD AND WHERE ALSO IS MITHRANDIR
     AND ONE OF THE GUARDS ANSWERED THE STEWARD OF GONDOR IS IN THE HOUSES OF HEALING
     BUT 
     AND IMRAHIL SAID BUT THE LADY 
     THEN HOPE UNLOOKEDFOR CAME SO SUDDENLY TO D THEY MET BEFORE THE DOORS OF THE HOUSES OF HEALING AND THEY GREETED GANDALF AND SAID WE SEEK THE STEWARD AND MEN SAY THAT HE IS IN THIS HOUSE HAS ANY HURT BEFALLEN HIM AND THE LADY 
     AND GANDALF ANSWERED SHE LIES WITHIN AND IS NOT DEAD BUT IS NEAR DEATH BUT THE LORD FARAMIR WAS WOUNDED BY AN EVIL DART AS YOU HAVE HEARD AND HE IS NOW THE STEWARD FOR DENETHOR HAS DEPARTED AND HIS HOUSE IS IN ASHES AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH GRIEF AND WONDER AT THE TALE THAT HE TOLD
     BUT IMRAHIL SAID SO VICTORY IS SHORN OF GLADNESS AND IT IS BITTER BOUGHT IF BOTH GONDOR AND ROHAN ARE IN ONE DAY BEREFT OF THEIR LORDS 
     AND THE CLOAKED MAN SPOKE AND SAID HE IS COME AND THEY SAW AS HE STEPPED INTO THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN BY THE DOOR THAT IT WAS ARAGORN WRAPPED IN THE GREY CLOAK OF LTHAT GANDALF SHOULD RULE US ALL IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOW AND IN OUR DEALINGS WITH THE ENEMY AND THEY AGREED UPON THAT
     THEN GANDALF SAID LET US NOT STAY AT THE DOOR FOR THE TIME IS URGENT LET US ENTER FOR IT IS ONLY IN THE COMING OF ARAGORN THAT ANY HOPE REMAINS FOR THE SICK THAT LIE IN THE HOUSE THUS SPAKE IORETH WISEWOMAN OF GONDOR THE HANDS OF THE KING ARE THE HANDS OF A HEALER AND SO SHALL THE RIGHTFUL KING BE KNOWN
     THEN ARAGORN ENTERED FIRST AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND THERE AT THE DOOR WERE TWO GUARDS IN THE LIVERY OF THE CITADEL ONE TALL BUT THE OTHER SCARCE THE HEIGHT OF A BOY AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE CRIED ALOUD IN SURPRISE AND JOY
     STRIDER HOW SPLENDID DO YOU KNOW I GUESSED IT WAS YOU IN THE BLACK SHIPS BUT THEY WERE ALL SHOUTING CORSAIRS AND WOULDNT LISTEN TO ME HOW DID YOU DO IT
     ARAGORN LAUGHED AND TOOK THE HOBBIT BY THE HAND WELL MET INDEED HE SAID BUT THERE IS NOT TIME YET FOR TRAVELLERS TALES
     BUT IMRAHIL SAID TO 
     AND ARAGORN HEARING HIM TURNED AND SAID VERILY FOR IN THE HIGH TONGUE OF OLD I AM ELESSAR THE ELFSTONE AND ENVINYATAR THE RENEWER AND HE LIFTED FROM HIS BREAST THE GREEN STONE THAT LAY THERE BUT STRIDER SHALL BE THE NAME OF MY HOUSE IF THAT BE EVER ESTABLISHED IN THE HIGH TONGUE IT WILL NOT SOUND SO ILL AND TELCONTAR I WILL BE AND ALL THE HEIRS OF MY BODY
     AND WITH THAT THEY PASSED INTO THE HOUSE AND AS THEY WENT TOWARDS THE ROOMS WHERE THE SICK WERE TENDED GANDALF TOLD OF THE DEEDS OF 
     ARAGORN WENT FIRST TO FARAMIR AND THEN TO THE LADY 
     AND 
     BUT ARAGORN ANSWERED NAY FOR THESE THREE AND MOST SOON FOR FARAMIR TIME IS RUNNING OUT ALL SPEED IS NEEDED
     THEN HE CALLED TO IORETH AND HE SAID YOU HAVE STORE IN THIS HOUSE OF THE HERBS OF HEALING
     YES LORD SHE ANSWERED BUT NOT ENOUGH I RECKON FOR ALL THAT WILL NEED THEM BUT I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHERE WE SHALL FIND MORE FOR ALL THINGS ARE AMISS IN THESE DREADFUL DAYS WHAT WITH FIRES AND BURNINGS AND THE LADS THAT RUN ERRANDS SO FEW AND ALL THE ROADS BLOCKED WHY IT IS DAYS OUT OF COUNT SINCE EVER A CARRIER CAME IN FROM LOSSARNACH TO THE MARKET BUT WE DO OUR BEST IN THIS HOUSE WITH WHAT WE HAVE AS I AM SURE YOUR LORDSHIP WILL KNOW
     I WILL JUDGE THAT WHEN I SEE SAID ARAGORN ONE THING ALSO IS SHORT TIME FOR SPEECH HAVE YOU ATHELAS
     I DO NOT KNOW I AM SURE LORD SHE ANSWERED AT LEAST NOT BY THAT NAME I WILL GO AND ASK OF THE HERBMASTER HE KNOWS ALL THE OLD NAMES
     IT IS ALSO CALLED KINGSFOIL SAID ARAGORN AND MAYBE YOU KNOW IT BY THAT NAME FOR SO THE COUNTRYFOLK CALL IT IN THESE LATTER DAYS
     OH THAT SAID IORETH WELL IF YOUR LORDSHIP HAD NAMED IT AT FIRST I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU NO WE HAVE NONE OF IT I AM SURE WHY I HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT IT HAD ANY GREAT VIRTUE AND INDEED I HAVE OFTEN SAID TO MY SISTERS WHEN WE CAME UPON IT GROWING IN THE WOODS KINGSFOIL I SAID  TIS A STRANGE NAME AND I WONDER WHY TIS CALLED SO FOR IF I WERE A KING I WOULD HAVE PLANTS MORE BRIGHT IN MY GARDEN STILL IT SMELLS SWEET WHEN BRUISED DOES IT NOT IF SWEET IS THE RIGHT WORD WHOLESOME MAYBE IS NEARER
     WHOLESOME VERILY SAID ARAGORN AND NOW DAME IF YOU LOVE THE LORD FARAMIR RUN AS QUICK AS YOUR TONGUE AND GET ME KINGSFOIL IF THERE IS A LEAF IN THE CITY
     AND IF NOT SAID GANDALF I WILL RIDE TO LOSSARNACH WITH IORETH BEHIND ME AND SHE SHALL TAKE ME TO THE WOODS BUT NOT TO HER SISTERS AND SHADOWFAX SHALL SHOW HER THE MEANING OF HASTE
     WHEN IORETH WAS GONE ARAGORN BADE THE OTHER WOMEN TO MAKE WATER HOT THEN HE TOOK FARAMIRS HAND IN HIS AND LAID THE OTHER HAND UPON THE SICK MANS BROW IT WAS DRENCHED WITH SWEAT BUT FARAMIR DID NOT MOVE OR MAKE ANY SIGN AND SEEMED HARDLY TO BREATHE
     HE IS NEARLY SPENT SAID ARAGORN TURNING TO GANDALF BUT THIS COMES NOT FROM THE WOUND SEE THAT IS HEALING HAD HE BEEN SMITTEN BY SOME DART OF THE NAZG
     I DREW IT FORTH SAID IMRAHIL AND STAUNCHED THE WOUND BUT I DID NOT KEEP THE ARROW FOR WE HAD MUCH TO DO IT WAS AS I REMEMBER JUST SUCH A DART AS THE SOUTHRONS USE YET I BELIEVED THAT IT CAME FROM THE SHADOWS ABOVE FOR ELSE HIS FEVER AND SICKNESS WERE NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD SINCE THE WOUND WAS NOT DEEP OR VITAL HOW THEN DO YOU READ THE MATTER
     WEARINESS GRIEF FOR HIS FATHERS MOOD A WOUND AND OVER ALL THE BLACK BREATH SAID ARAGORN HE IS A MAN OF STAUNCH WILL FOR ALREADY HE HAD COME CLOSE UNDER THE SHADOW BEFORE EVER HE RODE TO BATTLE ON THE OUTWALLS SLOWLY THE DARK MUST HAVE CREPT ON HIM EVEN AS HE FOUGHT AND STROVE TO HOLD HIS OUTPOST WOULD THAT I COULD HAVE BEEN HERE SOONER
     THEREUPON THE HERBMASTER ENTERED YOUR LORDSHIP ASKED FOR KINGSFOIL AS THE RUSTICS NAME IT HE SAID OR ATHELAS IN THE NOBLE TONGUE OR TO THOSE WHO KNOW SOMEWHAT OF THE VALINOREAN
     I DO SO SAID ARAGORN AND I CARE NOT WHETHER YOU SAY NOW ASEA ARANION OR KINGSFOIL SO LONG AS YOU HAVE SOME
     YOUR PARDON LORD SAID THE MAN I SEE YOU ARE A LOREMASTER NOT MERELY A CAPTAIN OF WAR BUT ALAS SIR WE DO NOT KEEP THIS THING IN THE HOUSES OF HEALING WHERE ONLY THE GRAVELY HURT OR SICK ARE TENDED FOR IT HAS NO VIRTUE THAT WE KNOW OF SAVE PERHAPS TO SWEETEN A FOULED AIR OR TO DRIVE AWAY SOME PASSING HEAVINESS UNLESS OF COURSE YOU GIVE HEED TO RHYMES OF OLD DAYS WHICH WOMEN SUCH AS OUR GOOD IORETH STILL REPEAT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
     
      
       WHEN THE BLACK BREATH BLOWS

       AND DEATHS SHADOW GROWS

       AND ALL LIGHTS PASS

       COME ATHELAS COME ATHELAS

       LIFE TO THE DYING

       IN THE KINGS HAND LYING

      

     
     IT IS BUT A DOGGREL I FEAR GARBLED IN THE MEMORY OF OLD WIVES ITS MEANING I LEAVE TO YOUR JUDGEMENT IF INDEED IT HAS ANY BUT OLD FOLK STILL USE AN INFUSION OF THE HERB FOR HEADACHES
     THEN IN THE NAME OF THE KING GO AND FIND SOME OLD MAN OF LESS LORE AND MORE WISDOM WHO KEEPS SOME IN HIS HOUSE CRIED GANDALF
     NOW ARAGORN KNELT BESIDE FARAMIR AND HELD A HAND UPON HIS BROW AND THOSE THAT WATCHED FELT THAT SOME GREAT STRUGGLE WAS GOING ON FOR ARAGORNS FACE GREW GREY WITH WEARINESS AND EVER AND ANON HE CALLED THE NAME OF FARAMIR BUT EACH TIME MORE FAINTLY TO THEIR HEARING AS IF ARAGORN HIMSELF WAS REMOVED FROM THEM AND WALKED AFAR IN SOME DARK VALE CALLING FOR ONE THAT WAS LOST
     AND AT LAST BERGIL CAME RUNNING IN AND HE BORE SIX LEAVES IN A CLOTH IT IS KINGSFOIL SIR HE SAID BUT NOT FRESH I FEAR IT MUST HAVE BEEN CULLED TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE LEAST I HOPE IT WILL SERVE SIR THEN LOOKING AT FARAMIR HE BURST INTO TEARS
     BUT ARAGORN SMILED IT WILL SERVE HE SAID THE WORST IS NOW OVER STAY AND BE COMFORTED THEN TAKING TWO LEAVES HE LAID THEM ON HIS HANDS AND BREATHED ON THEM AND THEN HE CRUSHED THEM AND STRAIGHTWAY A LIVING FRESHNESS FILLED THE ROOM AS IF THE AIR ITSELF AWOKE AND TINGLED SPARKLING WITH JOY AND THEN HE CAST THE LEAVES INTO THE BOWLS OF STEAMING WATER THAT WERE BROUGHT TO HIM AND AT ONCE ALL HEARTS WERE LIGHTENED FOR THE FRAGRANCE THAT CAME TO EACH WAS LIKE A MEMORY OF DEWY MORNINGS OF UNSHADOWED SUN IN SOME LAND OF WHICH THE FAIR WORLD IN SPRING IS ITSELF BUT A FLEETING MEMORY BUT ARAGORN STOOD UP AS ONE REFRESHED AND HIS EYES SMILED AS HE HELD A BOWL BEFORE FARAMIRS DREAMING FACE
     WELL NOW WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT SAID IORETH TO A WOMAN THAT STOOD BESIDE HER THE WEED IS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT REMINDS ME OF THE ROSES OF IMLOTH MELUI WHEN I WAS A LASS AND NO KING COULD ASK FOR BETTER
     SUDDENLY FARAMIR STIRRED AND HE OPENED HIS EYES AND HE LOOKED ON ARAGORN WHO BENT OVER HIM AND A LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE AND LOVE WAS KINDLED IN HIS EYES AND HE SPOKE SOFTLY MY LORD YOU CALLED ME I COME WHAT DOES THE KING COMMAND
     WALK NO MORE IN THE SHADOWS BUT AWAKE SAID ARAGORN YOU ARE WEARY REST A WHILE AND TAKE FOOD AND BE READY WHEN I RETURN
     I WILL LORD SAID FARAMIR FOR WHO WOULD LIE IDLE WHEN THE KING HAS RETURNED
     FAREWELL THEN FOR A WHILE SAID ARAGORN I MUST GO TO OTHERS WHO NEED ME AND HE LEFT THE CHAMBER WITH GANDALF AND IMRAHIL BUT BEREGOND AND HIS SON REMAINED BEHIND UNABLE TO CONTAIN THEIR JOY AS HE FOLLOWED GANDALF AND SHUT THE DOOR PIPPIN HEARD IORETH EXCLAIM
     KING DID YOU HEAR THAT WHAT DID I SAY THE HANDS OF A HEALER I SAID AND SOON THE WORD HAD GONE OUT FROM THE HOUSE THAT THE KING WAS INDEED COME AMONG THEM AND AFTER WAR HE BROUGHT HEALING AND THE NEWS RAN THROUGH THE CITY
     BUT ARAGORN CAME TO E ALTHOUGH IT IS UNBROKEN
     ALAS FOR SHE WAS PITTED AGAINST A FOE BEYOND THE STRENGTH OF HER MIND OR BODY AND THOSE WHO WILL TAKE A WEAPON TO SUCH AN ENEMY MUST BE STERNER THAN STEEL IF THE VERY SHOCK SHALL NOT DESTROY THEM IT WAS AN EVIL DOOM THAT SET HER IN HIS PATH FOR SHE IS A FAIR MAIDEN FAIREST LADY OF A HOUSE OF QUEENS AND YET I KNOW NOT HOW I SHOULD SPEAK OF HER WHEN I FIRST LOOKED ON HER AND PERCEIVED HER UNHAPPINESS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW A WHITE FLOWER STANDING STRAIGHT AND PROUD SHAPELY AS A LILY AND YET KNEW THAT IT WAS HARD AS IF WROUGHT BY ELFWRIGHTS OUT OF STEEL OR WAS IT MAYBE A FROST THAT HAD TURNED ITS SAP TO ICE AND SO IT STOOD BITTERSWEET STILL FAIR TO SEE BUT STRICKEN SOON TO FALL AND DIE HER MALADY BEGINS FAR BACK BEFORE THIS DAY DOES IT NOT 
     I MARVEL THAT YOU SHOULD ASK ME LORD HE ANSWERED FOR I HOLD YOU BLAMELESS IN THIS MATTER AS IN ALL ELSE YET I KNEW NOT THAT 
     MY FRIEND SAID GANDALF YOU HAD HORSES AND DEEDS OF ARMS AND THE FREE FIELDS BUT SHE BORN IN THE BODY OF A MAID HAD A SPIRIT AND COURAGE AT LEAST THE MATCH OF YOURS YET SHE WAS DOOMED TO WAIT UPON AN OLD MAN WHOM SHE LOVED AS A FATHER AND WATCH HIM FALLING INTO A MEAN DISHONOURED DOTAGE AND HER PART SEEMED TO HER MORE IGNOBLE THAN THAT OF THE STAFF HE LEANED ON
     THINK YOU THAT WORMTONGUE HAD POISON ONLY FOR THDOTARD WHAT IS THE HOUSE OF EORL BUT A THATCHED BARN WHERE BRIGANDS DRINK IN THE REEK AND THEIR BRATS ROLL ON THE FLOOR AMONG THEIR DOGS HAVE YOU NOT HEARD THOSE WORDS BEFORE SARUMAN SPOKE THEM THE TEACHER OF WORMTONGUE THOUGH I DO NOT DOUBT THAT WORMTONGUE AT HOME WRAPPED THEIR MEANING IN TERMS MORE CUNNING MY LORD IF YOUR SISTERS LOVE FOR YOU AND HER WILL STILL BENT TO HER DUTY HAD NOT RESTRAINED HER LIPS YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD EVEN SUCH THINGS AS THESE ESCAPE THEM BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE SPOKE TO THE DARKNESS ALONE IN THE BITTER WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WHEN ALL HER LIFE SEEMED SHRINKING AND THE WALLS OF HER BOWER CLOSING IN ABOUT HER A HUTCH TO TRAMMEL SOME WILD THING IN
     THEN IR AND BRAVE THAT CANNOT BE RETURNED SORROW AND PITY HAVE FOLLOWED ME EVER SINCE I LEFT HER DESPERATE IN DUNHARROW AND RODE TO THE PATHS OF THE DEAD AND NO FEAR UPON THAT WAY WAS SO PRESENT AS THE FEAR FOR WHAT MIGHT BEFALL HER AND YET FOR YOU SHE LOVES AND KNOWS BUT IN ME SHE LOVES ONLY A SHADOW AND A THOUGHT A HOPE OF GLORY AND GREAT DEEDS AND LANDS FAR FROM THE FIELDS OF ROHAN
     I HAVE MAYBE THE POWER TO HEAL HER BODY AND TO RECALL HER FROM THE DARK VALLEY BUT TO WHAT SHE WILL AWAKE HOPE OR FORGETFULNESS OR DESPAIR I DO NOT KNOW AND IF TO DESPAIR THEN SHE WILL DIE UNLESS OTHER HEALING COMES WHICH I CANNOT BRING ALAS FOR HER DEEDS HAVE SET HER AMONG THE QUEENS OF GREAT RENOWN
     THEN ARAGORN STOOPED AND LOOKED IN HER FACE AND IT WAS INDEED WHITE AS A LILY COLD AS FROST AND HARD AS GRAVEN STONE BUT HE BENT AND KISSED HER ON THE BROW AND CALLED HER SOFTLY SAYING
     
     SHE DID NOT STIR BUT NOW SHE BEGAN AGAIN TO BREATHE DEEPLY SO THAT HER BREAST ROSE AND FELL BENEATH THE WHITE LINEN OF THE SHEET ONCE MORE ARAGORN BRUISED TWO LEAVES OF ATHELAS AND CAST THEM INTO STEAMING WATER AND HE LAVED HER BROW WITH IT AND HER RIGHT ARM LYING COLD AND NERVELESS ON THE COVERLET
     THEN WHETHER ARAGORN HAD INDEED SOME FORGOTTEN POWER OF WESTERNESSE OR WHETHER IT WAS BUT HIS WORDS OF THE LADY RESH AND CLEAN AND YOUNG AS IF IT HAD NOT BEFORE BEEN BREATHED BY ANY LIVING THING AND CAME NEWMADE FROM SNOWY MOUNTAINS HIGH BENEATH A DOME OF STARS OR FROM SHORES OF SILVER FAR AWAY WASHED BY SEAS OF FOAM
     AWAKE 
     
     NOT LONG MY SISTER SAID 
      I AM STRANGELY WEARY SHE SAID I MUST REST A LITTLE BUT TELL ME WHAT OF THE LORD OF THE MARK ALAS DO NOT TELL ME THAT THAT WAS A DREAM FOR I KNOW THAT IT WAS NOT HE IS DEAD AS HE FORESAW
     HE IS DEAD SAID 
     THAT IS GRIEVOUS SHE SAID AND YET IT IS GOOD BEYOND ALL THAT I DARED HOPE IN THE DARK DAYS WHEN IT SEEMED THAT THE HOUSE OF EORL WAS SUNK IN HONOUR LESS THAN ANY SHEPHERDS COT AND WHAT OF THE KINGS ESQUIRE THE HALFLING 
     HE LIES NEARBY IN THIS HOUSE AND I WILL GO TO HIM SAID GANDALF 
     TO HEALTH SAID 
     GANDALF AND PIPPIN CAME TO MERRYS ROOM AND THERE THEY FOUND ARAGORN STANDING BY THE BED POOR OLD MERRY CRIED PIPPIN AND HE RAN TO THE BEDSIDE FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HIS FRIEND LOOKED WORSE AND A GREYNESS WAS IN HIS FACE AS IF A WEIGHT OF YEARS OF SORROW LAY ON HIM AND SUDDENLY A FEAR SEIZED PIPPIN THAT MERRY WOULD DIE
     DO NOT BE AFRAID SAID ARAGORN I CAME IN TIME AND I HAVE CALLED HIM BACK HE IS WEARY NOW AND GRIEVED AND HE HAS TAKEN A HURT LIKE THE LADY 
     THEN ARAGORN LAID HIS HAND ON MERRYS HEAD AND PASSING HIS HAND GENTLY THROUGH THE BROWN CURLS HE TOUCHED THE EYELIDS AND CALLED HIM BY NAME AND WHEN THE FRAGRANCE OF ATHELAS STOLE THROUGH THE ROOM LIKE THE SCENT OF ORCHARDS AND OF HEATHER IN THE SUNSHINE FULL OF BEES SUDDENLY MERRY AWOKE AND HE SAID
     I AM HUNGRY WHAT IS THE TIME
     PAST SUPPERTIME NOW SAID PIPPIN THOUGH I DARESAY I COULD BRING YOU SOMETHING IF THEY WILL LET ME
     THEY WILL INDEED SAID GANDALF AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT THIS RIDER OF ROHAN MAY DESIRE IF IT CAN BE FOUND IN MINAS TIRITH WHERE HIS NAME IS IN HONOUR
     GOOD SAID MERRY THEN I WOULD LIKE SUPPER FIRST AND AFTER THAT A PIPE AT THAT HIS FACE CLOUDED NO NOT A PIPE I DONT THINK ILL SMOKE AGAIN
     WHY NOT SAID PIPPIN
     WELL ANSWERED MERRY SLOWLY HE IS DEAD IT HAS BROUGHT IT ALL BACK TO ME HE SAID HE WAS SORRY HE HAD NEVER HAD A CHANCE OF TALKING HERBLORE WITH ME ALMOST THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID I SHANT EVER BE ABLE TO SMOKE AGAIN WITHOUT THINKING OF HIM AND THAT DAY PIPPIN WHEN HE RODE UP TO ISENGARD AND WAS SO POLITE
     SMOKE THEN AND THINK OF HIM SAID ARAGORN FOR HE WAS A GENTLE HEART AND A GREAT KING AND KEPT HIS OATHS AND HE ROSE OUT OF THE SHADOWS TO A LAST FAIR MORNING THOUGH YOUR SERVICE TO HIM WAS BRIEF IT SHOULD BE A MEMORY GLAD AND HONOURABLE TO THE END OF YOUR DAYS
     MERRY SMILED WELL THEN HE SAID IF STRIDER WILL PROVIDE WHAT IS NEEDED I WILL SMOKE AND THINK I HAD SOME OF SARUMANS BEST IN MY PACK BUT WHAT BECAME OF IT IN THE BATTLE I AM SURE I DONT KNOW
     MASTER MERIADOC SAID ARAGORN IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS AND THE REALM OF GONDOR WITH FIRE AND SWORD TO BRING HERBS TO A CARELESS SOLDIER WHO THROWS AWAY HIS GEAR YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF YOUR PACK HAS NOT BEEN FOUND THEN YOU MUST SEND FOR THE HERBMASTER OF THIS HOUSE AND HE WILL TELL YOU THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE HERB YOU DESIRE HAD ANY VIRTUES BUT THAT IT IS CALLED WESTMANSWEED BY THE VULGAR AND GALENAS BY THE NOBLE AND OTHER NAMES IN OTHER TONGUES MORE LEARNED AND AFTER ADDING A FEW HALFFORGOTTEN RHYMES THAT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HE WILL REGRETFULLY INFORM YOU THAT THERE IS NONE IN THE HOUSE AND HE WILL LEAVE YOU TO REFLECT ON THE HISTORY OF TONGUES AND SO NOW MUST I FOR I HAVE NOT SLEPT IN SUCH A BED AS THIS SINCE I RODE FROM DUNHARROW NOR EATEN SINCE THE DARK BEFORE DAWN
     MERRY SEIZED HIS HAND AND KISSED IT I AM FRIGHTFULLY SORRY HE SAID GO AT ONCE EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT AT BREE WE HAVE BEEN A NUISANCE TO YOU BUT IT IS THE WAY OF MY PEOPLE TO USE LIGHT WORDS AT SUCH TIMES AND SAY LESS THAN THEY MEAN WE FEAR TO SAY TOO MUCH IT ROBS US OF THE RIGHT WORDS WHEN A JEST IS OUT OF PLACE
     I KNOW THAT WELL OR I WOULD NOT DEAL WITH YOU IN THE SAME WAY SAID ARAGORN MAY THE SHIRE LIVE FOR EVER UNWITHERED AND KISSING MERRY HE WENT OUT AND GANDALF WENT WITH HIM
     PIPPIN REMAINED BEHIND WAS THERE EVER ANY ONE LIKE HIM HE SAID EXCEPT GANDALF OF COURSE I THINK THEY MUST BE RELATED MY DEAR ASS YOUR PACK IS LYING BY YOUR BED AND YOU HAD IT ON YOUR BACK WHEN I MET YOU HE SAW IT ALL THE TIME OF COURSE AND ANYWAY I HAVE SOME STUFF OF MY OWN COME ON NOW LONGBOTTOM LEAF IT IS FILL UP WHILE I RUN AND SEE ABOUT SOME FOOD AND THEN LETS BE EASY FOR A BIT DEAR ME WE TOOKS AND BRANDYBUCKS WE CANT LIVE LONG ON THE HEIGHTS
     NO SAID MERRY I CANT NOT YET AT ANY RATE BUT AT LEAST PIPPIN WE CAN NOW SEE THEM AND HONOUR THEM IT IS BEST TO LOVE FIRST WHAT YOU ARE FITTED TO LOVE I SUPPOSE YOU MUST START SOMEWHERE AND HAVE SOME ROOTS AND THE SOIL OF THE SHIRE IS DEEP STILL THERE ARE THINGS DEEPER AND HIGHER AND NOT A GAFFER COULD TEND HIS GARDEN IN WHAT HE CALLS PEACE BUT FOR THEM WHETHER HE KNOWS ABOUT THEM OR NOT I AM GLAD THAT I KNOW ABOUT THEM A LITTLE BUT I DONT KNOW WHY I AM TALKING LIKE THIS WHERE IS THAT LEAF AND GET MY PIPE OUT OF MY PACK IF IT ISNT BROKEN
     ARAGORN AND GANDALF WENT NOW TO THE WARDEN OF THE HOUSES OF HEALING AND THEY COUNSELLED HIM THAT FARAMIR AND 
     THE LADY 
     AS FOR FARAMIR SAID GANDALF HE MUST SOON LEARN THAT HIS FATHER IS DEAD BUT THE FULL TALE OF THE MADNESS OF DENETHOR SHOULD NOT BE TOLD TO HIM UNTIL HE IS QUITE HEALED AND HAS DUTIES TO DO SEE THAT BEREGOND AND THE PERIAN WHO WERE PRESENT DO NOT SPEAK TO HIM OF THESE THINGS YET
     AND THE OTHER PERIAN MERIADOC WHO IS UNDER MY CARE WHAT OF HIM SAID THE WARDEN
     IT IS LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE FIT TO ARISE TOMORROW FOR A SHORT WHILE SAID ARAGORN LET HIM DO SO IF HE WISHES HE MAY WALK A LITTLE IN THE CARE OF HIS FRIENDS
     THEY ARE A REMARKABLE RACE SAID THE WARDEN NODDING HIS HEAD VERY TOUGH IN THE FIBRE I DEEM
     AT THE DOORS OF THE HOUSES MANY WERE ALREADY GATHERED TO SEE ARAGORN AND THEY FOLLOWED AFTER HIM AND WHEN AT LAST HE HAD SUPPED MEN CAME AND PRAYED THAT HE WOULD HEAL THEIR KINSMEN OR THEIR FRIENDS WHOSE LIVES WERE IN PERIL THROUGH HURT OR WOUND OR WHO LAY UNDER THE BLACK SHADOW AND ARAGORN AROSE AND WENT OUT AND HE SENT FOR THE SONS OF ELROND AND TOGETHER THEY LABOURED FAR INTO THE NIGHT AND WORD WENT THROUGH THE CITY THE KING IS COME AGAIN INDEED AND THEY NAMED HIM ELFSTONE BECAUSE OF THE GREEN STONE THAT HE WORE AND SO THE NAME WHICH IT WAS FORETOLD AT HIS BIRTH THAT HE SHOULD BEAR WAS CHOSEN FOR HIM BY HIS OWN PEOPLE
     AND WHEN HE COULD LABOUR NO MORE HE CAST HIS CLOAK ABOUT HIM AND SLIPPED OUT OF THE CITY AND WENT TO HIS TENT JUST ERE DAWN AND SLEPT FOR A LITTLE AND IN THE MORNING THE BANNER OF DOL AMROTH A WHITE SHIP LIKE A SWAN UPON BLUE WATER FLOATED FROM THE TOWER AND MEN LOOKED UP AND WONDERED IF THE COMING OF THE KING HAD BEEN BUT A DREAM
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 9
      THE LAST DEBATE
     

     THE MORNING CAME AFTER THE DAY OF BATTLE AND IT WAS FAIR WITH LIGHT CLOUDS AND THE WIND TURNING WESTWARD LEGOLAS AND GIMLI WERE EARLY ABROAD AND THEY BEGGED LEAVE TO GO UP INTO THE CITY FOR THEY WERE EAGER TO SEE MERRY AND PIPPIN
     IT IS GOOD TO LEARN THAT THEY ARE STILL ALIVE SAID GIMLI FOR THEY COST US GREAT PAINS IN OUR MARCH OVER ROHAN AND I WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH PAINS ALL WASTED
     TOGETHER THE ELF AND THE DWARF ENTERED MINAS TIRITH AND FOLK THAT SAW THEM PASS MARVELLED TO SEE SUCH COMPANIONS FOR LEGOLAS WAS FAIR OF FACE BEYOND THE MEASURE OF MEN AND HE SANG AN ELVENSONG IN A CLEAR VOICE AS HE WALKED IN THE MORNING BUT GIMLI STALKED BESIDE HIM STROKING HIS BEARD AND STARING ABOUT HIM
     THERE IS SOME GOOD STONEWORK HERE HE SAID AS HE LOOKED AT THE WALLS BUT ALSO SOME THAT IS LESS GOOD AND THE STREETS COULD BE BETTER CONTRIVED WHEN ARAGORN COMES INTO HIS OWN I SHALL OFFER HIM THE SERVICE OF STONEWRIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAIN AND WE WILL MAKE THIS A TOWN TO BE PROUD OF
     THEY NEED MORE GARDENS SAID LEGOLAS THE HOUSES ARE DEAD AND THERE IS TOO LITTLE HERE THAT GROWS AND IS GLAD IF ARAGORN COMES INTO HIS OWN THE PEOPLE OF THE WOOD SHALL BRING HIM BIRDS THAT SING AND TREES THAT DO NOT DIE
     AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO THE PRINCE IMRAHIL AND LEGOLAS LOOKED AT HIM AND BOWED LOW FOR HE SAW THAT HERE INDEED WAS ONE WHO HAD ELVENBLOOD IN HIS VEINS HAIL LORD HE SAID IT IS LONG SINCE THE PEOPLE OF NIMRODEL LEFT THE WOODLANDS OF L
     SO IT IS SAID IN THE LORE OF MY LAND SAID THE PRINCE YET NEVER HAS ONE OF THE FAIR FOLK BEEN SEEN THERE FOR YEARS BEYOND COUNT AND I MARVEL TO SEE ONE HERE NOW IN THE MIDST OF SORROW AND WAR WHAT DO YOU SEEK
     I AM ONE OF THE NINE COMPANIONS WHO SET OUT WITH MITHRANDIR FROM IMLADRIS SAID LEGOLAS AND WITH THIS DWARF MY FRIEND I CAME WITH THE LORD ARAGORN BUT NOW WE WISH TO SEE OUR FRIENDS MERIADOC AND PEREGRIN WHO ARE IN YOUR KEEPING WE ARE TOLD
     YOU WILL FIND THEM IN THE HOUSES OF HEALING AND I WILL LEAD YOU THITHER SAID IMRAHIL
     IT WILL BE ENOUGH IF YOU SEND ONE TO GUIDE US LORD SAID LEGOLAS FOR ARAGORN SENDS THIS MESSAGE TO YOU HE DOES NOT WISH TO ENTER THE CITY AGAIN AT THIS TIME YET THERE IS NEED FOR THE CAPTAINS TO HOLD COUNCIL AT ONCE AND HE PRAYS THAT YOU AND 
     WE WILL COME SAID IMRAHIL AND THEY PARTED WITH COURTEOUS WORDS
     THAT IS A FAIR LORD AND A GREAT CAPTAIN OF MEN SAID LEGOLAS IF GONDOR HAS SUCH MEN STILL IN THESE DAYS OF FADING GREAT MUST HAVE BEEN ITS GLORY IN THE DAYS OF ITS RISING
     AND DOUBTLESS THE GOOD STONEWORK IS THE OLDER AND WAS WROUGHT IN THE FIRST BUILDING SAID GIMLI IT IS EVER SO WITH THE THINGS THAT MEN BEGIN THERE IS A FROST IN SPRING OR A BLIGHT IN SUMMER AND THEY FAIL OF THEIR PROMISE
     YET SELDOM DO THEY FAIL OF THEIR SEED SAID LEGOLAS AND THAT WILL LIE IN THE DUST AND ROT TO SPRING UP AGAIN IN TIMES AND PLACES UNLOOKEDFOR THE DEEDS OF MEN WILL OUTLAST US GIMLI
     AND YET COME TO NAUGHT IN THE END BUT MIGHTHAVEBEENS I GUESS SAID THE DWARF
     TO THAT THE ELVES KNOW NOT THE ANSWER SAID LEGOLAS
     WITH THAT THE SERVANT OF THE PRINCE CAME AND LED THEM TO THE HOUSES OF HEALING AND THERE THEY FOUND THEIR FRIENDS IN THE GARDEN AND THEIR MEETING WAS A MERRY ONE FOR A WHILE THEY WALKED AND TALKED REJOICING FOR A BRIEF SPACE IN PEACE AND REST UNDER THE MORNING HIGH UP IN THE WINDY CIRCLES OF THE CITY THEN WHEN MERRY BECAME WEARY THEY WENT AND SAT UPON THE WALL WITH THE GREENSWARD OF THE HOUSES OF HEALING BEHIND THEM AND AWAY SOUTHWARD BEFORE THEM WAS THE ANDUIN GLITTERING IN THE SUN AS IT FLOWED AWAY OUT OF THE SIGHT EVEN OF LEGOLAS INTO THE WIDE FLATS AND GREEN HAZE OF LEBENNIN AND SOUTH ITHILIEN
     AND NOW LEGOLAS FELL SILENT WHILE THE OTHERS TALKED AND HE LOOKED OUT AGAINST THE SUN AND AS HE GAZED HE SAW WHITE SEABIRDS BEATING UP THE RIVER
     LOOK HE CRIED GULLS THEY ARE FLYING FAR INLAND A WONDER THEY ARE TO ME AND A TROUBLE TO MY HEART NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE HAD I MET THEM UNTIL WE CAME TO PELARGIR AND THERE I HEARD THEM CRYING IN THE AIR AS WE RODE TO THE BATTLE OF THE SHIPS THEN I STOOD STILL FORGETTING WAR IN MIDDLEEARTH FOR THEIR WAILING VOICES SPOKE TO ME OF THE SEA THE SEA ALAS I HAVE NOT YET BEHELD IT BUT DEEP IN THE HEARTS OF ALL MY KINDRED LIES THE SEALONGING WHICH IT IS PERILOUS TO STIR ALAS FOR THE GULLS NO PEACE SHALL I HAVE AGAIN UNDER BEECH OR UNDER ELM
     SAY NOT SO SAID GIMLI THERE ARE COUNTLESS THINGS STILL TO SEE IN MIDDLEEARTH AND GREAT WORKS TO DO BUT IF ALL THE FAIR FOLK TAKE TO THE HAVENS IT WILL BE A DULLER WORLD FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOOMED TO STAY
     DULL AND DREARY INDEED SAID MERRY YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE HAVENS LEGOLAS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME FOLK BIG OR LITTLE AND EVEN A FEW WISE DWARVES LIKE GIMLI WHO NEED YOU AT LEAST I HOPE SO THOUGH I FEEL SOMEHOW THAT THE WORST OF THIS WAR IS STILL TO COME HOW I WISH IT WAS ALL OVER AND WELL OVER
     DONT BE SO GLOOMY CRIED PIPPIN THE SUN IS SHINING AND HERE WE ARE TOGETHER FOR A DAY OR TWO AT LEAST I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU ALL COME GIMLI YOU AND LEGOLAS HAVE MENTIONED YOUR STRANGE JOURNEY WITH STRIDER ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY THIS MORNING BUT YOU HAVENT TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT
     THE SUN MAY SHINE HERE SAID GIMLI BUT THERE ARE MEMORIES OF THAT ROAD THAT I DO NOT WISH TO RECALL OUT OF THE DARKNESS HAD I KNOWN WHAT WAS BEFORE ME I THINK THAT NOT FOR ANY FRIENDSHIP WOULD I HAVE TAKEN THE PATHS OF THE DEAD
     THE PATHS OF THE DEAD SAID PIPPIN I HEARD ARAGORN SAY THAT AND I WONDERED WHAT HE COULD MEAN WONT YOU TELL US SOME MORE
     NOT WILLINGLY SAID GIMLI FOR UPON THAT ROAD I WAS PUT TO SHAME GIMLI GL
     AND BY THE LOVE OF HIM ALSO SAID LEGOLAS FOR ALL THOSE WHO COME TO KNOW HIM COME TO LOVE HIM AFTER HIS OWN FASHION EVEN THE COLD MAIDEN OF THE ROHIRRIM IT WAS AT EARLY MORN OF THE DAY ERE YOU CAME THERE MERRY THAT WE LEFT DUNHARROW AND SUCH A FEAR WAS ON ALL THE FOLK THAT NONE WOULD LOOK ON OUR GOING SAVE THE LADY 
     ALAS I HAD HEART ONLY FOR MYSELF SAID GIMLI NAY I WILL NOT SPEAK OF THAT JOURNEY
     HE FELL SILENT BUT PIPPIN AND MERRY WERE SO EAGER FOR NEWS THAT AT LAST LEGOLAS SAID I WILL TELL YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR PEACE FOR I FELT NOT THE HORROR AND I FEARED NOT THE SHADOWS OF MEN POWERLESS AND FRAIL AS I DEEMED THEM
     SWIFTLY THEN HE TOLD OF THE HAUNTED ROAD UNDER THE MOUNTAINS AND THE DARK TRYST AT ERECH AND THE GREAT RIDE THENCE NINETY LEAGUES AND THREE TO PELARGIR ON ANDUIN FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS AND ON INTO A FIFTH WE RODE FROM THE BLACK STONE HE SAID AND LO IN THE DARKNESS OF MORDOR MY HOPE ROSE FOR IN THAT GLOOM THE SHADOW HOST SEEMED TO GROW STRONGER AND MORE TERRIBLE TO LOOK UPON SOME I SAW RIDING SOME STRIDING YET ALL MOVING WITH THE SAME GREAT SPEED SILENT THEY WERE BUT THERE WAS A GLEAM IN THEIR EYES IN THE UPLANDS OF LAMEDON THEY OVERTOOK OUR HORSES AND SWEPT ROUND US AND WOULD HAVE PASSED US BY IF ARAGORN HAD NOT FORBIDDEN THEM
     AT HIS COMMAND THEY FELL BACK EVEN THE SHADES OF MEN ARE OBEDIENT TO HIS WILL I THOUGHT THEY MAY SERVE HIS NEEDS YET 
     ONE DAY OF LIGHT WE RODE AND THEN CAME THE DAY WITHOUT DAWN AND STILL WE RODE ON AND CIRIL AND RINGLO WE CROSSED AND ON THE THIRD DAY WE CAME TO LINHIR ABOVE THE MOUTH OF GILRAIN AND THERE MEN OF LAMEDON CONTESTED THE FORDS WITH FELL FOLK OF UMBAR AND HARAD WHO HAD SAILED UP THE RIVER BUT DEFENDERS AND FOES ALIKE GAVE UP THE BATTLE AND FLED WHEN WE CAME CRYING OUT THAT THE KING OF THE DEAD WAS UPON THEM ONLY ANGBOR LORD OF LAMEDON HAD THE HEART TO ABIDE US AND ARAGORN BADE HIM GATHER HIS FOLK AND COME BEHIND IF THEY DARED WHEN THE GREY HOST HAD PASSED
     AT PELARGIR THE HEIR OF ISILDUR WILL HAVE NEED OF YOU HE SAID
     THUS WE CROSSED OVER GILRAIN DRIVING THE ALLIES OF MORDOR IN ROUT BEFORE US AND THEN WE RESTED A WHILE BUT SOON ARAGORN AROSE SAYING LO ALREADY MINAS TIRITH IS ASSAILED I FEAR THAT IT WILL FALL ERE WE COME TO ITS AID SO WE MOUNTED AGAIN BEFORE NIGHT HAD PASSED AND WENT ON WITH ALL THE SPEED THAT OUR HORSES COULD ENDURE OVER THE PLAINS OF LEBENNIN
     LEGOLAS PAUSED AND SIGHED AND TURNING HIS EYES SOUTHWARD SOFTLY HE SANG
     
      
       SILVER FLOW THE STREAMS FROM CELOS TO ERUI

       IN THE GREEN FIELDS OF LEBENNIN

       TALL GROWS THE GRASS THERE IN THE WIND FROM THE SEA

       THE WHITE LILIES SWAY

       AND THE GOLDEN BELLS ARE SHAKEN OF MALLOS AND ALFIRIN

       IN THE GREEN FIELDS OF LEBENNIN

       IN THE WIND FROM THE SEA

      

     
     GREEN ARE THOSE FIELDS IN THE SONGS OF MY PEOPLE BUT THEY WERE DARK THEN GREY WASTES IN THE BLACKNESS BEFORE US AND OVER THE WIDE LAND TRAMPLING UNHEEDED THE GRASS AND THE FLOWERS WE HUNTED OUR FOES THROUGH A DAY AND A NIGHT UNTIL WE CAME AT THE BITTER END TO THE GREAT RIVER AT LAST
     THEN I THOUGHT IN MY HEART THAT WE DREW NEAR TO THE SEA FOR WIDE WAS THE WATER IN THE DARKNESS AND SEABIRDS INNUMERABLE CRIED ON ITS SHORES ALAS FOR THE WAILING OF THE GULLS DID NOT THE LADY TELL ME TO BEWARE OF THEM AND NOW I CANNOT FORGET THEM
     FOR MY PART I HEEDED THEM NOT SAID GIMLI FOR WE CAME THEN AT LAST UPON BATTLE IN EARNEST THERE AT PELARGIR LAY THE MAIN FLEET OF UMBAR FIFTY GREAT SHIPS AND SMALLER VESSELS BEYOND COUNT MANY OF THOSE THAT WE PURSUED HAD REACHED THE HAVENS BEFORE US AND BROUGHT THEIR FEAR WITH THEM AND SOME OF THE SHIPS HAD PUT OFF SEEKING TO ESCAPE DOWN THE RIVER OR TO REACH THE FAR SHORE AND MANY OF THE SMALLER CRAFT WERE ABLAZE BUT THE HARADRIM BEING NOW DRIVEN TO THE BRINK TURNED AT BAY AND THEY WERE FIERCE IN DESPAIR AND THEY LAUGHED WHEN THEY LOOKED ON US FOR THEY WERE A GREAT ARMY STILL
     BUT ARAGORN HALTED AND CRIED WITH A GREAT VOICE NOW COME BY THE BLACK STONE I CALL YOU AND SUDDENLY THE SHADOW HOST THAT HAD HUNG BACK AT THE LAST CAME UP LIKE A GREY TIDE SWEEPING ALL AWAY BEFORE IT FAINT CRIES I HEARD AND DIM HORNS BLOWING AND A MURMUR AS OF COUNTLESS FAR VOICES IT WAS LIKE THE ECHO OF SOME FORGOTTEN BATTLE IN THE DARK YEARS LONG AGO PALE SWORDS WERE DRAWN BUT I KNOW NOT WHETHER THEIR BLADES WOULD STILL BITE FOR THE DEAD NEEDED NO LONGER ANY WEAPON BUT FEAR NONE WOULD WITHSTAND THEM
     TO EVERY SHIP THEY CAME THAT WAS DRAWN UP AND THEN THEY PASSED OVER THE WATER TO THOSE THAT WERE ANCHORED AND ALL THE MARINERS WERE FILLED WITH A MADNESS OF TERROR AND LEAPED OVERBOARD SAVE THE SLAVES CHAINED TO THE OARS RECKLESS WE RODE AMONG OUR FLEEING FOES DRIVING THEM LIKE LEAVES UNTIL WE CAME TO THE SHORE AND THEN TO EACH OF THE GREAT SHIPS THAT REMAINED ARAGORN SENT ONE OF THE DUNEDAIN AND THEY COMFORTED THE CAPTIVES THAT WERE ABOARD AND BADE THEM PUT ASIDE FEAR AND BE FREE
     ERE THAT DARK DAY ENDED NONE OF THE ENEMY WERE LEFT TO RESIST US ALL WERE DROWNED OR WERE FLYING SOUTH IN THE HOPE TO FIND THEIR OWN LANDS UPON FOOT STRANGE AND WONDERFUL I THOUGHT IT THAT THE DESIGNS OF MORDOR SHOULD BE OVERTHROWN BY SUCH WRAITHS OF FEAR AND DARKNESS WITH ITS OWN WEAPONS WAS IT WORSTED
     STRANGE INDEED SAID LEGOLAS IN THAT HOUR I LOOKED ON ARAGORN AND THOUGHT HOW GREAT AND TERRIBLE A LORD HE MIGHT HAVE BECOME IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS WILL HAD HE TAKEN THE RING TO HIMSELF NOT FOR NAUGHT DOES MORDOR FEAR HIM BUT NOBLER IS HIS SPIRIT THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF SAURON FOR IS HE NOT OF THE CHILDREN OF L
     BEYOND THE EYES OF THE DWARVES ARE SUCH FORETELLINGS SAID GIMLI BUT MIGHTY INDEED WAS ARAGORN THAT DAY LO ALL THE BLACK FLEET WAS IN HIS HANDS AND HE CHOSE THE GREATEST SHIP TO BE HIS OWN AND HE WENT UP INTO IT THEN HE LET SOUND A GREAT CONCOURSE OF TRUMPETS TAKEN FROM THE ENEMY AND THE SHADOW HOST WITHDREW TO THE SHORE THERE THEY STOOD SILENT HARDLY TO BE SEEN SAVE FOR A RED GLEAM IN THEIR EYES THAT CAUGHT THE GLARE OF THE SHIPS THAT WERE BURNING AND ARAGORN SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE TO THE DEAD MEN CRYING
     HEAR NOW THE WORDS OF THE HEIR OF ISILDUR YOUR OATH IS FULFILLED GO BACK AND TROUBLE NOT THE VALLEYS EVER AGAIN DEPART AND BE AT REST
     AND THEREUPON THE KING OF THE DEAD STOOD OUT BEFORE THE HOST AND BROKE HIS SPEAR AND CAST IT DOWN THEN HE BOWED LOW AND TURNED AWAY AND SWIFTLY THE WHOLE GREY HOST DREW OFF AND VANISHED LIKE A MIST THAT IS DRIVEN BACK BY A SUDDEN WIND AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I AWOKE FROM A DREAM
     THAT NIGHT WE RESTED WHILE OTHERS LABOURED FOR THERE WERE MANY CAPTIVES SET FREE AND MANY SLAVES RELEASED WHO HAD BEEN FOLK OF GONDOR TAKEN IN RAIDS AND SOON ALSO THERE WAS A GREAT GATHERING OF MEN OUT OF LEBENNIN AND THE ETHIR AND ANGBOR OF LAMEDON CAME UP WITH ALL THE HORSEMEN THAT HE COULD MUSTER NOW THAT THE FEAR OF THE DEAD WAS REMOVED THEY CAME TO AID US AND TO LOOK ON THE HEIR OF ISILDUR FOR THE RUMOUR OF THAT NAME HAD RUN LIKE FIRE IN THE DARK
     AND THAT IS NEAR THE END OF OUR TALE FOR DURING THAT EVENING AND NIGHT MANY SHIPS WERE MADE READY AND MANNED AND IN THE MORNING THE FLEET SET FORTH LONG PAST IT NOW SEEMS YET IT WAS BUT THE MORN OF THE DAY ERE YESTERDAY THE SIXTH SINCE WE RODE FROM DUNHARROW BUT STILL ARAGORN WAS DRIVEN BY FEAR THAT TIME WAS TOO SHORT
     IT IS FORTY LEAGUES AND TWO FROM PELARGIR TO THE LANDINGS AT THE HARLOND HE SAID YET TO THE HARLOND WE MUST COME TOMORROW OR FAIL UTTERLY
     THE OARS WERE NOW WIELDED BY FREE MEN AND MANFULLY THEY LABOURED YET SLOWLY WE PASSED UP THE GREAT RIVER FOR WE STROVE AGAINST ITS STREAM AND THOUGH THAT IS NOT SWIFT DOWN IN THE SOUTH WE HAD NO HELP OF WIND HEAVY WOULD MY HEART HAVE BEEN FOR ALL OUR VICTORY AT THE HAVENS IF LEGOLAS HAD NOT LAUGHED SUDDENLY
     UP WITH YOUR BEARD DURINS SON HE SAID FOR THUS IS IT SPOKEN OFT HOPE IS BORN WHEN ALL IS FORLORN BUT WHAT HOPE HE SAW FROM AFAR HE WOULD NOT TELL WHEN NIGHT CAME IT DID BUT DEEPEN THE DARKNESS AND OUR HEARTS WERE HOT FOR AWAY IN THE NORTH WE SAW A RED GLOW UNDER THE CLOUD AND ARAGORN SAID MINAS TIRITH IS BURNING
     BUT AT MIDNIGHT HOPE WAS INDEED BORN ANEW SEACRAFTY MEN OF THE ETHIR GAZING SOUTHWARD SPOKE OF A CHANGE COMING WITH A FRESH WIND FROM THE SEA LONG ERE DAY THE MASTED SHIPS HOISTED SAIL AND OUR SPEED GREW UNTIL DAWN WHITENED THE FOAM AT OUR PROWS AND SO IT WAS AS YOU KNOW THAT WE CAME IN THE THIRD HOUR OF THE MORNING WITH A FAIR WIND AND THE SUN UNVEILED AND WE UNFURLED THE GREAT STANDARD IN BATTLE IT WAS A GREAT DAY AND A GREAT HOUR WHATEVER MAY COME AFTER
     FOLLOW WHAT MAY GREAT DEEDS ARE NOT LESSENED IN WORTH SAID LEGOLAS GREAT DEED WAS THE RIDING OF THE PATHS OF THE DEAD AND GREAT IT SHALL REMAIN THOUGH NONE BE LEFT IN GONDOR TO SING OF IT IN THE DAYS THAT ARE TO COME
     AND THAT MAY WELL BEFALL SAID GIMLI FOR THE FACES OF ARAGORN AND GANDALF ARE GRAVE MUCH I WONDER WHAT COUNSELS THEY ARE TAKING IN THE TENTS THERE BELOW FOR MY PART LIKE MERRY I WISH THAT WITH OUR VICTORY THE WAR WAS NOW OVER YET WHATEVER IS STILL TO DO I HOPE TO HAVE A PART IN IT FOR THE HONOUR OF THE FOLK OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN
     AND I FOR THE FOLK OF THE GREAT WOOD SAID LEGOLAS AND FOR THE LOVE OF THE LORD OF THE WHITE TREE
     THEN THE COMPANIONS FELL SILENT BUT A WHILE THEY SAT THERE IN THE HIGH PLACE EACH BUSY WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS WHILE THE CAPTAINS DEBATED
     WHEN THE PRINCE IMRAHIL HAD PARTED FROM LEGOLAS AND GIMLI AT ONCE HE SENT FOR 
     MY LORDS SAID GANDALF LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THE STEWARD OF GONDOR BEFORE HE DIED YOU MAY TRIUMPH ON THE FIELDS OF THE PELENNOR FOR A DAY BUT AGAINST THE POWER THAT HAS NOW ARISEN THERE IS NO VICTORY I DO NOT BID YOU DESPAIR AS HE DID BUT TO PONDER THE TRUTH IN THESE WORDS
     THE STONES OF SEEING DO NOT LIE AND NOT EVEN THE LORD OF BARADDUR CAN MAKE THEM DO SO HE CAN MAYBE BY HIS WILL CHOOSE WHAT THINGS SHALL BE SEEN BY WEAKER MINDS OR CAUSE THEM TO MISTAKE THE MEANING OF WHAT THEY SEE NONETHELESS IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT WHEN DENETHOR SAW GREAT FORCES ARRAYED AGAINST HIM IN MORDOR AND MORE STILL BEING GATHERED HE SAW THAT WHICH TRULY IS
     HARDLY HAS OUR STRENGTH SUFFICED TO BEAT OFF THE FIRST GREAT ASSAULT THE NEXT WILL BE GREATER THIS WAR THEN IS WITHOUT FINAL HOPE AS DENETHOR PERCEIVED VICTORY CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY ARMS WHETHER YOU SIT HERE TO ENDURE SIEGE AFTER SIEGE OR MARCH OUT TO BE OVERWHELMED BEYOND THE RIVER YOU HAVE ONLY A CHOICE OF EVILS AND PRUDENCE WOULD COUNSEL YOU TO STRENGTHEN SUCH STRONG PLACES AS YOU HAVE AND THERE AWAIT THE ONSET FOR SO SHALL THE TIME BEFORE YOUR END BE MADE A LITTLE LONGER
     THEN YOU WOULD HAVE US RETREAT TO MINAS TIRITH OR DOL AMROTH OR TO DUNHARROW AND THERE SIT LIKE CHILDREN ON SANDCASTLES WHEN THE TIDE IS FLOWING SAID IMRAHIL
     THAT WOULD BE NO NEW COUNSEL SAID GANDALF HAVE YOU NOT DONE THIS AND LITTLE MORE IN ALL THE DAYS OF DENETHOR BUT NO I SAID THIS WOULD BE PRUDENT I DO NOT COUNSEL PRUDENCE I SAID VICTORY COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED BY ARMS I STILL HOPE FOR VICTORY BUT NOT BY ARMS FOR INTO THE MIDST OF ALL THESE POLICIES COMES THE RING OF POWER THE FOUNDATION OF BARADDUR AND THE HOPE OF SAURON
     CONCERNING THIS THING MY LORDS YOU NOW ALL KNOW ENOUGH FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PLIGHT AND OF SAURONS IF HE REGAINS IT YOUR VALOUR IS VAIN AND HIS VICTORY WILL BE SWIFT AND COMPLETE SO COMPLETE THAT NONE CAN FORESEE THE END OF IT WHILE THIS WORLD LASTS IF IT IS DESTROYED THEN HE WILL FALL AND HIS FALL WILL BE SO LOW THAT NONE CAN FORESEE HIS ARISING EVER AGAIN FOR HE WILL LOSE THE BEST PART OF THE STRENGTH THAT WAS NATIVE TO HIM IN HIS BEGINNING AND ALL THAT WAS MADE OR BEGUN WITH THAT POWER WILL CRUMBLE AND HE WILL BE MAIMED FOR EVER BECOMING A MERE SPIRIT OF MALICE THAT GNAWS ITSELF IN THE SHADOWS BUT CANNOT AGAIN GROW OR TAKE SHAPE AND SO A GREAT EVIL OF THIS WORLD WILL BE REMOVED
     OTHER EVILS THERE ARE THAT MAY COME FOR SAURON IS HIMSELF BUT A SERVANT OR EMISSARY YET IT IS NOT OUR PART TO MASTER ALL THE TIDES OF THE WORLD BUT TO DO WHAT IS IN US FOR THE SUCCOUR OF THOSE YEARS WHEREIN WE ARE SET UPROOTING THE EVIL IN THE FIELDS THAT WE KNOW SO THAT THOSE WHO LIVE AFTER MAY HAVE CLEAN EARTH TO TILL WHAT WEATHER THEY SHALL HAVE IS NOT OURS TO RULE
     NOW SAURON KNOWS ALL THIS AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS PRECIOUS THING WHICH HE LOST HAS BEEN FOUND AGAIN BUT HE DOES NOT YET KNOW WHERE IT IS OR SO WE HOPE AND THEREFORE HE IS NOW IN GREAT DOUBT FOR IF WE HAVE FOUND THIS THING THERE ARE SOME AMONG US WITH STRENGTH ENOUGH TO WIELD IT THAT TOO HE KNOWS FOR DO I NOT GUESS RIGHTLY ARAGORN THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN YOURSELF TO HIM IN THE STONE OF ORTHANC
     I DID SO ERE I RODE FROM THE HORNBURG ANSWERED ARAGORN I DEEMED THAT THE TIME WAS RIPE AND THAT THE STONE HAD COME TO ME FOR JUST SUCH A PURPOSE IT WAS THEN TEN DAYS SINCE THE RINGBEARER WENT EAST FROM RAUROS AND THE EYE OF SAURON I THOUGHT SHOULD BE DRAWN OUT FROM HIS OWN LAND TOO SELDOM HAS HE BEEN CHALLENGED SINCE HE RETURNED TO HIS TOWER THOUGH IF I HAD FORESEEN HOW SWIFT WOULD BE HIS ONSET IN ANSWER MAYBE I SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO SHOW MYSELF BARE TIME WAS GIVEN ME TO COME TO YOUR AID
     BUT HOW IS THIS ASKED 
     HE IS NOT YET SURE SAID GANDALF AND HE HAS NOT BUILT UP HIS POWER BY WAITING UNTIL HIS ENEMIES ARE SECURE AS WE HAVE DONE ALSO WE COULD NOT LEARN HOW TO WIELD THE FULL POWER ALL IN A DAY INDEED IT CAN BE USED ONLY BY ONE MASTER ALONE NOT BY MANY AND HE WILL LOOK FOR A TIME OF STRIFE ERE ONE OF THE GREAT AMONG US MAKES HIMSELF MASTER AND PUTS DOWN THE OTHERS IN THAT TIME THE RING MIGHT AID HIM IF HE WERE SUDDEN
     HE IS WATCHING HE SEES MUCH AND HEARS MUCH HIS NAZGOF HIS GREAT CAPTAIN
     HIS DOUBT WILL BE GROWING EVEN AS WE SPEAK HERE HIS EYE IS NOW STRAINING TOWARDS US BLIND ALMOST TO ALL ELSE THAT IS MOVING SO WE MUST KEEP IT THEREIN LIES ALL OUR HOPE THIS THEN IS MY COUNSEL WE HAVE NOT THE RING IN WISDOM OR GREAT FOLLY IT HAS BEEN SENT AWAY TO BE DESTROYED LEST IT DESTROY US WITHOUT IT WE CANNOT BY FORCE DEFEAT HIS FORCE BUT WE MUST AT ALL COSTS KEEP HIS EYE FROM HIS TRUE PERIL WE CANNOT ACHIEVE VICTORY BY ARMS BUT BY ARMS WE CAN GIVE THE RINGBEARER HIS ONLY CHANCE FRAIL THOUGH IT BE
     AS ARAGORN HAS BEGUN SO WE MUST GO ON WE MUST PUSH SAURON TO HIS LAST THROW WE MUST CALL OUT HIS HIDDEN STRENGTH SO THAT HE SHALL EMPTY HIS LAND WE MUST MARCH OUT TO MEET HIM AT ONCE WE MUST MAKE OURSELVES THE BAIT THOUGH HIS JAWS SHOULD CLOSE ON US HE WILL TAKE THAT BAIT IN HOPE AND IN GREED FOR HE WILL THINK THAT IN SUCH RASHNESS HE SEES THE PRIDE OF THE NEW RINGLORD AND HE WILL SAY SO HE PUSHES OUT HIS NECK TOO SOON AND TOO FAR LET HIM COME ON AND BEHOLD I WILL HAVE HIM IN A TRAP FROM WHICH HE CANNOT ESCAPE THERE I WILL CRUSH HIM AND WHAT HE HAS TAKEN IN HIS INSOLENCE SHALL BE MINE AGAIN FOR EVER
     WE MUST WALK OPENEYED INTO THAT TRAP WITH COURAGE BUT SMALL HOPE FOR OURSELVES FOR MY LORDS IT MAY WELL PROVE THAT WE OURSELVES SHALL PERISH UTTERLY IN A BLACK BATTLE FAR FROM THE LIVING LANDS SO THAT EVEN IF BARADDUR BE THROWN DOWN WE SHALL NOT LIVE TO SEE A NEW AGE BUT THIS I DEEM IS OUR DUTY AND BETTER SO THAN TO PERISH NONETHELESS  AS WE SURELY SHALL IF WE SIT HERE  AND KNOW AS WE DIE THAT NO NEW AGE SHALL BE
     THEY WERE SILENT FOR A WHILE AT LENGTH ARAGORN SPOKE AS I HAVE BEGUN SO I WILL GO ON WE COME NOW TO THE VERY BRINK WHERE HOPE AND DESPAIR ARE AKIN TO WAVER IS TO FALL LET NONE NOW REJECT THE COUNSELS OF GANDALF WHOSE LONG LABOURS AGAINST SAURON COME AT LAST TO THEIR TEST BUT FOR HIM ALL WOULD LONG AGO HAVE BEEN LOST NONETHELESS I DO NOT YET CLAIM TO COMMAND ANY MAN LET OTHERS CHOOSE AS THEY WILL
     THEN SAID ELROHIR FROM THE NORTH WE CAME WITH THIS PURPOSE AND FROM ELROND OUR FATHER WE BROUGHT THIS VERY COUNSEL WE WILL NOT TURN BACK
     AS FOR MYSELF SAID 
     AS FOR ME SAID IMRAHIL THE LORD ARAGORN I HOLD TO BE MY LIEGELORD WHETHER HE CLAIM IT OR NO HIS WISH IS TO ME A COMMAND I WILL GO ALSO YET FOR A WHILE I STAND IN THE PLACE OF THE STEWARD OF GONDOR AND IT IS MINE TO THINK FIRST OF ITS PEOPLE TO PRUDENCE SOME HEED MUST STILL BE GIVEN FOR WE MUST PREPARE AGAINST ALL CHANCES GOOD AS WELL AS EVIL NOW IT MAY BE THAT WE SHALL TRIUMPH AND WHILE THERE IS ANY HOPE OF THIS GONDOR MUST BE PROTECTED I WOULD NOT HAVE US RETURN WITH VICTORY TO A CITY IN RUINS AND A LAND RAVAGED BEHIND US AND YET WE LEARN FROM THE ROHIRRIM THAT THERE IS AN ARMY STILL UNFOUGHT UPON OUR NORTHERN FLANK
     THAT IS TRUE SAID GANDALF I DO NOT COUNSEL YOU TO LEAVE THE CITY ALL UNMANNED INDEED THE FORCE THAT WE LEAD EAST NEED NOT BE GREAT ENOUGH FOR ANY ASSAULT IN EARNEST UPON MORDOR SO LONG AS IT BE GREAT ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE BATTLE AND IT MUST MOVE SOON THEREFORE I ASK THE CAPTAINS WHAT FORCE COULD WE MUSTER AND LEAD OUT IN TWO DAYS TIME AT THE LATEST AND THEY MUST BE HARDY MEN THAT GO WILLINGLY KNOWING THEIR PERIL
     ALL ARE WEARY AND VERY MANY HAVE WOUNDS LIGHT OR GRIEVOUS SAID 
     WE HAVE NOT ONLY TO RECKON WITH THOSE WHO FOUGHT ON THIS FIELD SAID ARAGORN NEW STRENGTH IS ON THE WAY FROM THE SOUTHERN FIEFS NOW THAT THE COASTS HAVE BEEN RID FOUR THOUSANDS I SENT MARCHING FROM PELARGIR THROUGH LOSSARNACH TWO DAYS AGO AND ANGBOR THE FEARLESS RIDES BEFORE THEM IF WE SET OUT IN TWO DAYS MORE THEY WILL DRAW NIGH ERE WE DEPART MOREOVER MANY WERE BIDDEN TO FOLLOW ME UP THE RIVER IN ANY CRAFT THEY COULD GATHER AND WITH THIS WIND THEY WILL SOON BE AT HAND INDEED SEVERAL SHIPS HAVE ALREADY COME TO THE HARLOND I JUDGE THAT WE COULD LEAD OUT SEVEN THOUSANDS OF HORSE AND FOOT AND YET LEAVE THE CITY IN BETTER DEFENCE THAN IT WAS WHEN THE ASSAULT BEGAN
     THE GATE IS DESTROYED SAID IMRAHIL AND WHERE NOW IS THE SKILL TO REBUILD IT AND SET IT UP ANEW
     IN EREBOR IN THE KINGDOM OF DAIN THERE IS SUCH SKILL SAID ARAGORN AND IF ALL OUR HOPES DO NOT PERISH THEN IN TIME I WILL SEND GIMLI GL
     THIS THEN WAS THE END OF THE DEBATE OF THE LORDS THAT THEY SHOULD SET FORTH ON THE SECOND MORNING FROM THAT DAY WITH SEVEN THOUSANDS IF THESE MIGHT BE FOUND AND THE GREAT PART OF THIS FORCE SHOULD BE ON FOOT BECAUSE OF THE EVIL LANDS INTO WHICH THEY WOULD GO ARAGORN SHOULD FIND SOME TWO THOUSANDS OF THOSE THAT HE HAD GATHERED TO HIM IN THE SOUTH BUT IMRAHIL SHOULD FIND THREE AND A HALF THOUSANDS AND  ALL TOLD SIX THOUSAND FOOT AND A THOUSAND HORSE BUT THE MAIN STRENGTH OF THE ROHIRRIM THAT REMAINED HORSED AND ABLE TO FIGHT SOME THREE THOUSAND UNDER THE COMMAND OF ELFHELM SHOULD WAYLAY THE WEST ROAD AGAINST THE ENEMY THAT WAS IN AN NEWS THEY COULD NORTHWARDS AND EASTWARDS FROM OSGILIATH AND THE ROAD TO MINAS MORGUL
     AND WHEN THEY HAD RECKONED UP ALL THEIR STRENGTH AND TAKEN THOUGHT FOR THE JOURNEYS THEY SHOULD MAKE AND THE ROADS THEY SHOULD CHOOSE IMRAHIL SUDDENLY LAUGHED ALOUD
     SURELY HE CRIED THIS IS THE GREATEST JEST IN ALL THE HISTORY OF GONDOR THAT WE SHOULD RIDE WITH SEVEN THOUSANDS SCARCE AS MANY AS THE VANGUARD OF ITS ARMY IN THE DAYS OF ITS POWER TO ASSAIL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE IMPENETRABLE GATE OF THE BLACK LAND SO MIGHT A CHILD THREATEN A MAILCLAD KNIGHT WITH A BOW OF STRING AND GREEN WILLOW IF THE DARK LORD KNOWS SO MUCH AS YOU SAY MITHRANDIR WILL HE NOT RATHER SMILE THAN FEAR AND WITH HIS LITTLE FINGER CRUSH US LIKE A FLY THAT TRIES TO STING HIM
     NO HE WILL TRY TO TRAP THE FLY AND TAKE THE STING SAID GANDALF AND THERE ARE NAMES AMONG US THAT ARE WORTH MORE THAN A THOUSAND MAILCLAD KNIGHTS APIECE NO HE WILL NOT SMILE
     NEITHER SHALL WE SAID ARAGORN IF THIS BE JEST THEN IT IS TOO BITTER FOR LAUGHTER NAY IT IS THE LAST MOVE IN A GREAT JEOPARDY AND FOR ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER IT WILL BRING THE END OF THE GAME THEN HE DREW ANDURIL AND HELD IT UP GLITTERING IN THE SUN YOU SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED AGAIN UNTIL THE LAST BATTLE IS FOUGHT HE SAID

      CHAPTER 1
      THE TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL
     

     SAM ROUSED HIMSELF PAINFULLY FROM THE GROUND FOR A MOMENT HE WONDERED WHERE HE WAS AND THEN ALL THE MISERY AND DESPAIR RETURNED TO HIM HE WAS IN THE DEEP DARK OUTSIDE THE UNDERGATE OF THE ORCS STRONGHOLD ITS BRAZEN DOORS WERE SHUT HE MUST HAVE FALLEN STUNNED WHEN HE HURLED HIMSELF AGAINST THEM BUT HOW LONG HE HAD LAIN THERE HE DID NOT KNOW THEN HE HAD BEEN ON FIRE DESPERATE AND FURIOUS NOW HE WAS SHIVERING AND COLD HE CREPT TO THE DOORS AND PRESSED HIS EARS AGAINST THEM
     FAR WITHIN HE COULD HEAR FAINTLY THE VOICES OF ORES CLAMOURING BUT SOON THEY STOPPED OR PASSED OUT OF HEARING AND ALL WAS STILL HIS HEAD ACHED AND HIS EYES SAW PHANTOM LIGHTS IN THE DARKNESS BUT HE STRUGGLED TO STEADY HIMSELF AND THINK IT WAS CLEAR AT ANY RATE THAT HE HAD NO HOPE OF GETTING INTO THE ORCHOLD BY THAT GATE HE MIGHT WAIT THERE FOR DAYS BEFORE IT WAS OPENED AND HE COULD NOT WAIT TIME WAS DESPERATELY PRECIOUS HE NO LONGER HAD ANY DOUBT ABOUT HIS DUTY HE MUST RESCUE HIS MASTER OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT
     THE PERISHING IS MORE LIKELY AND WILL BE A LOT EASIER ANYWAY HE SAID GRIMLY TO HIMSELF AS HE SHEATHED STING AND TURNED FROM THE BRAZEN DOORS SLOWLY HE GROPED HIS WAY BACK IN THE DARK ALONG THE TUNNEL NOT DARING TO USE THE ELVENLIGHT AND AS HE WENT HE TRIED TO FIT TOGETHER THE EVENTS SINCE FRODO AND HE HAD LEFT THE CROSSROADS HE WONDERED WHAT THE TIME WAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE DAY AND THE NEXT HE SUPPOSED BUT EVEN OF THE DAYS HE HAD QUITE LOST COUNT HE WAS IN A LAND OF DARKNESS WHERE THE DAYS OF THE WORLD SEEMED FORGOTTEN AND WHERE ALL WHO ENTERED WERE FORGOTTEN TOO
     I WONDER IF THEY THINK OF US AT ALL HE SAID AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM ALL AWAY THERE HE WAVED HIS HAND VAGUELY IN THE AIR BEFORE HIM BUT HE WAS IN FACT NOW FACING SOUTHWARDS AS HE CAME BACK TO SHELOBS TUNNEL NOT WEST OUT WESTWARD IN THE WORLD IT WAS DRAWING TO NOON UPON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF MARCH IN THE SHIRERECKONING AND EVEN NOW ARAGORN WAS LEADING THE BLACK FLEET FROM PELARGIR AND MERRY WAS RIDING WITH THE ROHIRRIM DOWN THE STONEWAIN VALLEY WHILE IN MINAS TIRITH FLAMES WERE RISING AND PIPPIN WATCHED THE MADNESS GROWING IN THE EYES OF DENETHOR YET AMID ALL THEIR CARES AND FEAR THE THOUGHTS OF THEIR FRIENDS TURNED CONSTANTLY TO FRODO AND SAM THEY WERE NOT FORGOTTEN BUT THEY WERE FAR BEYOND AID AND NO THOUGHT COULD YET BRING ANY HELP TO SAMWISE HAMFASTS SON HE WAS UTTERLY ALONE
     HE CAME BACK AT LAST TO THE STONE DOOR OF THE ORCPASSAGE AND STILL UNABLE TO DISCOVER THE CATCH OR BOLT THAT HELD IT HE SCRAMBLED OVER AS BEFORE AND DROPPED SOFTLY TO THE GROUND THEN HE MADE HIS WAY STEALTHILY TO THE OUTLET OF SHELOBS TUNNEL WHERE THE RAGS OF HER GREAT WEB WERE STILL BLOWING AND SWAYING IN THE COLD AIRS FOR COLD THEY SEEMED TO SAM AFTER THE NOISOME DARKNESS BEHIND BUT THE BREATH OF THEM REVIVED HIM HE CREPT CAUTIOUSLY OUT
     ALL WAS OMINOUSLY QUIET THE LIGHT WAS NO MORE THAN THAT OF DUSK AT A DARK DAYS END THE VAST VAPOURS THAT AROSE IN MORDOR AND WENT STREAMING WESTWARD PASSED LOW OVERHEAD A GREAT WELTER OF CLOUD AND SMOKE NOW LIT AGAIN BENEATH WITH A SULLEN GLOW OF RED
     SAM LOOKED UP TOWARDS THE ORCTOWER AND SUDDENLY FROM ITS NARROW WINDOWS LIGHTS STARED OUT LIKE SMALL RED EYES HE WONDERED IF THEY WERE SOME SIGNAL HIS FEAR OF THE ORCS FORGOTTEN FOR A WHILE IN HIS WRATH AND DESPERATION NOW RETURNED AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE THERE WAS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE COURSE FOR HIM TO TAKE HE MUST GO ON AND TRY TO FIND THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE DREADFUL TOWER BUT HIS KNEES FELT WEAK AND HE FOUND THAT HE WAS TREMBLING DRAWING HIS EYES DOWN FROM THE TOWER AND THE HORNS OF THE CLEFT BEFORE HIM HE FORCED HIS UNWILLING FEET TO OBEY HIM AND SLOWLY LISTENING WITH ALL HIS EARS PEERING INTO THE DENSE SHADOWS OF THE ROCKS BESIDE THE WAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS PAST THE PLACE WHERE FRODO FELL AND STILL THE STENCH OF SHELOB LINGERED AND THEN ON AND UP UNTIL HE STOOD AGAIN IN THE VERY CLEFT WHERE HE HAD PUT ON THE RING AND SEEN SHAGRATS COMPANY GO BY
     THERE HE HALTED AND SAT DOWN FOR THE MOMENT HE COULD DRIVE HIMSELF NO FURTHER HE FELT THAT IF ONCE HE WENT BEYOND THE CROWN OF THE PASS AND TOOK ONE STEP VERITABLY DOWN INTO THE LAND OF MORDOR THAT STEP WOULD BE IRREVOCABLE HE COULD NEVER COME BACK WITHOUT ANY CLEAR PURPOSE HE DREW OUT THE RING AND PUT IT ON AGAIN IMMEDIATELY HE FELT THE GREAT BURDEN OF ITS WEIGHT AND FELT AFRESH BUT NOW MORE STRONG AND URGENT THAN EVER THE MALICE OF THE EYE OF MORDOR SEARCHING TRYING TO PIERCE THE SHADOWS THAT IT HAD MADE FOR ITS OWN DEFENCE BUT WHICH NOW HINDERED IT IN ITS UNQUIET AND DOUBT
     AS BEFORE SAM FOUND THAT HIS HEARING WAS SHARPENED BUT THAT TO HIS SIGHT THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD SEEMED THIN AND VAGUE THE ROCKY WALLS OF THE PATH WERE PALE AS IF SEEN THROUGH A MIST BUT STILL AT A DISTANCE HE HEARD THE BUBBLING OF SHELOB IN HER MISERY AND HARSH AND CLEAR AND VERY CLOSE IT SEEMED HE HEARD CRIES AND THE CLASH OF METAL HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND PRESSED HIMSELF AGAINST THE WALL BESIDE THE ROAD HE WAS GLAD OF THE RING FOR HERE WAS YET ANOTHER COMPANY OF ORCS ON THE MARCH OR SO AT FIRST HE THOUGHT THEN SUDDENLY HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT SO HIS HEARING HAD DECEIVED HIM THE ORCCRIES CAME FROM THE TOWER WHOSE TOPMOST HORN WAS NOW RIGHT ABOVE HIM ON THE LEFT HAND OF THE CLEFT
     SAM SHUDDERED AND TRIED TO FORCE HIMSELF TO MOVE THERE WAS PLAINLY SOME DEVILRY GOING ON PERHAPS IN SPITE OF ALL ORDERS THE CRUELTY OF THE ORCS HAD MASTERED THEM AND THEY WERE TORMENTING FRODO OR EVEN SAVAGELY HACKING HIM TO PIECES HE LISTENED AND AS HE DID A GLEAM OF HOPE CAME TO HIM THERE COULD NOT BE MUCH DOUBT THERE WAS FIGHTING IN THE TOWER THE ORCS MUST BE AT WAR AMONG THEMSELVES SHAGRAT AND GORBAG HAD COME TO BLOWS FAINT AS WAS THE HOPE THAT HIS GUESS BROUGHT HIM IT WAS ENOUGH TO ROUSE HIM THERE MIGHT BE JUST A CHANCE HIS LOVE FOR FRODO ROSE ABOVE ALL OTHER THOUGHTS AND FORGETTING HIS PERIL HE CRIED ALOUD IM COMING MR FRODO
     HE RAN FORWARD TO THE CLIMBING PATH AND OVER IT AT ONCE THE ROAD TURNED LEFT AND PLUNGED STEEPLY DOWN SAM HAD CROSSED INTO MORDOR
     HE TOOK OFF THE RING MOVED IT MAY BE BY SOME DEEP PREMONITION OF DANGER THOUGH TO HIMSELF HE THOUGHT ONLY THAT HE WISHED TO SEE MORE CLEARLY BETTER HAVE A LOOK AT THE WORST HE MUTTERED NO GOOD BLUNDERING ABOUT IN A FOG
     HARD AND CRUEL AND BITTER WAS THE LAND THAT MET HIS GAZE BEFORE HIS FEET THE HIGHEST RIDGE OF THE EPHEL DUATH FELL STEEPLY IN GREAT CLIFFS DOWN INTO A DARK TROUGH ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF WHICH THERE ROSE ANOTHER RIDGE MUCH LOWER ITS EDGE NOTCHED AND JAGGED WITH CRAGS LIKE FANGS THAT STOOD OUT BLACK AGAINST THE RED LIGHT BEHIND THEM IT WAS THE GRIM MORGAI THE INNER RING OF THE FENCES OF THE LAND FAR BEYOND IT BUT ALMOST STRAIGHT AHEAD ACROSS A WIDE LAKE OF DARKNESS DOTTED WITH TINY FIRES THERE WAS A GREAT BURNING GLOW AND FROM IT ROSE IN HUGE COLUMNS A SWIRLING SMOKE DUSTY RED AT THE ROOTS BLACK ABOVE WHERE IT MERGED INTO THE BILLOWING CANOPY THAT ROOFED IN ALL THE ACCURSED LAND
     SAM WAS LOOKING AT ORODRUIN THE MOUNTAIN OF FIRE EVER AND ANON THE FURNACES FAR BELOW ITS ASHEN CONE WOULD GROW HOT AND WITH A GREAT SURGING AND THROBBING POUR FORTH RIVERS OF MOLTEN ROCK FROM CHASMS IN ITS SIDES SOME WOULD FLOW BLAZING TOWARDS BARADDUR DOWN GREAT CHANNELS SOME WOULD WIND THEIR WAY INTO THE STONY PLAIN UNTIL THEY COOLED AND LAY LIKE TWISTED DRAGONSHAPES VOMITED FROM THE TORMENTED EARTH IN SUCH AN HOUR OF LABOUR SAM BEHELD MOUNT DOOM AND THE LIGHT OF IT CUT OFF BY THE HIGH SCREEN OF THE EPHEL DUATH FROM THOSE WHO CLIMBED UP THE PATH FROM THE WEST NOW GLARED AGAINST THE STARK ROCK FACES SO THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE DRENCHED WITH BLOOD
     IN THAT DREADFUL LIGHT SAM STOOD AGHAST FOR NOW LOOKING TO HIS LEFT HE COULD SEE THE TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL IN ALL ITS STRENGTH THE HORN THAT HE HAD SEEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE WAS ONLY ITS TOPMOST TURRET ITS EASTERN FACE STOOD UP IN THREE GREAT TIERS FROM A SHELF IN THE MOUNTAINWALL FAR BELOW ITS BACK WAS TO A GREAT CLIFF BEHIND FROM WHICH IT JUTTED OUT IN POINTED BASTIONS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER DIMINISHING AS THEY ROSE WITH SHEER SIDES OF CUNNING MASONRY THAT LOOKED NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST ABOUT THE LOWEST TIER TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW WHERE SAM NOW STOOD THERE WAS A BATTLEMENTED WALL ENCLOSING A NARROW COURT ITS GATE UPON THE NEAR SOUTHEASTERN SIDE OPENED ON A BROAD ROAD THE OUTER PARAPET OF WHICH RAN UPON THE BRINK OF A PRECIPICE UNTIL IT TURNED SOUTHWARD AND WENT WINDING DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS TO JOIN THE ROAD THAT CAME OVER THE MORGUL PASS THEN ON IT WENT THROUGH A JAGGED RIFT IN THE MORGAI OUT INTO THE VALLEY OF GORGOROTH AND AWAY TO BARADDUR THE NARROW UPPER WAY ON WHICH SAM STOOD LEAPT SWIFTLY DOWN BY STAIR AND STEEP PATH TO MEET THE MAIN ROAD UNDER THE FROWNING WALLS CLOSE TO THE TOWERGATE
     
     AS HE GAZED AT IT SUDDENLY SAM UNDERSTOOD ALMOST WITH A SHOCK THAT THIS STRONGHOLD HAD BEEN BUILT NOT TO KEEP ENEMIES OUT OF MORDOR BUT TO KEEP THEM IN IT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE WORKS OF GONDOR LONG AGO AN EASTERN OUTPOST OF THE DEFENCES OF ITHILIEN MADE WHEN AFTER THE LAST ALLIANCE MEN OF WESTERNESSE KEPT WATCH ON THE EVIL LAND OF SAURON WHERE HIS CREATURES STILL LURKED BUT AS WITH NARCHOST AND CARCHOST THE TOWERS OF THE TEETH SO HERE TOO THE VIGILANCE HAD FAILED AND TREACHERY HAD YIELDED UP THE TOWER TO THE LORD OF THE RINGWRAITHS AND NOW FOR LONG YEARS IT HAD BEEN HELD BY EVIL THINGS SINCE HIS RETURN TO MORDOR SAURON HAD FOUND IT USEFUL FOR HE HAD FEW SERVANTS BUT MANY SLAVES OF FEAR AND STILL ITS CHIEF PURPOSE AS OF OLD WAS TO PREVENT ESCAPE FROM MORDOR THOUGH IF AN ENEMY WERE SO RASH AS TO TRY TO ENTER THAT LAND SECRETLY THEN IT WAS ALSO A LAST UNSLEEPING GUARD AGAINST ANY THAT MIGHT PASS THE VIGILANCE OF MORGUL AND OF SHELOB
     ONLY TOO CLEARLY SAM SAW HOW HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOR HIM TO CREEP DOWN UNDER THOSE MANYEYED WALLS AND PASS THE WATCHFUL GATE AND EVEN IF HE DID SO HE COULD NOT GO FAR ON THE GUARDED ROAD BEYOND NOT EVEN THE BLACK SHADOWS LYING DEEP WHERE THE RED GLOW COULD NOT REACH WOULD SHIELD HIM LONG FROM THE NIGHTEYED ORCS BUT DESPERATE AS THAT ROAD MIGHT BE HIS TASK WAS NOW FAR WORSE NOT TO AVOID THE GATE AND ESCAPE BUT TO ENTER IT ALONE
     HIS THOUGHT TURNED TO THE RING BUT THERE WAS NO COMFORT THERE ONLY DREAD AND DANGER NO SOONER HAD HE COME IN SIGHT OF MOUNT DOOM BURNING FAR AWAY THAN HE WAS AWARE OF A CHANGE IN HIS BURDEN AS IT DREW NEAR THE GREAT FURNACES WHERE IN THE DEEPS OF TIME IT HAD BEEN SHAPED AND FORGED THE RINGS POWER GREW AND IT BECAME MORE FELL UNTAMEABLE SAVE BY SOME MIGHTY WILL AS SAM STOOD THERE EVEN THOUGH THE RING WAS NOT ON HIM BUT HANGING BY ITS CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK HE FELT HIMSELF ENLARGED AS IF HE WERE ROBED IN A HUGE DISTORTED SHADOW OF HIMSELF A VAST AND OMINOUS THREAT HALTED UPON THE WALLS OF MORDOR HE FELT THAT HE HAD FROM NOW ON ONLY TWO CHOICES TO FORBEAR THE RING THOUGH IT WOULD TORMENT HIM OR TO CLAIM IT AND CHALLENGE THE POWER THAT SAT IN ITS DARK HOLD BEYOND THE VALLEY OF SHADOWS ALREADY THE RING TEMPTED HIM GNAWING AT HIS WILL AND REASON WILD FANTASIES AROSE IN HIS MIND AND HE SAW SAMWISE THE STRONG HERO OF THE AGE STRIDING WITH A FLAMING SWORD ACROSS THE DARKENED LAND AND ARMIES FLOCKING TO HIS CALL AS HE MARCHED TO THE OVERTHROW OF BARADDUR AND THEN ALL THE CLOUDS ROLLED AWAY AND THE WHITE SUN SHONE AND AT HIS COMMAND THE VALE OF GORGOROTH BECAME A GARDEN OF FLOWERS AND TREES AND BROUGHT FORTH FRUIT HE HAD ONLY TO PUT ON THE RING AND CLAIM IT FOR HIS OWN AND ALL THIS COULD BE
     IN THAT HOUR OF TRIAL IT WAS THE LOVE OF HIS MASTER THAT HELPED MOST TO HOLD HIM FIRM BUT ALSO DEEP DOWN IN HIM LIVED STILL UNCONQUERED HIS PLAIN HOBBITSENSE HE KNEW IN THE CORE OF HIS HEART THAT HE WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO BEAR SUCH A BURDEN EVEN IF SUCH VISIONS WERE NOT A MERE CHEAT TO BETRAY HIM THE ONE SMALL GARDEN OF A FREE GARDENER WAS ALL HIS NEED AND DUE NOT A GARDEN SWOLLEN TO A REALM HIS OWN HANDS TO USE NOT THE HANDS OF OTHERS TO COMMAND
     AND ANYWAY ALL THESE NOTIONS ARE ONLY A TRICK HE SAID TO HIMSELF HED SPOT ME AND COW ME BEFORE I COULD SO MUCH AS SHOUT OUT HED SPOT ME PRETTY QUICK IF I PUT THE RING ON NOW IN MORDOR WELL ALL I CAN SAY IS THINGS LOOK AS HOPELESS AS A FROST IN SPRING JUST WHEN BEING INVISIBLE WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL I CANT USE THE RING AND IF EVER I GET ANY FURTHER ITS GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT A DRAG AND A BURDEN EVERY STEP SO WHATS TO BE DONE
     HE WAS NOT REALLY IN ANY DOUBT HE KNEW THAT HE MUST GO DOWN TO THE GATE AND NOT LINGER ANY MORE WITH A SHRUG OF HIS SHOULDERS AS IF TO SHAKE OFF THE SHADOW AND DISMISS THE PHANTOMS HE BEGAN SLOWLY TO DESCEND WITH EACH STEP HE SEEMED TO DIMINISH HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE HAD SHRUNK AGAIN TO A VERY SMALL AND FRIGHTENED HOBBIT HE WAS NOW PASSING UNDER THE VERY WALLS OF THE TOWER AND THE CRIES AND SOUNDS OF FIGHTING COULD BE HEARD WITH HIS UNAIDED EARS AT THE MOMENT THE NOISE SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM THE COURT BEHIND THE OUTER WALL
     SAM WAS ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE PATH WHEN OUT OF THE DARK GATEWAY INTO THE RED GLOW THERE CAME TWO ORCS RUNNING THEY DID NOT TURN TOWARDS HIM THEY WERE MAKING FOR THE MAIN ROAD BUT EVEN AS THEY RAN THEY STUMBLED AND FELL TO THE GROUND AND LAY STILL SAM HAD SEEN NO ARROWS BUT HE GUESSED THAT THE ORCS HAD BEEN SHOT DOWN BY OTHERS ON THE BATTLEMENTS OR HIDDEN IN THE SHADOW OF THE GATE HE WENT ON HUGGING THE WALL ON HIS LEFT ONE LOOK UPWARD HAD SHOWN HIM THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF CLIMBING IT THE STONEWORK ROSE THIRTY FEET WITHOUT A CRACK OR LEDGE TO OVERHANGING COURSES LIKE INVERTED STEPS THE GATE WAS THE ONLY WAY
     HE CREPT ON AND AS HE WENT HE WONDERED HOW MANY ORCS LIVED IN THE TOWER WITH SHAGRAT AND HOW MANY GORBAG HAD AND WHAT THEY WERE QUARRELLING ABOUT IF THAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING SHAGRATS COMPANY HAD SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FORTY AND GORBAGS MORE THAN TWICE AS LARGE BUT OF COURSE SHAGRATS PATROL HAD ONLY BEEN A PART OF HIS GARRISON ALMOST CERTAINLY THEY WERE QUARRELLING ABOUT FRODO AND THE SPOIL FOR A SECOND SAM HALTED FOR SUDDENLY THINGS SEEMED CLEAR TO HIM ALMOST AS IF HE HAD SEEN THEM WITH HIS EYES THE MITHRIL COAT OF COURSE FRODO WAS WEARING IT AND THEY WOULD FIND IT AND FROM WHAT SAM HAD HEARD GORBAG WOULD COVET IT BUT THE ORDERS OF THE DARK TOWER WERE AT PRESENT FRODOS ONLY PROTECTION AND IF THEY WERE SET ASIDE FRODO MIGHT BE KILLED OUT OF HAND AT ANY MOMENT
     COME ON YOU MISERABLE SLUGGARD SAM CRIED TO HIMSELF NOW FOR IT HE DREW STING AND RAN TOWARDS THE OPEN GATE BUT JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PASS UNDER ITS GREAT ARCH HE FELT A SHOCK AS IF HE HAD RUN INTO SOME WEB LIKE SHELOBS ONLY INVISIBLE HE COULD SEE NO OBSTACLE BUT SOMETHING TOO STRONG FOR HIS WILL TO OVERCOME BARRED THE WAY HE LOOKED ABOUT AND THEN WITHIN THE SHADOW OF THE GATE HE SAW THE TWO WATCHERS
     THEY WERE LIKE GREAT FIGURES SEATED UPON THRONES EACH HAD THREE JOINED BODIES AND THREE HEADS FACING OUTWARD AND INWARD AND ACROSS THE GATEWAY THE HEADS HAD VULTUREFACES AND ON THEIR GREAT KNEES WERE LAID CLAWLIKE HANDS THEY SEEMED TO BE CARVED OUT OF HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE IMMOVABLE AND YET THEY WERE AWARE SOME DREADFUL SPIRIT OF EVIL VIGILANCE ABODE IN THEM THEY KNEW AN ENEMY VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE NONE COULD PASS UNHEEDED THEY WOULD FORBID HIS ENTRY OR HIS ESCAPE
     HARDENING HIS WILL SAM THRUST FORWARD ONCE AGAIN AND HALTED WITH A JERK STAGGERING AS IF FROM A BLOW UPON HIS BREAST AND HEAD THEN GREATLY DARING BECAUSE HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE TO DO ANSWERING A SUDDEN THOUGHT THAT CAME TO HIM HE DREW SLOWLY OUT THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL AND HELD IT UP ITS WHITE LIGHT QUICKENED SWIFTLY AND THE SHADOWS UNDER THE DARK ARCH FLED THE MONSTROUS WATCHERS SAT THERE COLD AND STILL REVEALED IN ALL THEIR HIDEOUS SHAPE FOR A MOMENT SAM CAUGHT A GLITTER IN THE BLACK STONES OF THEIR EYES THE VERY MALICE OF WHICH MADE HIM QUAIL BUT SLOWLY HE FELT THEIR WILL WAVER AND CRUMBLE INTO FEAR
     HE SPRANG PAST THEM BUT EVEN AS HE DID SO THRUSTING THE PHIAL BACK INTO HIS BOSOM HE WAS AWARE AS PLAINLY AS IF A BAR OF STEEL HAD SNAPPED TO BEHIND HIM THAT THEIR VIGILANCE WAS RENEWED AND FROM THOSE EVIL HEADS THERE CAME A HIGH SHRILL CRY THAT ECHOED IN THE TOWERING WALLS BEFORE HIM FAR UP ABOVE LIKE AN ANSWERING SIGNAL A HARSH BELL CLANGED A SINGLE STROKE
     THATS DONE IT SAID SAM NOW IVE RUNG THE FRONTDOOR BELL WELL COME ON SOMEBODY HE CRIED TELL CAPTAIN SHAGRAT THAT THE GREAT ELFWARRIOR HAS CALLED WITH HIS ELFSWORD TOO
     THERE WAS NO ANSWER SAM STRODE FORWARD STING GLITTERED BLUE IN HIS HAND THE COURTYARD LAY IN DEEP SHADOW BUT HE COULD SEE THAT THE PAVEMENT WAS STREWN WITH BODIES RIGHT AT HIS FEET WERE TWO ORCARCHERS WITH KNIVES STICKING IN THEIR BACKS BEYOND LAY MANY MORE SHAPES SOME SINGLY AS THEY HAD BEEN HEWN DOWN OR SHOT OTHERS IN PAIRS STILL GRAPPLING ONE ANOTHER DEAD IN THE VERY THROES OF STABBING THROTTLING BITING THE STONES WERE SLIPPERY WITH DARK BLOOD
     TWO LIVERIES SAM NOTICED ONE MARKED BY THE RED EYE THE OTHER BY A MOON DISFIGURED WITH A GHASTLY FACE OF DEATH BUT HE DID NOT STOP TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY ACROSS THE COURT A GREAT DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE TOWER STOOD HALF OPEN AND A RED LIGHT CAME THROUGH A LARGE ORC LAY DEAD UPON THE THRESHOLD SAM SPRANG OVER THE BODY AND WENT IN AND THEN HE PEERED ABOUT AT A LOSS
     A WIDE AND ECHOING PASSAGE LED BACK FROM THE DOOR TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINSIDE IT WAS DIMLY LIT WITH TORCHES FLARING IN BRACKETS ON THE WALLS BUT ITS DISTANT END WAS LOST IN GLOOM MANY DOORS AND OPENINGS COULD BE SEEN ON THIS SIDE AND THAT BUT IT WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR TWO OR THREE MORE BODIES SPRAWLING ON THE FLOOR FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD OF THE CAPTAINS TALK SAM KNEW THAT DEAD OR ALIVE FRODO WOULD MOST LIKELY BE FOUND IN A CHAMBER HIGH UP IN THE TURRET FAR ABOVE BUT HE MIGHT SEARCH FOR A DAY BEFORE HE FOUND THE WAY
     ITLL BE NEAR THE BACK I GUESS SAM MUTTERED THE WHOLE TOWER CLIMBS BACKWARDSLIKE AND ANYWAY ID BETTER FOLLOW THESE LIGHTS
     HE ADVANCED DOWN THE PASSAGE BUT SLOWLY NOW EACH STEP MORE RELUCTANT TERROR WAS BEGINNING TO GRIP HIM AGAIN THERE WAS NO SOUND SAVE THE RAP OF HIS FEET WHICH SEEMED TO GROW TO AN ECHOING NOISE LIKE THE SLAPPING OF GREAT HANDS UPON THE STONES THE DEAD BODIES THE EMPTINESS THE DANK BLACK WALLS THAT IN THE TORCHLIGHT SEEMED TO DRIP WITH BLOOD THE FEAR OF SUDDEN DEATH LURKING IN DOORWAY OR SHADOW AND BEHIND ALL HIS MIND THE WAITING WATCHFUL MALICE AT THE GATE IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN HE COULD SCREW HIMSELF TO FACE HE WOULD HAVE WELCOMED A FIGHT  WITH NOT TOO MANY ENEMIES AT A TIME  RATHER THAN THIS HIDEOUS BROODING UNCERTAINTY HE FORCED HIMSELF TO THINK OF FRODO LYING BOUND OR IN PAIN OR DEAD SOMEWHERE IN THIS DREADFUL PLACE HE WENT ON
     HE HAD PASSED BEYOND THE TORCHLIGHT ALMOST TO A GREAT ARCHED DOOR AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE THE INNER SIDE OF THE UNDER GATE AS HE RIGHTLY GUESSED WHEN THERE CAME FROM HIGH ABOVE A DREADFUL CHOKING SHRIEK HE STOPPED SHORT THEN HE HEARD FEET COMING SOMEONE WAS RUNNING IN GREAT HASTE DOWN AN ECHOING STAIRWAY OVERHEAD
     HIS WILL WAS TOO WEAK AND SLOW TO RESTRAIN HIS HAND IT DRAGGED AT THE CHAIN AND CLUTCHED THE RING BUT SAM DID NOT PUT IT ON FOR EVEN AS HE CLASPED IT TO HIS BREAST AN ORC CAME CLATTERING DOWN LEAPING OUT OF A DARK OPENING AT THE RIGHT IT RAN TOWARDS HIM IT WAS NO MORE THAN SIX PACES FROM HIM WHEN LIFTING ITS HEAD IT SAW HIM AND SAM COULD HEAR ITS GASPING BREATH AND SEE THE GLARE IN ITS BLOODSHOT EYES IT STOPPED SHORT AGHAST FOR WHAT IT SAW WAS NOT A SMALL FRIGHTENED HOBBIT TRYING TO HOLD A STEADY SWORD IT SAW A GREAT SILENT SHAPE CLOAKED IN A GREY SHADOW LOOMING AGAINST THE WAVERING LIGHT BEHIND IN ONE HAND IT HELD A SWORD THE VERY LIGHT OF WHICH WAS A BITTER PAIN THE OTHER WAS CLUTCHED AT ITS BREAST BUT HELD CONCEALED SOME NAMELESS MENACE OF POWER AND DOOM
     FOR A MOMENT THE ORC CROUCHED AND THEN WITH A HIDEOUS YELP OF FEAR IT TURNED AND FLED BACK AS IT HAD COME NEVER WAS ANY DOG MORE HEARTENED WHEN ITS ENEMY TURNED TAIL THAN SAM AT THIS UNEXPECTED FLIGHT WITH A SHOUT HE GAVE CHASE
     YES THE ELFWARRIOR IS LOOSE HE CRIED IM COMING JUST YOU SHOW ME THE WAY UP OR ILL SKIN YOU
     BUT THE ORC WAS IN ITS OWN HAUNTS NIMBLE AND WELLFED SAM WAS A STRANGER HUNGRY AND WEARY THE STAIRS WERE HIGH AND STEEP AND WINDING SAMS BREATH BEGAN TO COME IN GASPS THE ORC HAD SOON PASSED OUT OF SIGHT AND NOW ONLY FAINTLY COULD BE HEARD THE SLAPPING OF ITS FEET AS IT WENT ON AND UP EVERY NOW AND AGAIN IT GAVE A YELL AND THE ECHO RAN ALONG THE WALLS BUT SLOWLY ALL SOUND OF IT DIED AWAY
     SAM PLODDED ON HE FELT THAT HE WAS ON THE RIGHT ROAD AND HIS SPIRITS HAD RISEN A GOOD DEAL HE THRUST THE RING AWAY AND TIGHTENED HIS BELT WELL WELL HE SAID IF ONLY THEY ALL TAKE SUCH A DISLIKE TO ME AND MY STING THIS MAY TURN OUT BETTER THAN I HOPED AND ANYWAY IT LOOKS AS IF SHAGRAT GORBAG AND COMPANY HAVE DONE NEARLY ALL MY JOB FOR ME EXCEPT FOR THAT LITTLE FRIGHTENED RAT I DO BELIEVE THERES NOBODY LEFT ALIVE IN THE PLACE
     AND WITH THAT HE STOPPED BROUGHT UP HARD AS IF HE HAD HIT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE STONE WALL THE FULL MEANING OF WHAT HE HAD SAID STRUCK HIM LIKE A BLOW NOBODY LEFT ALIVE WHOSE HAD BEEN THAT HORRIBLE DYING SHRIEK FRODO FRODO MASTER HE CRIED HALF SOBBING IF THEYVE KILLED YOU WHAT SHALL I DO WELL IM COMING AT LAST RIGHT TO THE TOP TO SEE WHAT I MUST
     UP UP HE WENT IT WAS DARK SAVE FOR AN OCCASIONAL TORCH FLARING AT A TURN OR BESIDE SOME OPENING THAT LED INTO THE HIGHER LEVELS OF THE TOWER SAM TRIED TO COUNT THE STEPS BUT AFTER TWO HUNDRED HE LOST HIS RECKONING HE WAS MOVING QUIETLY NOW FOR HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF VOICES TALKING STILL SOME WAY ABOVE MORE THAN ONE RAT REMAINED ALIVE IT SEEMED
     ALL AT ONCE WHEN HE FELT THAT HE COULD PUMP OUT NO MORE BREATH NOR FORCE HIS KNEES TO BEND AGAIN THE STAIR ENDED HE STOOD STILL THE VOICES WERE NOW LOUD AND NEAR SAM PEERED ABOUT HE HAD CLIMBED RIGHT TO THE FLAT ROOF OF THE THIRD AND HIGHEST TIER OF THE TOWER AN OPEN SPACE ABOUT TWENTY YARDS ACROSS WITH A LOW PARAPET THERE THE STAIR WAS COVERED BY A SMALL DOMED CHAMBER IN THE MIDST OF THE ROOF WITH LOW DOORS FACING EAST AND WEST EASTWARD SAM COULD SEE THE PLAIN OF MORDOR VAST AND DARK BELOW AND THE BURNING MOUNTAIN FAR AWAY A FRESH TURMOIL WAS SURGING IN ITS DEEP WELLS AND THE RIVERS OF FIRE BLAZED SO FIERCELY THAT EVEN AT THIS DISTANCE OF MANY MILES THE LIGHT OF THEM LIT THE TOWERTOP WITH A RED GLARE WESTWARD THE VIEW WAS BLOCKED BY THE BASE OF THE GREAT TURRET THAT STOOD AT THE BACK OF THIS UPPER COURT AND REARED ITS HORN HIGH ABOVE THE CREST OF THE ENCIRCLING HILLS LIGHT GLEAMED IN A WINDOWSLIT ITS DOOR WAS NOT TEN YARDS FROM WHERE SAM STOOD IT WAS OPEN BUT DARK AND FROM JUST WITHIN ITS SHADOW THE VOICES CAME
     AT FIRST SAM DID NOT LISTEN HE TOOK A PACE OUT OF THE EASTWARD DOOR AND LOOKED ABOUT AT ONCE HE SAW THAT UP HERE THE FIGHTING HAD BEEN FIERCEST ALL THE COURT WAS CHOKED WITH DEAD ORCS OR THEIR SEVERED AND SCATTERED HEADS AND LIMBS THE PLACE STANK OF DEATH A SNARL FOLLOWED BY A BLOW AND A CRY SENT HIM DARTING BACK INTO HIDING AN ORCVOICE ROSE IN ANGER AND HE KNEW IT AGAIN AT ONCE HARSH BRUTAL COLD IT WAS SHAGRAT SPEAKING CAPTAIN OF THE TOWER

     SO THATS IT IS IT YELLED SHAGRAT YOULL DO THIS AND YOULL NOT DO THAT AND WHEN HE DOES COME YOULL BOLT AND LEAVE ME NO YOU WONT ILL PUT RED MAGGOTHOLES IN YOUR BELLY FIRST
     OUT OF THE TURRETDOOR THE SMALLER ORC CAME FLYING BEHIND HIM CAME SHAGRAT A LARGE ORC WITH LONG ARMS THAT AS HE RAN CROUCHING REACHED TO THE GROUND BUT ONE ARM HUNG LIMP AND SEEMED TO BE BLEEDING THE OTHER HUGGED A LARGE BLACK BUNDLE IN THE RED GLARE SAM COWERING BEHIND THE STAIRDOOR CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIS EVIL FACE AS IT PASSED IT WAS SCORED AS IF BY RENDING CLAWS AND SMEARED WITH BLOOD SLAVER DRIPPED FROM ITS PROTRUDING FANGS THE MOUTH SNARLED LIKE AN ANIMAL
     AS FAR AS SAM COULD SEE SHAGRAT HUNTED SNAGA ROUND THE ROOF UNTIL DUCKING AND ELUDING HIM THE SMALLER ORC WITH A YELP DARTED BACK INTO THE TURRET AND DISAPPEARED THEN SHAGRAT HALTED OUT OF THE EASTWARD DOOR SAM COULD SEE HIM NOW BY THE PARAPET PANTING HIS LEFT CLAW CLENCHING AND UNCLENCHING FEEBLY HE PUT THE BUNDLE ON THE FLOOR AND WITH HIS RIGHT CLAW DREW OUT A LONG RED KNIFE AND SPAT ON IT GOING TO THE PARAPET HE LEANED OVER LOOKING DOWN INTO THE OUTER COURT FAR BELOW TWICE HE SHOUTED BUT NO ANSWER CAME
     SUDDENLY AS SHAGRAT WAS STOOPED OVER THE BATTLEMENT HIS BACK TO THE ROOFTOP SAM TO HIS AMAZEMENT SAW THAT ONE OF THE SPRAWLING BODIES WAS MOVING IT WAS CRAWLING IT PUT OUT A CLAW AND CLUTCHED THE BUNDLE IT STAGGERED UP IN ITS OTHER HAND IT HELD A BROADHEADED SPEAR WITH A SHORT BROKEN HAFT IT WAS POISED FOR A STABBING THRUST BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT A HISS ESCAPED ITS TEETH A GASP OF PAIN OR HATE QUICK AS A SNAKE SHAGRAT SLIPPED ASIDE TWISTED ROUND AND DROVE HIS KNIFE INTO HIS ENEMYS THROAT
     GOT YOU GORBAG HE CRIED NOT QUITE DEAD EH WELL ILL FINISH MY JOB NOW HE SPRANG ON TO THE FALLEN BODY AND STAMPED AND TRAMPLED IT IN HIS FURY STOOPING NOW AND AGAIN TO STAB AND SLASH IT WITH HIS KNIFE SATISFIED AT LAST HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LET OUT A HORRIBLE GURGLING YELL OF TRIUMPH THEN HE LICKED HIS KNIFE AND PUT IT BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND CATCHING UP THE BUNDLE HE CAME LOPING TOWARDS THE NEAR DOOR OF THE STAIRS
     SAM HAD NO TIME TO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED OUT OF THE OTHER DOOR BUT HARDLY WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND HE COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED HIDEANDSEEK WITH THIS HIDEOUS ORC FOR LONG HE DID WHAT WAS PROBABLY THE BEST THING HE COULD HAVE DONE HE SPRANG OUT TO MEET SHAGRAT WITH A SHOUT HE WAS NO LONGER HOLDING THE RING BUT IT WAS THERE A HIDDEN POWER A COWING MENACE TO THE SLAVES OF MORDOR AND IN HIS HAND WAS STING AND ITS LIGHT SMOTE THE EYES OF THE ORC LIKE THE GLITTER OF CRUEL STARS IN THE TERRIBLE ELFCOUNTRIES THE DREAM OF WHICH WAS A COLD FEAR TO ALL HIS KIND AND SHAGRAT COULD NOT BOTH FIGHT AND KEEP HOLD OF HIS TREASURE HE STOPPED GROWLING BARING HIS FANGS THEN ONCE MORE ORCFASHION HE LEAPT ASIDE AND AS SAM SPRANG AT HIM USING THE HEAVY BUNDLE AS BOTH SHIELD AND WEAPON HE THRUST IT HARD INTO HIS ENEMYS FACE SAM STAGGERED AND BEFORE HE COULD RECOVER SHAGRAT DARTED PAST AND DOWN THE STAIRS
     SAM RAN AFTER HIM CURSING BUT HE DID NOT GO FAR SOON THE THOUGHT OF FRODO RETURNED TO HIM AND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OTHER ORC HAD GONE BACK INTO THE TURRET HERE WAS ANOTHER DREADFUL CHOICE AND HE HAD NO TIME TO PONDER IT IF SHAGRAT GOT AWAY HE WOULD SOON GET HELP AND COME BACK BUT IF SAM PURSUED HIM THE OTHER ORC MIGHT DO SOME HORRIBLE DEED UP THERE AND ANYWAY SAM MIGHT MISS SHAGRAT OR BE KILLED BY HIM HE TURNED QUICKLY AND RAN BACK UP THE STAIRS WRONG AGAIN I EXPECT HE SIGHED BUT ITS MY JOB TO GO RIGHT UP TO THE TOP FIRST WHATEVER HAPPENS AFTERWARDS
     AWAY BELOW SHAGRAT WENT LEAPING DOWN THE STAIRS AND OUT OVER THE COURT AND THROUGH THE GATE BEARING HIS PRECIOUS BURDEN IF SAM COULD HAVE SEEN HIM AND KNOWN THE GRIEF THAT HIS ESCAPE WOULD BRING HE MIGHT HAVE QUAILED BUT NOW HIS MIND WAS SET ON THE LAST STAGE OF HIS SEARCH HE CAME CAUTIOUSLY TO THE TURRETDOOR AND STEPPED INSIDE IT OPENED INTO DARKNESS BUT SOON HIS STARING EYES WERE AWARE OF A DIM LIGHT AT HIS RIGHT HAND IT CAME FROM AN OPENING THAT LED TO ANOTHER STAIRWAY DARK AND NARROW IT APPEARED TO GO WINDING UP THE TURRET ALONG THE INSIDE OF ITS ROUND OUTER WALL A TORCH WAS GLIMMERING FROM SOMEWHERE UP ABOVE
     SOFTLY SAM BEGAN TO CLIMB HE CAME TO THE GUTTERING TORCH FIXED ABOVE A DOOR ON HIS LEFT THAT FACED A WINDOWSLIT LOOKING OUT WESTWARD ONE OF THE RED EYES THAT HE AND FRODO HAD SEEN FROM DOWN BELOW BY THE TUNNELS MOUTH QUICKLY SAM PASSED THE DOOR AND HURRIED ON TO THE SECOND STOREY DREADING AT ANY MOMENT TO HE ATTACKED AND TO FEEL THROTTLING FINGERS SEIZE HIS THROAT FROM BEHIND HE CAME NEXT TO A WINDOW LOOKING EAST AND ANOTHER TORCH ABOVE THE DOOR TO A PASSAGE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE TURRET THE DOOR WAS OPEN THE PASSAGE DARK SAVE FOR THE GLIMMER OF THE TORCH AND THE RED GLARE FROM OUTSIDE FILTERING THROUGH THE WINDOWSLIT BUT HERE THE STAIR STOPPED AND CLIMBED NO FURTHER SAM CREPT INTO THE PASSAGE ON EITHER SIDE THERE WAS A LOW DOOR BOTH WERE CLOSED AND LOCKED THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL
     A DEAD END MUTTERED SAM AND AFTER ALL MY CLIMB THIS CANT BE THE TOP OF THE TOWER BUT WHAT CAN I DO NOW
     HE RAN BACK TO THE LOWER STOREY AND TRIED THE DOOR IT WOULD NOT MOVE HE RAN UP AGAIN AND SWEAT BEGAN TO TRICKLE DOWN HIS FACE HE FELT THAT EVEN MINUTES WERE PRECIOUS BUT ONE BY ONE THEY ESCAPED AND HE COULD DO NOTHING HE CARED NO LONGER FOR SHAGRAT OR SNAGA OR ANY OTHER ORC THAT WAS EVER SPAWNED HE LONGED ONLY FOR HIS MASTER FOR ONE SIGHT OF HIS FACE OR ONE TOUCH OF HIS HAND
     AT LAST WEARY AND FEELING FINALLY DEFEATED HE SAT ON A STEP BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE PASSAGEFLOOR AND BOWED HIS HEAD INTO HIS HANDS IT WAS QUIET HORRIBLY QUIET THE TORCH THAT WAS ALREADY BURNING LOW WHEN HE ARRIVED SPUTTERED AND WENT OUT AND HE FELT THE DARKNESS COVER HIM LIKE A TIDE AND THEN SOFTLY TO HIS OWN SURPRISE THERE AT THE VAIN END OF HIS LONG JOURNEY AND HIS GRIEF MOVED BY WHAT THOUGHT IN HIS HEART HE COULD NOT TELL SAM BEGAN TO SING
     HIS VOICE SOUNDED THIN AND QUAVERING IN THE COLD DARK TOWER THE VOICE OF A FORLORN AND WEARY HOBBIT THAT NO LISTENING ORC COULD POSSIBLY MISTAKE FOR THE CLEAR SONG OF AN ELVENLORD HE MURMURED OLD CHILDISH TUNES OUT OF THE SHIRE AND SNATCHES OF MR BILBOS RHYMES THAT CAME INTO HIS MIND LIKE FLEETING GLIMPSES OF THE COUNTRY OF HIS HOME AND THEN SUDDENLY NEW STRENGTH ROSE IN HIM AND HIS VOICE RANG OUT WHILE WORDS OF HIS OWN CAME UNBIDDEN TO FIT THE SIMPLE TUNE
     
      
       IN WESTERN LANDS BENEATH THE SUN

       THE FLOWERS MAY RISE IN SPRING

       THE TREES MAY BUD THE WATERS RUN

       THE MERRY FINCHES SING

       OR THERE MAYBE TIS CLOUDLESS NIGHT

       AND SWAYING BEECHES BEAR

       THE ELVENSTARS AS JEWELS WHITE

       AMID THEIR BRANCHING HAIR

      

      
       THOUGH HERE AT JOURNEYS END I LIE

       IN DARKNESS BURIED DEEP

       BEYOND ALL TOWERS STRONG AND HIGH

       BEYOND ALL MOUNTAINS STEEP

       ABOVE ALL SHADOWS RIDES THE SUN

       AND STARS FOR EVER DWELL

       I WILL NOT SAY THE DAY IS DONE

       NOR BID THE STARS FAREWELL

      

     
     BEYOND ALL TOWERS STRONG AND HIGH HE BEGAN AGAIN AND THEN HE STOPPED SHORT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD HEARD A FAINT VOICE ANSWERING HIM BUT NOW HE COULD HEAR NOTHING YES HE COULD HEAR SOMETHING BUT NOT A VOICE FOOTSTEPS WERE APPROACHING NOW A DOOR WAS BEING OPENED QUIETLY IN THE PASSAGE ABOVE THE HINGES CREAKED SAM CROUCHED DOWN LISTENING THE DOOR CLOSED WITH A DULL THUD AND THEN A SNARLING ORCVOICE RANG OUT

     AS FRODO AND SAM STOOD AND GAZED THE RIM OF LIGHT SPREAD ALL ALONG THE LINE OF THE EPHEL DUATH AND THEN THEY SAW A SHAPE MOVING AT A GREAT SPEED OUT OF THE WEST AT FIRST ONLY A BLACK SPECK AGAINST THE GLIMMERING STRIP ABOVE THE MOUNTAINTOPS BUT GROWING UNTIL IT PLUNGED LIKE A BOLT INTO THE DARK CANOPY AND PASSED HIGH ABOVE THEM AS IT WENT IT SENT OUT A LONG SHRILL CRY THE VOICE OF A NAZG
     WHAT DID I TELL YOU SOMETHINGS HAPPENING CRIED SAM THE WARS GOING WELL SAID SHAGRAT BUT GORBAG HE WASNT SO SURE AND HE WAS RIGHT THERE TOO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP MR FRODO HAVENT YOU GOT SOME HOPE NOW
     WELL NO NOT MUCH SAM FRODO SIGHED THATS AWAY BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS WERE GOING EAST NOT WEST AND IM SO TIRED AND THE RING IS SO HEAVY SAM AND I BEGIN TO SEE IT IN MY MIND ALL THE TIME LIKE A GREAT WHEEL OF FIRE
     SAMS QUICK SPIRITS SANK AGAIN AT ONCE HE LOOKED AT HIS MASTER ANXIOUSLY AND HE TOOK HIS HAND COME MR FRODO HE SAID IVE GOT ONE THING I WANTED A BIT OF LIGHT ENOUGH TO HELP US AND YET I GUESS ITS DANGEROUS TOO TRY A BIT FURTHER AND THEN WELL LIE CLOSE AND HAVE A REST BUT TAKE A MORSEL TO EAT NOW A BIT OF THE ELVES FOOD IT MAY HEARTEN YOU
     SHARING A WAFER OF LEMBAS AND MUNCHING IT AS BEST THEY COULD WITH THEIR PARCHED MOUTHS FRODO AND SAM PLODDED ON THE LIGHT THOUGH NO MORE THAN A GREY DUSK WAS NOW ENOUGH FOR THEM TO SEE THAT THEY WERE DEEP IN THE VALLEY BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS IT SLOPED UP GENTLY NORTHWARD AND AT ITS BOTTOM WENT THE BED OF A NOW DRY AND WITHERED STREAM BEYOND ITS STONY COURSE THEY SAW A BEATEN PATH THAT WOUND ITS WAY UNDER THE FEET OF THE WESTWARD CLIFFS HAD THEY KNOWN THEY COULD HAVE REACHED IT QUICKER FOR IT WAS A TRACK THAT LEFT THE MAIN MORGULROAD AT THE WESTERN BRIDGEEND AND WENT DOWN BY A LONG STAIR CUT IN THE ROCK TO THE VALLEYS BOTTOM IT WAS USED BY PATROLS OR BY MESSENGERS GOING SWIFTLY TO LESSER POSTS AND STRONGHOLDS NORTHAWAY BETWEEN CIRITH UNGOL AND THE NARROWS OF ISENMOUTHE THE IRON JAWS OF CARACH ANGREN
     IT WAS PERILOUS FOR THE HOBBITS TO USE SUCH A PATH BUT THEY NEEDED SPEED AND FRODO FELT THAT HE COULD NOT FACE THE TOIL OF SCRAMBLING AMONG THE BOULDERS OR IN THE TRACKLESS GLENS OF THE MORGAI AND HE JUDGED THAT NORTHWARD WAS MAYBE THE WAY THAT THEIR HUNTERS WOULD LEAST EXPECT THEM TO TAKE THE ROAD EAST TO THE PLAIN OR THE PASS BACK WESTWARD THOSE THEY WOULD FIRST SEARCH MOST THOROUGHLY ONLY WHEN HE WAS WELL NORTH OF THE TOWER DID HE MEAN TO TURN AND SEEK FOR SOME WAY TO TAKE HIM EAST EAST ON THE LAST DESPERATE STAGE OF HIS JOURNEY SO NOW THEY CROSSED THE STONY BED AND TOOK TO THE ORCPATH AND FOR SOME TIME THEY MARCHED ALONG IT THE CLIFFS AT THEIR LEFT WERE OVERHUNG AND THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM ABOVE BUT THE PATH MADE MANY BENDS AND AT EACH BEND THEY GRIPPED THEIR SWORDHILTS AND WENT FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
     THE LIGHT GREW NO STRONGER FOR ORODRUIN WAS STILL BELCHING FORTH A GREAT FUME THAT BEATEN UPWARDS BY THE OPPOSING AIRS MOUNTED HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL IT REACHED A REGION ABOVE THE WIND AND SPREAD IN AN IMMEASURABLE ROOF WHOSE CENTRAL PILLAR ROSE OUT OF THE SHADOWS BEYOND THEIR VIEW THEY HAD TRUDGED FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR WHEN THEY HEARD A SOUND THAT BROUGHT THEM TO A HALT UNBELIEVABLE BUT UNMISTAKABLE WATER TRICKLING OUT OF A GULLY ON THE LEFT SO SHARP AND NARROW THAT IT LOOKED AS IF THE BLACK CLIFF HAD BEEN CLOVEN BY SOME HUGE AXE WATER CAME DRIPPING DOWN THE LAST REMAINS MAYBE OF SOME SWEET RAIN GATHERED FROM SUNLIT SEAS BUT ILLFATED TO FALL AT LAST UPON THE WALLS OF THE BLACK LAND AND WANDER FRUITLESS DOWN INTO THE DUST HERE IT CAME OUT OF THE ROCK IN A LITTLE FALLING STREAMLET AND FLOWED ACROSS THE PATH AND TURNING SOUTH RAN AWAY SWIFTLY TO BE LOST AMONG THE DEAD STONES
     SAM SPRANG TOWARDS IT IF EVER I SEE THE LADY AGAIN I WILL TELL HER HE CRIED LIGHT AND NOW WATER THEN HE STOPPED LET ME DRINK FIRST MR FRODO HE SAID
     ALL RIGHT BUT THERES ROOM ENOUGH FOR TWO
     I DIDNT MEAN THAT SAID SAM I MEAN IF ITS POISONOUS OR SOMETHING THAT WILL SHOW ITS BADNESS QUICK WELL BETTER ME THAN YOU MASTER IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME
     I DO BUT I THINK WELL TRUST OUR LUCK TOGETHER SAM OR OUR BLESSING STILL BE CAREFUL NOW IF ITS VERY COLD
     THE WATER WAS COOL BUT NOT ICY AND IT HAD AN UNPLEASANT TASTE AT ONCE BITTER AND OILY OR SO THEY WOULD HAVE SAID AT HOME HERE IT SEEMED BEYOND ALL PRAISE AND BEYOND FEAR OR PRUDENCE THEY DRANK THEIR FILL AND SAM REPLENISHED HIS WATERBOTTLE AFTER THAT FRODO FELT EASIER AND THEY WENT ON FOR SEVERAL MILES UNTIL THE BROADENING OF THE ROAD AND THE BEGINNINGS OF A ROUGH WALL ALONG ITS EDGE WARNED THEM THAT THEY WERE DRAWING NEAR TO ANOTHER ORCHOLD
     THIS IS WHERE WE TURN ASIDE SAM SAID FRODO AND WE MUST TURN EAST HE SIGHED AS HE LOOKED AT THE GLOOMY RIDGES ACROSS THE VALLEY I HAVE JUST ABOUT ENOUGH STRENGTH LEFT TO FIND SOME HOLE AWAY UP THERE AND THEN I MUST REST A LITTLE
     THE RIVERBED WAS NOW SOME WAY BELOW THE PATH THEY SCRAMBLED DOWN TO IT AND BEGAN TO CROSS IT TO THEIR SURPRISE THEY CAME UPON DARK POOLS FED BY THREADS OF WATER TRICKLING DOWN FROM SOME SOURCE HIGHER UP THE VALLEY UPON ITS OUTER MARGES UNDER THE WESTWARD MOUNTAINS MORDOR WAS A DYING LAND BUT IT WAS NOT YET DEAD AND HERE THINGS STILL GREW HARSH TWISTED BITTER STRUGGLING FOR LIFE IN THE GLENS OF THE MORGAI ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY LOW SCRUBBY TREES LURKED AND CLUNG COARSE GREY GRASSTUSSOCKS FOUGHT WITH THE STONES AND WITHERED MOSSES CRAWLED ON THEM AND EVERYWHERE GREAT WRITHING TANGLED BRAMBLES SPRAWLED SOME HAD LONG STABBING THORNS SOME HOOKED BARBS THAT RENT LIKE KNIVES THE SULLEN SHRIVELLED LEAVES OF A PAST YEAR HUNG ON THEM GRATING AND RATTLING IN THE SAD AIRS BUT THEIR MAGGOTRIDDEN BUDS WERE ONLY JUST OPENING FLIES DUN OR GREY OR BLACK MARKED LIKE ORCS WITH A RED EYESHAPED BLOTCH BUZZED AND STUNG AND ABOVE THE BRIARTHICKETS CLOUDS OF HUNGRY MIDGES DANCED AND REELED
     ORCGEARS NO GOOD SAID SAM WAVING HIS ARMS I WISH ID GOT AN ORCS HIDE
     AT LAST FRODO COULD GO NO FURTHER THEY HAD CLIMBED UP A NARROW SHELVING RAVINE BUT THEY STILL HAD A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN COME IN SIGHT OF THE LAST CRAGGY RIDGE I MUST REST NOW SAM AND SLEEP IF I CAN SAID FRODO HE LOOKED ABOUT BUT THERE SEEMED NOWHERE EVEN FOR AN ANIMAL TO CRAWL INTO IN THIS DISMAL COUNTRY AT LENGTH TIRED OUT THEY SLUNK UNDER A CURTAIN OF BRAMBLES THAT HUNG DOWN LIKE A MAT OVER A LOW ROCKFACE
     THERE THEY SAT AND MADE SUCH A MEAL AS THEY COULD KEEPING BACK THE PRECIOUS LEMBAS FOR THE EVIL DAYS AHEAD THEY ATE THE HALF OF WHAT REMAINED IN SAMS BAG OF FARAMIRS PROVISION SOME DRIED FRUIT AND A SMALL SLIP OF CURED MEAT AND THEY SIPPED SOME WATER THEY HAD DRUNK AGAIN FROM THE POOLS IN THE VALLEY BUT THEY WERE VERY THIRSTY AGAIN THERE WAS A BITTER TANG IN THE AIR OF MORDOR THAT DRIED THE MOUTH WHEN SAM THOUGHT OF WATER EVEN HIS HOPEFUL SPIRIT QUAILED BEYOND THE MORGAI THERE WAS THE DREADFUL PLAIN OF GORGOROTH TO CROSS
     NOW YOU GO TO SLEEP FIRST MR FRODO HE SAID ITS GETTING DARK AGAIN I RECKON THIS DAY IS NEARLY OVER
     FRODO SIGHED AND WAS ASLEEP ALMOST BEFORE THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN SAM STRUGGLED WITH HIS OWN WEARINESS AND HE TOOK FRODOS HAND AND THERE HE SAT SILENT TILL DEEP NIGHT FELL THEN AT LAST TO KEEP HIMSELF AWAKE HE CRAWLED FROM THE HIDINGPLACE AND LOOKED OUT THE LAND SEEMED FULL OF CREAKING AND CRACKING AND SLY NOISES BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF VOICE OR OF FOOT FAR ABOVE THE EPHEL DUATH IN THE WEST THE NIGHTSKY WAS STILL DIM AND PALE THERE PEEPING AMONG THE CLOUDWRACK ABOVE A DARK TOR HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS SAM SAW A WHITE STAR TWINKLE FOR A WHILE THE BEAUTY OF IT SMOTE HIS HEART AS HE LOOKED UP OUT OF THE FORSAKEN LAND AND HOPE RETURNED TO HIM FOR LIKE A SHAFT CLEAR AND COLD THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIM THAT IN THE END THE SHADOW WAS ONLY A SMALL AND PASSING THING THERE WAS LIGHT AND HIGH BEAUTY FOR EVER BEYOND ITS REACH HIS SONG IN THE TOWER HAD BEEN DEFIANCE RATHER THAN HOPE FOR THEN HE WAS THINKING OF HIMSELF NOW FOR A MOMENT HIS OWN FATE AND EVEN HIS MASTERS CEASED TO TROUBLE HIM HE CRAWLED BACK INTO THE BRAMBLES AND LAID HIMSELF BY FRODOS SIDE AND PUTTING AWAY ALL FEAR HE CAST HIMSELF INTO A DEEP UNTROUBLED SLEEP
     THEY WOKE TOGETHER HAND IN HAND SAM WAS ALMOST FRESH READY FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT FRODO SIGHED HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN UNEASY FULL OF DREAMS OF FIRE AND WAKING BROUGHT HIM NO COMFORT STILL HIS SLEEP HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT ALL HEALING VIRTUE HE WAS STRONGER MORE ABLE TO BEAR HIS BURDEN ONE STAGE FURTHER THEY DID NOT KNOW THE TIME NOR HOW LONG THEY HAD SLEPT BUT AFTER A MORSEL OF FOOD AND A SIP OF WATER THEY WENT ON UP THE RAVINE UNTIL IT ENDED IN A SHARP SLOPE OF SCREES AND SLIDING STONES THERE THE LAST LIVING THINGS GAVE UP THEIR STRUGGLE THE TOPS OF THE MORGAI WERE GRASSLESS BARE JAGGED BARREN AS A SLATE
     AFTER MUCH WANDERING AND SEARCH THEY FOUND A WAY THAT THEY COULD CLIMB AND WITH A LAST HUNDRED FEET OF CLAWING SCRAMBLE THEY WERE UP THEY CAME TO A CLEFT BETWEEN TWO DARK CRAGS AND PASSING THROUGH FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE LAST FENCE OF MORDOR BELOW THEM AT THE BOTTOM OF A FALL OF SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET LAY THE INNER PLAIN STRETCHING AWAY INTO A FORMLESS GLOOM BEYOND THEIR SIGHT THE WIND OF THE WORLD BLEW NOW FROM THE WEST AND THE GREAT CLOUDS WERE LIFTED HIGH FLOATING AWAY EASTWARD BUT STILL ONLY A GREY LIGHT CAME TO THE DREARY FIELDS OF GORGOROTH THERE SMOKES TRAILED ON THE GROUND AND LURKED IN HOLLOWS AND FUMES LEAKED FROM FISSURES IN THE EARTH
     STILL FAR AWAY FORTY MILES AT LEAST THEY SAW MOUNT DOOM ITS FEET FOUNDED IN ASHEN RUIN ITS HUGE CONE RISING TO A GREAT HEIGHT WHERE ITS REEKING HEAD WAS SWATHED IN CLOUD ITS FIRES WERE NOW DIMMED AND IT STOOD IN SMOULDERING SLUMBER AS THREATENING AND DANGEROUS AS A SLEEPING BEAST BEHIND IT THERE HUNG A VAST SHADOW OMINOUS AS A THUNDERCLOUD THE VEILS OF BARADDUR THAT WAS REARED FAR WAY UPON A LONG SPUR OF THE ASHEN MOUNTAINS THRUST DOWN FROM THE NORTH THE DARK POWER WAS DEEP IN THOUGHT AND THE EYE TURNED INWARD PONDERING TIDINGS OF DOUBT AND DANGER A BRIGHT SWORD AND A STERN AND KINGLY FACE IT SAW AND FOR A WHILE IT GAVE LITTLE THOUGHT TO OTHER THINGS AND ALL ITS GREAT STRONGHOLD GATE ON GATE AND TOWER ON TOWER WAS WRAPPED IN A BROODING GLOOM
     FRODO AND SAM GAZED OUT IN MINGLED LOATHING AND WONDER ON THIS HATEFUL LAND BETWEEN THEM AND THE SMOKING MOUNTAIN AND ABOUT IT NORTH AND SOUTH ALL SEEMED RUINOUS AND DEAD A DESERT BURNED AND CHOKED THEY WONDERED HOW THE LORD OF THIS REALM MAINTAINED AND FED HIS SLAVES AND HIS ARMIES YET ARMIES HE HAD AS FAR AS THEIR EYES COULD REACH ALONG THE SKIRTS OF THE MORGAI AND AWAY SOUTHWARD THERE WERE CAMPS SOME OF TENTS SOME ORDERED LIKE SMALL TOWNS ONE OF THE LARGEST OF THESE WAS RIGHT BELOW THEM BARELY A MILE OUT INTO THE PLAIN IT CLUSTERED LIKE SOME HUGE NEST OF INSECTS WITH STRAIGHT DREARY STREETS OF HUTS AND LONG LOW DRAB BUILDINGS ABOUT IT THE GROUND WAS BUSY WITH FOLK GOING TO AND FRO A WIDE ROAD RAN FROM IT SOUTHEAST TO JOIN THE MORGULWAY AND ALONG IT MANY LINES OF SMALL BLACK SHAPES WERE HURRYING
     I DONT LIKE THE LOOK OF THINGS AT ALL SAID SAM PRETTY HOPELESS I CALL IT  SAVING THAT WHERE THERES SUCH A LOT OF FOLK THERE MUST BE WELLS OR WATER NOT TO MENTION FOOD AND THESE ARE MEN NOT ORCS OR MY EYES ARE ALL WRONG
     NEITHER HE NOR FRODO KNEW ANYTHING OF THE GREAT SLAVEWORKED FIELDS AWAY SOUTH IN THIS WIDE REALM BEYOND THE FUMES OF THE MOUNTAIN BY THE DARK SAD WATERS OF LAKE NURNEN NOR OF THE GREAT ROADS THAT RAN AWAY EAST AND SOUTH TO TRIBUTARY LANDS FROM WHICH THE SOLDIERS OF THE TOWER BROUGHT LONG WAGGONTRAINS OF GOODS AND BOOTY AND FRESH SLAVES HERE IN THE NORTHWARD REGIONS WERE THE MINES AND FORGES AND THE MUSTERINGS OF LONGPLANNED WAR AND HERE THE DARK POWER MOVING ITS ARMIES LIKE PIECES ON THE BOARD WAS GATHERING THEM TOGETHER ITS FIRST MOVES THE FIRST FEELERS OF ITS STRENGTH HAD BEEN CHECKED UPON ITS WESTERN LINE SOUTHWARD AND NORTHWARD FOR THE MOMENT IT WITHDREW THEM AND BROUGHT UP NEW FORCES MASSING THEM ABOUT CIRITH GORGOR FOR AN AVENGING STROKE AND IF IT HAD ALSO BEEN ITS PURPOSE TO DEFEND THE MOUNTAIN AGAINST ALL APPROACH IT COULD SCARCELY HAVE DONE MORE
     WELL SAM WENT ON WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO EAT AND DRINK WE CANT GET IT THERES NO WAY DOWN THAT I CAN SEE AND WE COULDNT CROSS ALL THAT OPEN COUNTRY CRAWLING WITH ENEMIES EVEN IF WE DID GET DOWN
     STILL WE SHALL HAVE TO TRY SAID FRODO ITS NO WORSE THAN I EXPECTED I NEVER HOPED TO GET ACROSS I CANT SEE ANY HOPE OF IT NOW BUT IVE STILL GOT TO DO THE BEST I CAN AT PRESENT THAT IS TO AVOID BEING CAPTURED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO WE MUST STILL GO NORTHWARDS I THINK AND SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE WHERE THE OPEN PLAIN IS NARROWER
     I GUESS WHAT ITLL BE LIKE SAID SAM WHERE ITS NARROWER THE ORCS AND MEN WILL JUST BE PACKED CLOSER YOULL SEE MR FRODO
     I DARE SAY I SHALL IF WE EVER GET SO FAR SAID FRODO AND TURNED AWAY
     THEY SOON FOUND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY ALONG THE CREST OF THE MORGAI OR ANYWHERE ALONG ITS HIGHER LEVELS PATHLESS AS THEY WERE AND SCORED WITH DEEP GHYLLS IN THE END THEY WERE FORCED TO GO BACK DOWN THE RAVINE THAT THEY HAD CLIMBED AND SEEK FOR A WAY ALONG THE VALLEY IT WAS ROUGH GOING FOR THEY DARED NOT CROSS OVER TO THE PATH ON THE WESTWARD SIDE AFTER A MILE OR MORE THEY SAW HUDDLED IN A HOLLOW AT THE CLIFFS FOOT THE ORCHOLD THAT THEY HAD GUESSED WAS NEAR AT HAND A WALL AND A CLUSTER OF STONE HUTS SET ABOUT THE DARK MOUTH OF A CAVE THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT TO BE SEEN BUT THE HOBBITS CREPT BY CAUTIOUSLY KEEPING AS MUCH AS THEY COULD TO THE THORNBRAKES THAT GREW THICKLY AT THIS POINT ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE OLD WATERCOURSE
     THEY WENT TWO OR THREE MILES FURTHER AND THE ORCHOLD WAS HIDDEN FROM SIGHT BEHIND THEM BUT THEY HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AGAIN WHEN HARSH AND LOUD THEY HEARD ORCVOICES QUICKLY THEY SLUNK OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND A BROWN AND STUNTED BUSH THE VOICES DREW NEARER PRESENTLY TWO ORCS CAME INTO VIEW ONE WAS CLAD IN RAGGED BROWN AND WAS ARMED WITH A BOW OF HORN IT WAS OF A SMALL BREED BLACKSKINNED WITH WIDE AND SNUFFLING NOSTRILS EVIDENTLY A TRACKER OF SOME KIND THE OTHER WAS A BIG FIGHTINGORC LIKE THOSE OF SHAGRATS COMPANY BEARING THE TOKEN OF THE EYE HE ALSO HAD A BOW AT HIS BACK AND CARRIED A SHORT BROADHEADED SPEAR AS USUAL THEY WERE QUARRELLING AND BEING OF DIFFERENT BREEDS THEY USED THE COMMON SPEECH AFTER THEIR FASHION

     WHOSE BLAMES THAT SAID THE SOLDIER NOT MINE THAT COMES FROM HIGHER UP FIRST THEY SAY ITS A GREAT ELF IN BRIGHT ARMOUR THEN ITS A SORT OF SMALL DWARFMAN THEN IT MUST BE A PACK OF REBEL URUKHAI OR MAYBE ITS ALL THE LOT TOGETHER

     I DONT KNOW NOTHING MAYBE BUT HES UP TO NO GOOD NOSING AROUND ILL WAGER CURSE HIM NO SOONER HAD HE SLIPPED US AND RUN OFF THAN WORD CAME HES WANTED ALIVE WANTED QUICK
     WELL I HOPE THEY GET HIM AND PUT HIM THROUGH IT GROWLED THE TRACKER HE MESSED UP THE SCENT BACK THERE PINCHING THAT CASTOFF MAILSHIRT THAT HE FOUND AND PADDLING ALL ROUND THE PLACE BEFORE I COULD GET THERE
     IT SAVED HIS LIFE ANYHOW SAID THE SOLDIER WHY BEFORE I KNEW HE WAS WANTED I SHOT HIM AS NEAT AS NEAT AT FIFTY PACES RIGHT IN THE BACK BUT HE RAN ON
     GARN YOU MISSED HIM SAID THE TRACKER FIRST YOU SHOOT WILD THEN YOU RUN TOO SLOW AND THEN YOU SEND FOR THE POOR TRACKERS IVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU HE LOPED OFF

     THE BIG ORC SPEAR IN HAND LEAPT AFTER HIM BUT THE TRACKER SPRINGING BEHIND A STONE PUT AN ARROW IN HIS EYE AS HE RAN UP AND HE FELL WITH A CRASH THE OTHER RAN OFF ACROSS THE VALLEY AND DISAPPEARED
     FOR A WHILE THE HOBBITS SAT IN SILENCE AT LENGTH SAM STIRRED WELL I CALL THAT NEAT AS NEAT HE SAID IF THIS NICE FRIENDLINESS WOULD SPREAD ABOUT IN MORDOR HALF OUR TROUBLE WOULD BE OVER
     QUIETLY SAM FRODO WHISPERED THERE MAY BE OTHERS ABOUT WE HAVE EVIDENTLY HAD A VERY NARROW ESCAPE AND THE HUNT WAS HOTTER ON OUR TRACKS THAN WE GUESSED BUT THAT IS THE SPIRIT OF MORDOR SAM AND IT HAS SPREAD TO EVERY CORNER OF IT ORCS HAVE ALWAYS BEHAVED LIKE THAT OR SO ALL TALES SAY WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR OWN BUT YOU CANT GET MUCH HOPE OUT OF IT THEY HATE US FAR MORE ALTOGETHER AND ALL THE TIME IF THOSE TWO HAD SEEN US THEY WOULD HAVE DROPPED ALL THEIR QUARREL UNTIL WE WERE DEAD
     THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG SILENCE SAM BROKE IT AGAIN BUT WITH A WHISPER THIS TIME DID YOU HEAR WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT THAT GOBBLER MR FRODO I TOLD YOU GOLLUM WASNT DEAD YET DIDNT I
     YES I REMEMBER AND I WONDERED HOW YOU KNEW SAID FRODO WELL COME NOW I THINK WE HAD BETTER NOT MOVE OUT FROM HERE AGAIN UNTIL IT HAS GONE QUITE DARK SO YOU SHALL TELL ME HOW YOU KNOW AND ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IF YOU CAN DO IT QUIETLY
     ILL TRY SAID SAM BUT WHEN I THINK OF THAT STINKER I GET SO HOT L COULD SHOUT
     THERE THE HOBBITS SAT UNDER THE COVER OF THE THORNY BUSH WHILE THE DREAR LIGHT OF MORDOR FADED SLOWLY INTO A DEEP AND STARLESS NIGHT AND SAM SPOKE INTO FRODOS EAR ALL THAT HE COULD FIND WORDS FOR OF GOLLUMS TREACHEROUS ATTACK THE HORROR OF SHELOB AND HIS OWN ADVENTURES WITH THE ORCS WHEN HE HAD FINISHED FRODO SAID NOTHING BUT TOOK SAMS HAND AND PRESSED IT AT LENGTH HE STIRRED
     WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST BE GOING ON AGAIN HE SAID I WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE WE REALLY ARE CAUGHT AND ALL THE TOILING AND THE SLINKING WILL BE OVER AND IN VAIN HE STOOD UP ITS DARK AND WE CANNOT USE THE LADYS GLASS KEEP IT SAFE FOR ME SAM I HAVE NOWHERE TO KEEP IT NOW EXCEPT IN MY HAND AND I SHALL NEED BOTH HANDS IN THE BLIND NIGHT BUT STING I GIVE TO YOU I HAVE GOT AN ORCBLADE BUT I DO NOT THINK IT WILL BE MY PART TO STRIKE ANY BLOW AGAIN
     IT WAS DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS MOVING IN THE NIGHT IN THE PATHLESS LAND BUT SLOWLY AND WITH MUCH STUMBLING THE TWO HOBBITS TOILED ON HOUR BY HOUR NORTHWARD ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE STONY VALLEY WHEN A GREY LIGHT CREPT BACK OVER THE WESTERN HEIGHTS LONG AFTER DAY HAD OPENED IN THE LANDS BEYOND THEY WENT INTO HIDING AGAIN AND SLEPT A LITTLE TURN BY TURN IN HIS TIMES OF WAKING SAM WAS BUSY WITH THOUGHTS OF FOOD AT LAST WHEN FRODO ROUSED HIMSELF AND SPOKE OF EATING AND MAKING READY FOR YET ANOTHER EFFORT HE ASKED THE QUESTION THAT WAS TROUBLING HIM MOST
     BEGGING YOUR PARDON MR FRODO HE SAID BUT HAVE YOU ANY NOTION HOW FAR THERE IS STILL TO GO
     NO NOT ANY CLEAR NOTION SAM FRODO ANSWERED IN RIVENDELL BEFORE I SET OUT I WAS SHOWN A MAP OF MORDOR THAT WAS MADE BEFORE THE ENEMY CAME BACK HERE BUT I ONLY REMEMBER IT VAGUELY I REMEMBER CLEAREST THAT THERE WAS A PLACE IN THE NORTH WHERE THE WESTERN RANGE AND THE NORTHERN RANGE SEND OUT SPURS THAT NEARLY MEET THAT MUST BE TWENTY LEAGUES AT LEAST FROM THE BRIDGE BACK BY THE TOWER IT MIGHT BE A GOOD POINT AT WHICH TO CROSS BUT OF COURSE IF WE GET THERE WE SHALL BE FURTHER THAN WE WERE FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIXTY MILES FROM IT I SHOULD THINK I GUESS THAT WE HAVE GONE ABOUT TWELVE LEAGUES NORTH FROM THE BRIDGE NOW EVEN IF ALL GOES WELL I COULD HARDLY REACH THE MOUNTAIN IN A WEEK I AM AFRAID SAM THAT THE BURDEN WILL GET VERY HEAVY AND I SHALL GO STILL SLOWER AS WE GET NEARER
     SAM SIGHED THATS JUST AS I FEARED HE SAID WELL TO SAY NOTHING OF WATER WEVE GOT TO EAT LESS MR FRODO OR ELSE MOVE A BIT QUICKER AT ANY RATE WHILE WERE STILL IN THIS VALLEY ONE MORE BITE AND ALL THE FOODS ENDED SAVE THE ELVES WAYBREAD
     ILL TRY AND BE A BIT QUICKER SAM SAID FRODO DRAWING A DEEP BREATH COME ON THEN LETS START ANOTHER MARCH
     IT WAS NOT YET QUITE DARK AGAIN THEY PLODDED ALONG ON INTO THE NIGHT THE HOURS PASSED IN A WEARY STUMBLING TRUDGE WITH A FEW BRIEF HALTS AT THE FIRST HINT OF GREY LIGHT UNDER THE SKIRTS OF THE CANOPY OF SHADOW THEY HID THEMSELVES AGAIN IN A DARK HOLLOW UNDER AN OVERHANGING STONE
     SLOWLY THE LIGHT GREW UNTIL IT WAS CLEARER THAN IT YET HAD BEEN A STRONG WIND FROM THE WEST WAS NOW DRIVING THE FUMES OF MORDOR FROM THE UPPER AIRS BEFORE LONG THE HOBBITS COULD MAKE OUT THE SHAPE OF THE LAND FOR SOME MILES ABOUT THEM THE TROUGH BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MORGAI HAD STEADILY DWINDLED AS IT CLIMBED UPWARDS AND THE INNER RIDGE WAS NOW NO MORE THAN A SHELF IN THE STEEP FACES OF THE EPHEL DUATH BUT TO THE EAST IT FELL AS SHEERLY AS EVER DOWN INTO GORGOROTH AHEAD THE WATERCOURSE CAME TO AN END IN BROKEN STEPS OF ROCK FOR OUT FROM THE MAIN RANGE THERE SPRANG A HIGH BARREN SPUR THRUSTING EASTWARD LIKE A WALL TO MEET IT THERE STRETCHED OUT FROM THE GREY AND MISTY NORTHERN RANGE OF ERED LITHUI A LONG JUTTING ARM AND BETWEEN THE ENDS THERE WAS A NARROW GAP CARACH ANGREN THE ISENMOUTHE BEYOND WHICH LAY THE DEEP DALE OF UDUN IN THAT DALE BEHIND THE MORANNON WERE THE TUNNELS AND DEEP ARMOURIES THAT THE SERVANTS OF MORDOR HAD MADE FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE BLACK GATE OF THEIR LAND AND THERE NOW THEIR LORD WAS GATHERING IN HASTE GREAT FORCES TO MEET THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST UPON THE OUTTHRUST SPURS FORTS AND TOWERS WERE BUILT AND WATCHFIRES BURNED AND ALL ACROSS THE GAP AN EARTHWALL HAD BEEN RAISED AND A DEEP TRENCH DELVED THAT COULD BE CROSSED ONLY BY A SINGLE BRIDGE
     A FEW MILES NORTH HIGH UP IN THE ANGLE WHERE THE WESTERN SPUR BRANCHED AWAY FROM THE MAIN RANGE STOOD THE OLD CASTLE OF DURTHANG NOW ONE OF THE MANY ORCHOLDS THAT CLUSTERED ABOUT THE DALE OF UDUN A ROAD ALREADY VISIBLE IN THE GROWING LIGHT CAME WINDING DOWN FROM IT UNTIL ONLY A MILE OR TWO FROM WHERE THE HOBBITS LAY IT TURNED EAST AND RAN ALONG A SHELF CUT IN THE SIDE OF THE SPUR AND SO WENT DOWN INTO THE PLAIN AND ON TO THE ISENMOUTHE
     TO THE HOBBITS AS THEY LOOKED OUT IT SEEMED THAT ALL THEIR JOURNEY NORTH HAD BEEN USELESS THE PLAIN TO THEIR RIGHT WAS DIM AND SMOKY AND THEY COULD SEE THERE NEITHER CAMPS NOR TROOPS MOVING BUT ALL THAT REGION WAS UNDER THE VIGILANCE OF THE FORTS OF CARACH ANGREN
     WE HAVE COME TO A DEAD END SAM SAID FRODO IF WE GO ON WE SHALL ONLY COME UP TO THAT ORCTOWER BUT THE ONLY ROAD TO TAKE IS THAT ROAD THAT COMES DOWN FROM IT  UNLESS WE GO BACK WE CANT CLIMB UP WESTWARD OR CLIMB DOWN EASTWARD
     THEN WE MUST TAKE THE ROAD MR FRODO SAID SAM WE MUST TAKE IT AND CHANCE OUR LUCK IF THERE IS ANY LUCK IN MORDOR WE MIGHT AS WELL GIVE OURSELVES UP AS WANDER ABOUT ANY MORE OR TRY TO GO BACK OUR FOOD WONT LAST WEVE GOT TO MAKE A DASH FOR IT
     ALL RIGHT SAM SAID FRODO LEAD ME AS LONG AS YOUVE GOT ANY HOPE LEFT MINE IS GONE BUT I CANT DASH SAM ILL JUST PLOD ALONG AFTER YOU
     BEFORE YOU START ANY MORE PLODDING YOU NEED SLEEP AND FOOD MR FRODO COME AND TAKE WHAT YOU CAN GET OF THEM
     HE GAVE FRODO WATER AND AN ADDITIONAL WAFER OF THE WAYBREAD AND HE MADE A PILLOW OF HIS CLOAK FOR HIS MASTERS HEAD FRODO WAS TOO WEARY TO DEBATE THE MATTER AND SAM DID NOT TELL HIM THAT HE HAD DRUNK THE LAST DROP OF THEIR WATER AND EATEN SAMS SHARE OF THE FOOD AS WELL AS HIS OWN WHEN FRODO WAS ASLEEP SAM BENT OVER HIM AND LISTENED TO HIS BREATHING AND SCANNED HIS FACE IT WAS LINED AND THIN AND YET IN SLEEP IT LOOKED CONTENT AND UNAFRAID WELL HERE GOES MASTER SAM MUTTERED TO HIMSELF ILL HAVE TO LEAVE YOU FOR A BIT AND TRUST TO LUCK WATER WE MUST HAVE OR WELL GET NO FURTHER
     SAM CREPT OUT AND FLITTING FROM STONE TO STONE WITH MORE THAN HOBBITCARE HE WENT DOWN TO THE WATERCOURSE AND THEN FOLLOWED IT FOR SOME WAY AS IT CLIMBED NORTH UNTIL HE CAME TO THE ROCKSTEPS WHERE LONG AGO NO DOUBT ITS SPRING HAD COME GUSHING DOWN IN A LITTLE WATERFALL ALL NOW SEEMED DRY AND SILENT BUT REFUSING TO DESPAIR SAM STOOPED AND LISTENED AND TO HIS DELIGHT HE CAUGHT THE SOUND OF TRICKLING CLAMBERING A FEW STEPS UP HE FOUND A TINY STREAM OF DARK WATER THAT CAME OUT FROM THE HILLSIDE AND FILLED A LITTLE BARE POOL FROM WHICH AGAIN IT SPILLED AND VANISHED THEN UNDER THE BARREN STONES
     SAM TASTED THE WATER AND IT SEEMED GOOD ENOUGH THEN HE DRANK DEEPLY REFILLED THE BOTTLE AND TURNED TO GO BACK AT THAT MOMENT HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A BLACK FORM OR SHADOW FLITTING AMONG THE ROCKS AWAY NEAR FRODOS HIDINGPLACE BITING BACK A CRY HE LEAPT DOWN FROM THE SPRING AND RAN JUMPING FROM STONE TO STONE IT WAS A WARY CREATURE DIFFICULT TO SEE BUT SAM HAD LITTLE DOUBT ABOUT IT HE LONGED TO GET HIS HANDS ON ITS NECK BUT IT HEARD HIM COMING AND SLIPPED QUICKLY AWAY SAM THOUGHT HE SAW A LAST FLEETING GLIMPSE OF IT PEERING BACK OVER THE EDGE OF THE EASTWARD PRECIPICE BEFORE IT DUCKED AND DISAPPEARED
     WELL LUCK DID NOT LET ME DOWN MUTTERED SAM BUT THAT WAS A NEAR THING ISNT IT ENOUGH TO HAVE ORCS BY THE THOUSAND WITHOUT THAT STINKING VILLAIN COMING NOSING ROUND I WISH HE HAD BEEN SHOT HE SAT DOWN BY FRODO AND DID NOT ROUSE HIM BUT HE DID NOT DARE TO GO TO SLEEP HIMSELF AT LAST WHEN HE FELT HIS EYES CLOSING AND KNEW THAT HIS STRUGGLE TO KEEP AWAKE COULD NOT GO ON MUCH LONGER HE WAKENED FRODO GENTLY
     THAT GOLLUMS ABOUT AGAIN IM AFRAID MR FRODO HE SAID LEASTWAYS IF IT WASNT HIM THEN THERES TWO OF HIM I WENT AWAY TO FIND SOME WATER AND SPIED HIM NOSING ROUND JUST AS I TURNED BACK I RECKON IT ISNT SAFE FOR US BOTH TO SLEEP TOGETHER AND BEGGING YOUR PARDON BUT I CANT HOLD UP MY LIDS MUCH LONGER
     BLESS YOU SAM SAID FRODO LIE DOWN AND TAKE YOUR PROPER TURN BUT ID RATHER HAVE GOLLUM THAN ORCS AT ANY RATE HE WONT GIVE US AWAY TO THEM  NOT UNLESS HES CAUGHT HIMSELF
     BUT HE MIGHT DO A BIT OF ROBBERY AND MURDER ON HIS OWN GROWLED SAM KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN MR FRODO THERES A BOTTLE FULL OF WATER DRINK UP WE CAN FILL IT AGAIN WHEN WE GO ON WITH THAT SAM PLUNGED INTO SLEEP
     LIGHT WAS FADING WHEN HE WOKE FRODO SAT PROPPED AGAINST THE ROCK BEHIND BUT HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP THE WATERBOTTLE WAS EMPTY THERE WAS NO SIGN OF GOLLUM
     MORDORDARK HAD RETURNED AND THE WATCHFIRES ON THE HEIGHTS BURNED FIERCE AND RED WHEN THE HOBBITS SET OUT AGAIN ON THE MOST DANGEROUS STAGE OF ALL THEIR JOURNEY THEY WENT FIRST TO THE LITTLE SPRING AND THEN CLIMBING WARILY UP THEY CAME TO THE ROAD AT THE POINT WHERE IT SWUNG EAST TOWARDS THE ISENMOUTHE TWENTY MILES AWAY IT WAS NOT A BROAD ROAD AND IT HAD NO WALL OR PARAPET ALONG THE EDGE AND AS IT RAN ON THE SHEER DROP FROM ITS BRINK BECAME DEEPER AND DEEPER THE HOBBITS COULD HEAR NO MOVEMENTS AND AFTER LISTENING FOR A WHILE THEY SET OFF EASTWARD AT A STEADY PACE
     AFTER DOING SOME TWELVE MILES THEY HALTED A SHORT WAY BACK THE ROAD HAD BENT A LITTLE NORTHWARD AND THE STRETCH THAT THEY HAD PASSED OVER WAS NOW SCREENED FROM SIGHT THIS PROVED DISASTROUS THEY RESTED FOR SOME MINUTES AND THEN WENT ON BUT THEY HAD NOT TAKEN MANY STEPS WHEN SUDDENLY IN THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT THEY HEARD THE SOUND THAT ALL ALONG THEY HAD SECRETLY DREADED THE NOISE OF MARCHING FEET IT WAS STILL SOME WAY BEHIND THEM BUT LOOKING BACK THEY COULD SEE THE TWINKLE OF TORCHES COMING ROUND THE BEND LESS THAN A MILE AWAY AND THEY WERE MOVING FAST TOO FAST FOR FRODO TO ESCAPE BY FLIGHT ALONG THE ROAD AHEAD
     I FEARED IT SAM SAID FRODO WEVE TRUSTED TO LUCK AND IT HAS FAILED US WERE TRAPPED HE LOOKED WILDLY UP AT THE FROWNING WALL WHERE THE ROADBUILDERS OF OLD HAD CUT THE ROCK SHEER FOR MANY FATHOMS ABOVE THEIR HEADS HE RAN TO THE OTHER SIDE AND LOOKED OVER THE BRINK INTO A DARK PIT OF GLOOM WERE TRAPPED AT LAST HE SAID HE SANK TO THE GROUND BENEATH THE WALL OF ROCK AND BOWED HIS HEAD
     SEEMS SO SAID SAM WELL WE CAN BUT WAIT AND SEE AND WITH THAT HE SAT DOWN BESIDE FRODO UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CLIFF
     THEY DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT LONG THE ORCS WERE GOING AT A GREAT PACE THOSE IN THE FOREMOST FILES BORE TORCHES ON THEY CAME RED FLAMES IN THE DARK SWIFTLY GROWING NOW SAM TOO BOWED HIS HEAD HOPING THAT IT WOULD HIDE HIS FACE WHEN THE TORCHES REACHED THEM AND HE SET THEIR SHIELDS BEFORE THEIR KNEES TO HIDE THEIR FEET
     IF ONLY THEY ARE IN A HURRY AND WILL LET A COUPLE OF TIRED SOLDIERS ALONE AND PASS ON HE THOUGHT
     AND SO IT SEEMED THAT THEY WOULD THE LEADING ORCS CAME LOPING ALONG PANTING HOLDING THEIR HEADS DOWN THEY WERE A GANG OF THE SMALLER BREEDS BEING DRIVEN UNWILLING TO THEIR DARK LORDS WARS ALL THEY CARED FOR WAS TO GET THE MARCH OVER AND ESCAPE THE WHIP BESIDE THEM RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE LINE WENT TWO OF THE LARGE FIERCE URUKS CRACKING LASHES AND SHOUTING FILE AFTER FILE PASSED AND THE TELLTALE TORCHLIGHT WAS ALREADY SOME WAY AHEAD SAM HELD HIS BREATH NOW MORE THAN HALF THE LINE HAD GONE BY THEN SUDDENLY ONE OF THE SLAVEDRIVERS SPIED THE TWO FIGURES BY THE ROADSIDE HE FLICKED A WHIP AT THEM AND YELLED HI YOU GET UP THEY DID NOT ANSWER AND WITH A SHOUT HE HALTED THE WHOLE COMPANY
     COME ON YOU SLUGS HE CRIED THIS IS NO TIME FOR SLOUCHING HE TOOK A STEP TOWARDS THEM AND EVEN IN THE GLOOM HE RECOGNIZED THE DEVICES ON THEIR SHIELDS DESERTING EH HE SNARLED OR THINKING OF IT ALL YOUR FOLK SHOULD HAVE BEEN INSIDE UDUN BEFORE YESTERDAY EVENING YOU KNOW THAT UP YOU GET AND FALL IN OR ILL HAVE YOUR NUMBERS AND REPORT YOU
     THEY STRUGGLED TO THEIR FEET AND KEEPING BENT LIMPING LIKE FOOTSORE SOLDIERS THEY SHUFFLED BACK TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE LINE NO NOT AT THE REAR THE SLAVEDRIVER SHOUTED THREE FILES UP AND STAY THERE OR YOULL KNOW IT WHEN I COME DOWN THE LINE HE SENT HIS LONG WHIPLASH CRACKING OVER THEIR HEADS THEN WITH ANOTHER CRACK AND A YELL HE STARTED THE COMPANY OFF AGAIN AT A BRISK TROT
     IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR POOR SAM TIRED AS HE WAS BUT FOR FRODO IT WAS A TORMENT AND SOON A NIGHTMARE HE SET HIS TEETH AND TRIED TO STOP HIS MIND FROM THINKING AND HE STRUGGLED ON THE STENCH OF THE SWEATING ORCS ABOUT HIM WAS STIFLING AND HE BEGAN TO GASP WITH THIRST ON ON THEY WENT AND HE BENT ALL HIS WILL TO DRAW HIS BREATH AND TO MAKE HIS LEGS KEEP GOING AND YET TO WHAT EVIL END HE TOILED AND ENDURED HE DID NOT DARE TO THINK THERE WAS NO HOPE OF FALLING OUT UNSEEN NOW AND AGAIN THE ORCDRIVER FELL BACK AND JEERED AT THEM
     THERE NOW HE LAUGHED FLICKING AT THEIR LEGS WHERE THERES A WHIP THERES A WILL MY SLUGS HOLD UP ID GIVE YOU A NICE FRESHENER NOW ONLY YOULL GET AS MUCH LASH AS YOUR SKINS WILL CARRY WHEN YOU COME IN LATE TO YOUR CAMP DO YOU GOOD DONT YOU KNOW WERE AT WAR
     THEY HAD GONE SOME MILES AND THE ROAD WAS AT LAST RUNNING DOWN A LONG SLOPE INTO THE PLAIN WHEN FRODOS STRENGTH BEGAN TO GIVE OUT AND HIS WILL WAVERED HE LURCHED AND STUMBLED DESPERATELY SAM TRIED TO HELP HIM AND HOLD HIM UP THOUGH HE FELT THAT HE COULD HIMSELF HARDLY STAY THE PACE MUCH LONGER AT ANY MOMENT NOW HE KNEW THAT THE END WOULD COME HIS MASTER WOULD FAINT OR FALL AND ALL WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND THEIR BITTER EFFORTS BE IN VAIN ILL HAVE THAT BIG SLAVEDRIVING DEVIL ANYWAY HE THOUGHT
     THEN JUST AS HE WAS PUTTING HIS HAND TO THE HILT OF HIS SWORD THERE CAME AN UNEXPECTED RELIEF THEY WERE OUT ON THE PLAIN NOW AND DRAWING NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO UDUN SOME WAY IN FRONT OF IT BEFORE THE GATE AT THE BRIDGEEND THE ROAD FROM THE WEST CONVERGED WITH OTHERS COMING FROM THE SOUTH AND FROM BARADDUR ALONG ALL THE ROADS TROOPS WERE MOVING FOR THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST WERE ADVANCING AND THE DARK LORD WAS SPEEDING HIS FORCES NORTH SO IT CHANCED THAT SEVERAL COMPANIES CAME TOGETHER AT THE ROADMEETING IN THE DARK BEYOND THE LIGHT OF THE WATCHFIRES ON THE WALL AT ONCE THERE WAS GREAT JOSTLING AND CURSING AS EACH TROOP TRIED TO GET FIRST TO THE GATE AND THE ENDING OF THEIR MARCH THOUGH THE DRIVERS YELLED AND PLIED THEIR WHIPS SCUFFLES BROKE OUT AND SOME BLADES WERE DRAWN A TROOP OF HEAVYARMED URUKS FROM BARADDUR CHARGED INTO THE DURTHANG LINE AND THREW THEM INTO CONFUSION
     DAZED AS HE WAS WITH PAIN AND WEARINESS SAM WOKE UP GRASPED QUICKLY AT HIS CHANCE AND THREW HIMSELF TO THE GROUND DRAGGING FRODO DOWN WITH HIM ORCS FELL OVER THEM SNARLING AND CURSING SLOWLY ON HAND AND KNEE THE HOBBITS CRAWLED AWAY OUT OF THE TURMOIL UNTIL AT LAST UNNOTICED THEY DROPPED OVER THE FURTHER EDGE OF THE ROAD IT HAD A HIGH KERB BY WHICH TROOPLEADERS COULD GUIDE THEMSELVES IN BLACK NIGHT OR FOG AND IT WAS BANKED UP SOME FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE OPEN LAND
     THEY LAY STILL FOR A WHILE IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEEK FOR COVER IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY TO FIND BUT SAM FELT THAT THEY OUGHT AT LEAST TO GET FURTHER AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAYS AND OUT OF THE RANGE OF TORCHLIGHT
     COME ON MR FRODO HE WHISPERED ONE MORE CRAWL AND THEN YOU CAN LIE STILL
     WITH A LAST DESPAIRING EFFORT FRODO RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS HANDS AND STRUGGLED ON FOR MAYBE TWENTY YARDS THEN HE PITCHED DOWN INTO A SHALLOW PIT THAT OPENED UNEXPECTEDLY BEFORE THEM AND THERE HE LAY LIKE A DEAD THING
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 3
      MOUNT DOOM
     

     SAM PUT HIS RAGGED ORCCLOAK UNDER HIS MASTERS HEAD AND COVERED THEM BOTH WITH THE GREY ROBE OF LENMOUTHE IT SEEMED THAT IN THE CONFUSION AND THE MINGLING OF MANY COMPANIES OF VARIOUS KINDS THEY HAD NOT BEEN MISSED NOT YET AT ANY RATE
     SAM TOOK A SIP OF WATER BUT PRESSED FRODO TO DRINK AND WHEN HIS MASTER HAD RECOVERED A LITTLE HE GAVE HIM A WHOLE WAFER OF THEIR PRECIOUS WAYBREAD AND MADE HIM EAT IT THEN TOO WORN OUT EVEN TO FEEL MUCH FEAR THEY STRETCHED THEMSELVES OUT THEY SLEPT A LITTLE IN UNEASY FITS FOR THEIR SWEAT GREW CHILL ON THEM AND THE HARD STONES BIT THEM AND THEY SHIVERED OUT OF THE NORTH FROM THE BLACK GATE THROUGH CIRITH GORGOR THERE FLOWED WHISPERING ALONG THE GROUND A THIN COLD AIR
     IN THE MORNING A GREY LIGHT CAME AGAIN FOR IN THE HIGH REGIONS THE WEST WIND STILL BLEW BUT DOWN ON THE STONES BEHIND THE FENCES OF THE BLACK LAND THE AIR SEEMED ALMOST DEAD CHILL AND YET STIFLING SAM LOOKED UP OUT OF THE HOLLOW THE LAND ALL ABOUT WAS DREARY FLAT AND DRABHUED ON THE ROADS NEARBY NOTHING WAS MOVING NOW BUT SAM FEARED THE WATCHFUL EYES ON THE WALL OF THE ISENMOUTHE NO MORE THAN A FURLONG AWAY NORTHWARD SOUTHEASTWARD FAR OFF LIKE A DARK STANDING SHADOW LOOMED THE MOUNTAIN SMOKES WERE POURING FROM IT AND WHILE THOSE THAT ROSE INTO THE UPPER AIR TRAILED AWAY EASTWARD GREAT ROLLING CLOUDS FLOATED DOWN ITS SIDES AND SPREAD OVER THE LAND A FEW MILES TO THE NORTHEAST THE FOOTHILLS OF THE ASHEN MOUNTAINS STOOD LIKE SOMBRE GREY GHOSTS BEHIND WHICH THE MISTY NORTHERN HEIGHTS ROSE LIKE A LINE OF DISTANT CLOUD HARDLY DARKER THAN THE LOWERING SKY
     SAM TRIED TO GUESS THE DISTANCES AND TO DECIDE WHAT WAY THEY OUGHT TO TAKE IT LOOKS EVERY STEP OF FIFTY MILES HE MUTTERED GLOOMILY STARING AT THE THREATENING MOUNTAIN AND THATLL TAKE A WEEK IF IT TAKES A DAY WITH MR FRODO AS HE IS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND AS HE WORKED THINGS OUT SLOWLY A NEW DARK THOUGHT GREW IN HIS MIND NEVER FOR LONG HAD HOPE DIED IN HIS STAUNCH HEART AND ALWAYS UNTIL NOW HE HAD TAKEN SOME THOUGHT FOR THEIR RETURN BUT THE BITTER TRUTH CAME HOME TO HIM AT LAST AT BEST THEIR PROVISION WOULD TAKE THEM TO THEIR GOAL AND WHEN THE TASK WAS DONE THERE THEY WOULD COME TO AN END ALONE HOUSELESS FOODLESS IN THE MIDST OF A TERRIBLE DESERT THERE COULD BE NO RETURN
     SO THAT WAS THE JOB I FELT I HAD TO DO WHEN I STARTED THOUGHT SAM TO HELP MR FRODO TO THE LAST STEP AND THEN DIE WITH HIM WELL IF THAT IS THE JOB THEN I MUST DO IT BUT I WOULD DEARLY LIKE TO SEE BYWATER AGAIN AND ROSIE COTTON AND HER BROTHERS AND THE GAFFER AND MARIGOLD AND ALL I CANT THINK SOMEHOW THAT GANDALF WOULD HAVE SENT MR FRODO ON THIS ERRAND IF THERE HADNT ABEEN ANY HOPE OF HIS EVER COMING BACK AT ALL THINGS ALL WENT WRONG WHEN HE WENT DOWN IN MORIA I WISH HE HADNT HE WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING
     BUT EVEN AS HOPE DIED IN SAM OR SEEMED TO DIE IT WAS TURNED TO A NEW STRENGTH SAMS PLAIN HOBBITFACE GREW STERN ALMOST GRIM AS THE WILL HARDENED IN HIM AND HE FELT THROUGH ALL HIS LIMBS A THRILL AS IF HE WAS TURNING INTO SOME CREATURE OF STONE AND STEEL THAT NEITHER DESPAIR NOR WEARINESS NOR ENDLESS BARREN MILES COULD SUBDUE
     WITH A NEW SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY HE BROUGHT HIS EYES BACK TO THE GROUND NEAR AT HAND STUDYING THE NEXT MOVE AS THE LIGHT GREW A LITTLE HE SAW TO HIS SURPRISE THAT WHAT FROM A DISTANCE HAD SEEMED WIDE AND FEATURELESS FLATS WERE IN FACT ALL BROKEN AND TUMBLED INDEED THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE PLAINS OF GORGOROTH WAS POCKED WITH GREAT HOLES AS IF WHILE IT WAS STILL A WASTE OF SOFT MUD IT HAD BEEN SMITTEN WITH A SHOWER OF BOLTS AND HUGE SLINGSTONES THE LARGEST OF THESE HOLES WERE RIMMED WITH RIDGES OF BROKEN ROCK AND BROAD FISSURES RAN OUT FROM THEM IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS A LAND IN WHICH IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO CREEP FROM HIDING TO HIDING UNSEEN BY ALL BUT THE MOST WATCHFUL EYES POSSIBLE AT LEAST FOR ONE WHO WAS STRONG AND HAD NO NEED FOR SPEED FOR THE HUNGRY AND WORN WHO HAD FAR TO GO BEFORE LIFE FAILED IT HAD AN EVIL LOOK
     THINKING OF ALL THESE THINGS SAM WENT BACK TO HIS MASTER HE HAD NO NEED TO ROUSE HIM FRODO WAS LYING ON HIS BACK WITH EYES OPEN STARING AT THE CLOUDY SKY WELL MR FRODO SAID SAM IVE BEEN HAVING A LOOK ROUND AND THINKING A BIT THERES NOTHING ON THE ROADS AND WED BEST BE GETTING AWAY WHILE THERES A CHANCE CAN YOU MANAGE IT
     I CAN MANAGE IT SAID FRODO I MUST
     ONCE MORE THEY STARTED CRAWLING FROM HOLLOW TO HOLLOW FLITTING BEHIND SUCH COVER AS THEY COULD FIND BUT MOVING ALWAYS IN A SLANT TOWARDS THE FOOTHILLS OF THE NORTHERN RANGE BUT AS THEY WENT THE MOST EASTERLY OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED THEM UNTIL IT RAN OFF HUGGING THE SKIRTS OF THE MOUNTAINS AWAY INTO A WALL OF BLACK SHADOW FAR AHEAD NEITHER MAN NOR ORC NOW MOVED ALONG ITS FLAT GREY STRETCHES FOR THE DARK LORD HAD ALMOST COMPLETED THE MOVEMENT OF HIS FORCES AND EVEN IN THE FASTNESS OF HIS OWN REALM HE SOUGHT THE SECRECY OF NIGHT FEARING THE WINDS OF THE WORLD THAT HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM TEARING ASIDE HIS VEILS AND TROUBLED WITH TIDINGS OF BOLD SPIES THAT HAD PASSED THROUGH HIS FENCES
     THE HOBBITS HAD GONE A FEW WEARY MILES WHEN THEY HALTED FRODO SEEMED NEARLY SPENT SAM SAW THAT HE COULD NOT GO MUCH FURTHER IN THIS FASHION CRAWLING STOOPING NOW PICKING A DOUBTFUL WAY VERY SLOWLY NOW HURRYING AT A STUMBLING RUN
     IM GOING BACK ON TO THE ROAD WHILE THE LIGHT LASTS MR FRODO HE SAID TRUST TO LUCK AGAIN IT NEARLY FAILED US LAST TIME BUT IT DIDNT QUITE A STEADY PACE FOR A FEW MORE MILES AND THEN A REST
     HE WAS TAKING A FAR GREATER RISK THAN HE KNEW BUT FRODO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS BURDEN AND WITH THE STRUGGLE IN HIS MIND TO DEBATE AND ALMOST TOO HOPELESS TO CARE THEY CLIMBED ON TO THE CAUSEWAY AND TRUDGED ALONG DOWN THE HARD CRUEL ROAD THAT LED TO THE DARK TOWER ITSELF BUT THEIR LUCK HELD AND FOR THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY MET NO LIVING OR MOVING THING AND WHEN NIGHT FELL THEY VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS OF MORDOR ALL THE LAND NOW BROODED AS AT THE COMING OF A GREAT STORM FOR THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST HAD PASSED THE CROSSROADS AND SET FLAMES IN THE DEADLY FIELDS OF IMLAD MORGUL
     SO THE DESPERATE JOURNEY WENT ON AS THE RING WENT SOUTH AND THE BANNERS OF THE KINGS RODE NORTH FOR THE HOBBITS EACH DAY EACH MILE WAS MORE BITTER THAN THE ONE BEFORE AS THEIR STRENGTH LESSENED AND THE LAND BECAME MORE EVIL THEY MET NO ENEMIES BY DAY AT TIMES BY NIGHT AS THEY COWERED OR DROWSED UNEASILY IN SOME HIDING BESIDE THE ROAD THEY HEARD CRIES AND THE NOISE OF MANY FEET OR THE SWIFT PASSING OF SOME CRUELLY RIDDEN STEED BUT FAR WORSE THAN ALL SUCH PERILS WAS THE EVERAPPROACHING THREAT THAT BEAT UPON THEM AS THEY WENT THE DREADFUL MENACE OF THE POWER THAT WAITED BROODING IN DEEP THOUGHT AND SLEEPLESS MALICE BEHIND THE DARK VEIL ABOUT ITS THRONE NEARER AND NEARER IT DREW LOOMING BLACKER LIKE THE ONCOMING OF A WALL OF NIGHT AT THE LAST END OF THE WORLD
     THERE CAME AT LAST A DREADFUL NIGHTFALL AND EVEN AS THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST DREW NEAR TO THE END OF THE LIVING LANDS THE TWO WANDERERS CAME TO AN HOUR OF BLANK DESPAIR FOUR DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE THEY HAD ESCAPED FROM THE ORCS BUT THE TIME LAY BEHIND THEM LIKE AN EVERDARKENING DREAM ALL THIS LAST DAY FRODO HAD NOT SPOKEN BUT HAD WALKED HALFBOWED OFTEN STUMBLING AS IF HIS EYES NO LONGER SAW THE WAY BEFORE HIS FEET SAM GUESSED THAT AMONG ALL THEIR PAINS HE BORE THE WORST THE GROWING WEIGHT OF THE RING A BURDEN ON THE BODY AND A TORMENT TO HIS MIND ANXIOUSLY SAM HAD NOTED HOW HIS MASTERS LEFT HAND WOULD OFTEN BE RAISED AS IF TO WARD ON A BLOW OR TO SCREEN HIS SHRINKING EYES FROM A DREADFUL EYE THAT SOUGHT TO LOOK IN THEM AND SOMETIMES HIS RIGHT HAND WOULD CREEP TO HIS BREAST CLUTCHING AND THEN SLOWLY AS THE WILL RECOVERED MASTERY IT WOULD BE WITHDRAWN
     NOW AS THE BLACKNESS OF NIGHT RETURNED FRODO SAT HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS KNEES HIS ARMS HANGING WEARILY TO THE GROUND WHERE HIS HANDS LAY FEEBLY TWITCHING SAM WATCHED HIM TILL NIGHT COVERED THEM BOTH AND HID THEM FROM ONE ANOTHER HE COULD NO LONGER FIND ANY WORDS TO SAY AND HE TURNED TO HIS OWN DARK THOUGHTS AS FOR HIMSELF THOUGH WEARY AND UNDER A SHADOW OF FEAR HE STILL HAD SOME STRENGTH LEFT THE LEMBAS HAD A VIRTUE WITHOUT WHICH THEY WOULD LONG AGO HAVE LAIN DOWN TO DIE IT DID NOT SATISFY DESIRE AND AT TIMES SAMS MIND WAS FILLED WITH THE MEMORIES OF FOOD AND THE LONGING FOR SIMPLE BREAD AND MEATS AND YET THIS WAYBREAD OF THE ELVES HAD A POTENCY THAT INCREASED AS TRAVELLERS RELIED ON IT ALONE AND DID NOT MINGLE IT WITH OTHER FOODS IT FED THE WILL AND IT GAVE STRENGTH TO ENDURE AND TO MASTER SINEW AND LIMB BEYOND THE MEASURE OF MORTAL KIND BUT NOW A NEW DECISION MUST BE MADE THEY COULD NOT FOLLOW THIS ROAD ANY LONGER FOR IT WENT ON EASTWARD INTO THE GREAT SHADOW BUT THE MOUNTAIN NOW LOOMED UPON THEIR RIGHT ALMOST DUE SOUTH AND THEY MUST TURN TOWARDS IT YET STILL BEFORE IT THERE STRETCHED A WIDE REGION OF FUMING BARREN ASHRIDDEN LAND
     WATER WATER MUTTERED SAM HE HAD STINTED HIMSELF AND IN HIS PARCHED MOUTH HIS TONGUE SEEMED THICK AND SWOLLEN BUT FOR ALL HIS CARE THEY NOW HAD VERY LITTLE LEFT PERHAPS HALF HIS BOTTLE AND MAYBE THERE WERE STILL DAYS TO GO ALL WOULD LONG AGO HAVE BEEN SPENT IF THEY HAD NOT DARED TO FOLLOW THE ORCROAD FOR AT LONG INTERVALS ON THAT HIGHWAY CISTERNS HAD BEEN BUILT FOR THE USE OF TROOPS SENT IN HASTE THROUGH THE WATERLESS REGIONS IN ONE SAM HAD FOUND SOME WATER LEFT STALE MUDDIED BY THE ORCS BUT STILL SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR DESPERATE CASE YET THAT WAS NOW A DAY AGO THERE WAS NO HOPE OF ANY MORE
     AT LAST WEARIED WITH HIS CARES SAM DROWSED LEAVING THE MORROW TILL IT CAME HE COULD DO NO MORE DREAM AND WAKING MINGLED UNEASILY HE SAW LIGHTS LIKE GLOATING YES AND DARK CREEPING SHAPES AND HE HEARD NOISES AS OF WILD BEASTS OR THE DREADFUL CRIES OF TORTURED THINGS AND HE WOULD START UP TO FIND THE WORLD ALL DARK AND ONLY EMPTY BLACKNESS ALL ABOUT HIM ONCE ONLY AS HE STOOD AND STARED WILDLY ROUND DID IT SEEM THAT THOUGH NOW AWAKE HE COULD STILL SEE PALE LIGHTS LIKE EYES BUT SOON THEY FLICKERED AND VANISHED
     THE HATEFUL NIGHT PASSED SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY SUCH DAYLIGHT AS FOLLOWED WAS DIM FOR HERE AS THE MOUNTAIN DREW NEAR THE AIR WAS EVER MIRKY WHILE OUT FROM THE DARK TOWER THERE CREPT THE VEILS OF SHADOW THAT SAURON WOVE ABOUT HIMSELF FRODO WAS LYING ON HIS BACK NOT MOVING SAM STOOD BESIDE HIM RELUCTANT TO SPEAK AND YET KNOWING THAT THE WORD NOW LAY WITH HIM HE MUST SET HIS MASTERS WILL TO WORK FOR ANOTHER EFFORT AT LENGTH STOOPING AND CARESSING FRODOS BROW HE SPOKE IN HIS EAR
     WAKE UP MASTER HE SAID TIME FOR ANOTHER START
     AS IF ROUSED BY A SUDDEN BELL FRODO ROSE QUICKLY AND STOOD UP AND LOOKED AWAY SOUTHWARDS BUT WHEN HIS EYES BEHELD THE MOUNTAIN AND THE DESERT HE QUAILED AGAIN
     I CANT MANAGE IT SAM HE SAID IT IS SUCH A WEIGHT TO CARRY SUCH A WEIGHT
     SAM KNEW BEFORE HE SPOKE THAT IT WAS VAIN AND THAT SUCH WORDS MIGHT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD BUT IN HIS PITY HE COULD NOT KEEP SILENT THEN LET ME CARRY IT A BIT FOR YOU MASTER HE SAID YOU KNOW I WOULD AND GLADLY AS LONG AS I HAVE ANY STRENGTH
     A WILD LIGHT CAME INTO FRODOS EYES STAND AWAY DONT TOUCH ME HE CRIED IT IS MINE I SAY BE OFF HIS HAND STRAYED TO HIS SWORDHILT BUT THEN QUICKLY HIS VOICE CHANGED NO NO SAM HE SAID SADLY BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IT IS MY BURDEN AND NO ONE ELSE CAN BEAR IT IT IS TOO LATE NOW SAM DEAR YOU CANT HELP ME IN THAT WAY AGAIN I AM ALMOST IN ITS POWER NOW I COULD NOT GIVE IT UP AND IF YOU TRIED TO TAKE IT I SHOULD GO MAD
     SAM NODDED I UNDERSTAND HE SAID BUT IVE BEEN THINKING MR FRODO THERES OTHER THINGS WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT WHY NOT LIGHTEN THE LOAD A BIT WERE GOING THAT WAY NOW AS STRAIGHT AS WE CAN MAKE IT HE POINTED TO THE MOUNTAIN ITS NO GOOD TAKING ANYTHING WERE NOT SURE TO NEED
     FRODO LOOKED AGAIN TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN NO HE SAID WE SHANT NEED MUCH ON THAT ROAD AND AT ITS END NOTHING PICKING UP HIS ORCSHIELD HE FLUNG IT AWAY AND THREW HIS HELMET AFTER IT THEN PULLING OFF THE GREY CLOAK HE UNDID THE HEAVY BELT AND LET IT FALL TO THE GROUND AND THE SHEATHED SWORD WITH IT THE SHREDS OF THE BLACK CLOAK HE TORE OFF AND SCATTERED
     THERE ILL BE AN ORC NO MORE HE CRIED AND ILL BEAR NO WEAPON FAIR OR FOUL LET THEM TAKE ME IF THEY WILL
     SAM DID LIKEWISE AND PUT ASIDE HIS ORCGEAR AND HE TOOK OUT ALL THE THINGS IN HIS PACK SOMEHOW EACH OF THEM HAD BECOME DEAR TO HIM IF ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD BORNE THEM SO FAR WITH SO MUCH TOIL HARDEST OF ALL IT WAS TO PART WITH HIS COOKINGGEAR TEARS WELLED IN HIS EYES AT THE THOUGHT OF CASTING IT AWAY
     DO YOU REMEMBER THAT BIT OF RABBIT MR FRODO HE SAID AND OUR PLACE UNDER THE WARM BANK IN CAPTAIN FARAMIRS COUNTRY THE DAY I SAW AN OLIPHAUNT
     NO I AM AFRAID NOT SAM SAID FRODO AT LEAST I KNOW THAT SUCH THINGS HAPPENED BUT I CANNOT SEE THEM NO TASTE OF FOOD NO FEEL OF WATER NO SOUND OF WIND NO MEMORY OF TREE OR GRASS OR FLOWER NO IMAGE OF MOON OR STAR ARE LEFT TO ME I AM NAKED IN THE DARK SAM AND THERE IS NO VEIL BETWEEN ME AND THE WHEEL OF FIRE I BEGIN TO SEE IT EVEN WITH MY WAKING EYES AND ALL ELSE FADES
     SAM WENT TO HIM AND KISSED HIS HAND THEN THE SOONER WERE RID OF IT THE SOONER TO REST HE SAID HALTINGLY FINDING NO BETTER WORDS TO SAY TALKING WONT MEND NOTHING HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AS HE GATHERED UP ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY HAD CHOSEN TO CAST AWAY HE WAS NOT WILLING TO LEAVE THEM LYING OPEN IN THE WILDERNESS FOR ANY EYES TO SEE STINKER PICKED UP THAT ORCSHIRT SEEMINGLY AND HE ISNT GOING TO ADD A SWORD TO IT HIS HANDS ARE BAD ENOUGH WHEN EMPTY AND HE ISNT GOING TO MESS WITH MY PANS WITH THAT HE CARRIED ALL THE GEAR AWAY TO ONE OF THE MANY GAPING FISSURES THAT SCORED THE LAND AND THREW THEM IN THE CLATTER OF HIS PRECIOUS PANS AS THEY FELL DOWN INTO THE DARK WAS LIKE A DEATHKNELL TO HIS HEART
     HE CAME BACK TO FRODO AND THEN OF HIS ELVENROPE HE CUT A SHORT PIECE TO SERVE HIS MASTER AS A GIRDLE AND BIND THE GREY CLOAK CLOSE ABOUT HIS WAIST THE REST HE CAREFULLY COILED AND PUT BACK IN HIS PACK BESIDE THAT HE KEPT ONLY THE REMNANTS OF THEIR WAYBREAD AND THE WATERBOTTLE AND STING STILL HANGING BY HIS BELT AND HIDDEN AWAY IN A POCKET OF HIS TUNIC NEXT HIS BREAST THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL AND THE LITTLE BOX THAT SHE GAVE HIM FOR HIS OWN
     NOW AT LAST THEY TURNED THEIR FACES TO THE MOUNTAIN AND SET OUT THINKING NO MORE OF CONCEALMENT BENDING THEIR WEARINESS AND FAILING WILLS ONLY TO THE ONE TASK OF GOING ON IN THE DIMNESS OF ITS DREARY DAY FEW THINGS EVEN IN THAT LAND OF VIGILANCE COULD HAVE ESPIED THEM SAVE FROM CLOSE AT HAND OF ALL THE SLAVES OF THE DARK LORD ONLY THE NAZGOWER WAS TURNED
     THAT DAY IT SEEMED TO SAM THAT HIS MASTER HAD FOUND SOME NEW STRENGTH MORE THAN COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE SMALL LIGHTENING OF THE LOAD THAT HE HAD TO CARRY IN THE FIRST MARCHES THEY WENT FURTHER AND FASTER THAN HE HAD HOPED THE LAND WAS ROUGH AND HOSTILE AND YET THEY MADE MUCH PROGRESS AND EVER THE MOUNTAIN DREW NEARER BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON AND ALL TOO SOON THE DIM LIGHT BEGAN TO FAIL FRODO STOOPED AGAIN AND BEGAN TO STAGGER AS IF THE RENEWED EFFORT HAD SQUANDERED HIS REMAINING STRENGTH
     AT THEIR LAST HALT HE SANK DOWN AND SAID IM THIRSTY SAM AND DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN SAM GAVE HIM A MOUTHFUL OF WATER ONLY ONE MORE MOUTHFUL REMAINED HE WENT WITHOUT HIMSELF AND NOW AS ONCE MORE THE NIGHT OF MORDOR CLOSED OVER THEM THROUGH ALL HIS THOUGHTS THERE CAME THE MEMORY OF WATER AND EVERY BROOK OR STREAM OR FOUNT THAT HE HAD EVER SEEN UNDER GREEN WILLOWSHADES OR TWINKLING IN THE SUN DANCED AND RIPPLED FOR HIS TORMENT BEHIND THE BLINDNESS OF HIS EYES HE FELT THE COOL MUD ABOUT HIS TOES AS HE PADDLED IN THE POOL AT BYWATER WITH JOLLY COTTON AND TOM AND NIBS AND THEIR SISTER ROSIE BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE SIGHED AND FAR AWAY THE WAY BACK IF THERE IS ONE GOES PAST THE MOUNTAIN
     HE COULD NOT SLEEP AND HE HELD A DEBATE WITH HIMSELF WELL COME NOW WEVE DONE BETTER THAN YOU HOPED HE SAID STURDILY BEGAN WELL ANYWAY I RECKON WE CROSSED HALF THE DISTANCE BEFORE WE STOPPED ONE MORE DAY WILL DO IT AND THEN HE PAUSED
     DONT BE A FOOL SAM GAMGEE CAME AN ANSWER IN HIS OWN VOICE HE WONT GO ANOTHER DAY LIKE THAT IF HE MOVES AT ALL AND YOU CANT GO ON MUCH LONGER GIVING HIM ALL THE WATER AND MOST OF THE FOOD
     I CAN GO ON A GOOD WAY THOUGH AND I WILL
     WHERE TO
     TO THE MOUNTAIN OF COURSE
     BUT WHAT THEN SAM GAMGEE WHAT THEN WHEN YOU GET THERE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO HE WONT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIMSELF
     TO HIS DISMAY SAM REALIZED THAT HE HAD NOT GOT AN ANSWER TO THIS HE HAD NO CLEAR IDEA AT ALL FRODO HAD NOT SPOKEN MUCH TO HIM OF HIS ERRAND AND SAM ONLY KNEW VAGUELY THAT THE RING HAD SOMEHOW TO BE PUT INTO THE FIRE THE CRACKS OF DOOM HE MUTTERED THE OLD NAME RISING TO HIS MIND WELL IF MASTER KNOWS HOW TO FIND THEM I DONT
     THERE YOU ARE CAME THE ANSWER ITS ALL QUITE USELESS HE SAID SO HIMSELF YOU ARE THE FOOL GOING ON HOPING AND TOILING YOU COULD HAVE LAIN DOWN AND GONE TO SLEEP TOGETHER DAYS AGO IF YOU HADNT BEEN SO DOGGED BUT YOULL DIE JUST THE SAME OR WORSE YOU MIGHT JUST AS WELL LIE DOWN NOW AND GIVE IT UP YOULL NEVER GET TO THE TOP ANYWAY
     ILL GET THERE IF I LEAVE EVERYTHING BUT MY BONES BEHIND SAID SAM AND ILL CARRY MR FRODO UP MYSELF IF IT BREAKS MY BACK AND HEART SO STOP ARGUING
     AT THAT MOMENT SAM FELT A TREMOR IN THE GROUND BENEATH HIM AND HE HEARD OR SENSED A DEEP REMOTE RUMBLE AS OF THUNDER IMPRISONED UNDER THE EARTH THERE WAS A BRIEF RED FLAME THAT FLICKERED UNDER THE CLOUDS AND DIED AWAY THE MOUNTAIN TOO SLEPT UNEASILY
     THE LAST STAGE OF THEIR JOURNEY TO ORODRUIN CAME AND IT WAS A TORMENT GREATER THAN SAM HAD EVER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD BEAR HE WAS IN PAIN AND SO PARCHED THAT HE COULD NO LONGER SWALLOW EVEN A MOUTHFUL OF FOOD IT REMAINED DARK NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SMOKES OF THE MOUNTAIN THERE SEEMED TO BE A STORM COMING UP AND AWAY TO THE SOUTHEAST THERE WAS A SHIMMER OF LIGHTNINGS UNDER THE BLACK SKIES WORST OF ALL THE AIR WAS FULL OF FUMES BREATHING WAS PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT AND A DIZZINESS CAME ON THEM SO THAT THEY STAGGERED AND OFTEN FELL AND YET THEIR WILLS DID NOT YIELD AND THEY STRUGGLED ON
     THE MOUNTAIN CREPT UP EVER NEARER UNTIL IF THEY LIFTED THEIR HEAVY HEADS IT FILLED ALL THEIR SIGHT LOOMING VAST BEFORE THEM A HUGE MASS OF ASH AND SLAG AND BURNED STONE OUT OF WHICH A SHEERSIDED CONE WAS RAISED INTO THE CLOUDS BEFORE THE DAYLONG DUSK ENDED AND TRUE NIGHT CAME AGAIN THEY HAD CRAWLED AND STUMBLED TO ITS VERY FEET
     WITH A GASP FRODO CAST HIMSELF ON THE GROUND SAM SAT BY HIM TO HIS SURPRISE HE FELT TIRED BUT LIGHTER AND HIS HEAD SEEMED CLEAR AGAIN NO MORE DEBATES DISTURBED HIS MIND HE KNEW ALL THE ARGUMENTS OF DESPAIR AND WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THEM HIS WILL WAS SET AND ONLY DEATH WOULD BREAK IT HE FELT NO LONGER EITHER DESIRE OR NEED OF SLEEP BUT RATHER OF WATCHFULNESS HE KNEW THAT ALL THE HAZARDS AND PERILS WERE NOW DRAWING TOGETHER TO A POINT THE NEXT DAY WOULD BE A DAY OF DOOM THE DAY OF FINAL EFFORT OR DISASTER THE LAST GASP
     BUT WHEN WOULD IT COME THE NIGHT SEEMED ENDLESS AND TIMELESS MINUTE AFTER MINUTE FALLING DEAD AND ADDING UP TO NO PASSING HOUR BRINGING NO CHANGE SAM BEGAN TO WONDER IF A SECOND DARKNESS HAD BEGUN AND NO DAY WOULD EVER REAPPEAR AT LAST HE GROPED FOR FRODOS HAND IT WAS COLD AND TREMBLING HIS MASTER WAS SHIVERING
     I DIDNT OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT MY BLANKET BEHIND MUTTERED SAM AND LYING DOWN HE TRIED TO COMFORT FRODO WITH HIS ARMS AND BODY THEN SLEEP TOOK HIM AND THE DIM LIGHT OF THE LAST DAY OF THEIR QUEST FOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE THE WIND HAD FALLEN THE DAY BEFORE AS IT SHIFTED FROM THE WEST AND NOW IT CAME FROM THE NORTH AND BEGAN TO RISE AND SLOWLY THE LIGHT OF THE UNSEEN SUN FILTERED DOWN INTO THE SHADOWS WHERE THE HOBBITS LAY
     NOW FOR IT NOW FOR THE LAST GASP SAID SAM AS HE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET HE BENT OVER FRODO ROUSING HIM GENTLY FRODO GROANED BUT WITH A GREAT EFFORT OF WILL HE STAGGERED UP AND THEN HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES AGAIN HE RAISED HIS EYES WITH DIFFICULTY TO THE DARK SLOPES OF MOUNT DOOM TOWERING ABOVE HIM AND THEN PITIFULLY HE BEGAN TO CRAWL FORWARD ON HIS HANDS
     SAM LOOKED AT HIM AND WEPT IN HIS HEART BUT NO TEARS CAME TO HIS DRY AND STINGING EYES I SAID ID CARRY HIM IF IT BROKE MY BACK HE MUTTERED AND I WILL
     COME MR FRODO HE CRIED I CANT CARRY IT FOR YOU BUT I CAN CARRY YOU AND IT AS WELL SO UP YOU GET COME ON MR FRODO DEAR SAM WILL GIVE YOU A RIDE JUST TELL HIM WHERE TO GO AND HELL GO
     AS FRODO CLUNG UPON HIS BACK ARMS LOOSELY ABOUT HIS NECK LEGS CLASPED FIRMLY UNDER HIS ARMS SAM STAGGERED TO HIS FEET AND THEN TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE FELT THE BURDEN LIGHT HE HAD FEARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE BARELY STRENGTH TO LIFT HIS MASTER ALONE AND BEYOND THAT HE HAD EXPECTED TO SHARE IN THE DREADFUL DRAGGING WEIGHT OF THE ACCURSED RING BUT IT WAS NOT SO WHETHER BECAUSE FRODO WAS SO WORN BY HIS LONG PAINS WOUND OF KNIFE AND VENOMOUS STING AND SORROW FEAR AND HOMELESS WANDERING OR BECAUSE SOME GIFT OF FINAL STRENGTH WAS GIVEN TO HIM SAM LIFTED FRODO WITH NO MORE DIFFICULTY THAN IF HE WERE CARRYING A HOBBITCHILD PIGABACK IN SOME ROMP ON THE LAWNS OR HAYFIELDS OF THE SHIRE HE TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND STARTED OFF
     THEY HAD REACHED THE MOUNTAINS FOOT ON ITS NORTHERN SIDE AND A LITTLE TO THE WESTWARD THERE ITS LONG GREY SLOPES THOUGH BROKEN WERE NOT SHEER FRODO DID NOT SPEAK AND SO SAM STRUGGLED ON AS BEST HE COULD HAVING NO GUIDANCE BUT THE WILL TO CLIMB AS HIGH AS MIGHT BE BEFORE HIS STRENGTH GAVE OUT AND HIS WILL BROKE ON HE TOILED UP AND UP TURNING THIS WAY AND THAT TO LESSEN THE SLOPE OFTEN STUMBLING FORWARD AND AT THE LAST CRAWLING LIKE A SNAIL WITH A HEAVY BURDEN ON ITS BACK WHEN HIS WILL COULD DRIVE HIM NO FURTHER AND HIS LIMBS GAVE WAY HE STOPPED AND LAID HIS MASTER GENTLY DOWN
     FRODO OPENED HIS EYES AND DREW A BREATH IT WAS EASIER TO BREATHE UP HERE ABOVE THE REEKS THAT COILED AND DRIFTED DOWN BELOW THANK YOU SAM HE SAID IN A CRACKED WHISPER HOW FAR IS THERE TO GO
     I DONT KNOW SAID SAM BECAUSE I DONT KNOW WHERE WERE GOING
     HE LOOKED BACK AND THEN HE LOOKED UP AND HE WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW FAR HIS LAST EFFORT HAD BROUGHT HIM THE MOUNTAIN STANDING OMINOUS AND ALONE HAD LOOKED TALLER THAN IT WAS SAM SAW NOW THAT IT WAS LESS LOFTY THAN THE HIGH PASSES OF THE EPHEL DUATH WHICH HE AND FRODO HAD SCALED THE CONFUSED AND TUMBLED SHOULDERS OF ITS GREAT BASE ROSE FOR MAYBE THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE PLAIN AND ABOVE THEM WAS REARED HALF AS HIGH AGAIN ITS TALL CENTRAL CONE LIKE A VAST OAST OR CHIMNEY CAPPED WITH A JAGGED CRATER BUT ALREADY SAM WAS MORE THAN HALF WAY UP THE BASE AND THE PLAIN OF GORGOROTH WAS DIM BELOW HIM WRAPPED IN FUME AND SHADOW AS HE LOOKED UP HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A SHOUT IF HIS PARCHED THROAT HAD ALLOWED HIM FOR AMID THE RUGGED HUMPS AND SHOULDERS ABOVE HIM HE SAW PLAINLY A PATH OR ROAD IT CLIMBED LIKE A RISING GIRDLE FROM THE WEST AND WOUND SNAKELIKE ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN UNTIL BEFORE IT WENT ROUND OUT OF VIEW IT REACHED THE FOOT OF THE CONE UPON ITS EASTERN SIDE
     
     SAM COULD NOT SEE THE COURSE IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HIM WHERE IT WAS LOWEST FOR A STEEP SLOPE WENT UP FROM WHERE HE STOOD BUT HE GUESSED THAT IF HE COULD ONLY STRUGGLE ON JUST A LITTLE WAY FURTHER UP THEY WOULD STRIKE THIS PATH A GLEAM OF HOPE RETURNED TO HIM THEY MIGHT CONQUER THE MOUNTAIN YET WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT THERE APURPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF IT WASNT THERE ID HAVE TO SAY I WAS BEATEN IN THE END
     THE PATH WAS NOT PUT THERE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SAM HE DID NOT KNOW IT BUT HE WAS LOOKING AT SAURONS ROAD FROM BARADDUR TO THE SAMMATH NAUR THE CHAMBERS OF FIRE OUT FROM THE DARK TOWERS HUGE WESTERN GATE IT CAME OVER A DEEP ABYSS BY A VAST BRIDGE OF IRON AND THEN PASSING INTO THE PLAIN IT RAN FOR A LEAGUE BETWEEN TWO SMOKING CHASMS AND SO REACHED A LONG SLOPING CAUSEWAY THAT LED UP ON TO THE MOUNTAINS EASTERN SIDE THENCE TURNING AND ENCIRCLING ALL ITS WIDE GIRTH FROM SOUTH TO NORTH IT CLIMBED AT LAST HIGH IN THE UPPER CONE BUT STILL FAR FROM THE REEKING SUMMIT TO A DARK ENTRANCE THAT GAZED BACK EAST STRAIGHT TO THE WINDOW OF THE EYE IN SAURONS SHADOWMANTLED FORTRESS OFTEN BLOCKED OR DESTROYED BY THE TUMULTS OF THE MOUNTAINS FURNACES ALWAYS THAT ROAD WAS REPAIRED AND CLEANED AGAIN BY THE LABOURS OF COUNTLESS ORCS
     SAM DREW A DEEP BREATH THERE WAS A PATH BUT HOW HE WAS TO GET UP THE SLOPE TO IT HE DID NOT KNOW FIRST HE MUST EASE HIS ACHING BACK HE LAY FLAT BESIDE FRODO FOR A WHILE NEITHER SPOKE SLOWLY THE LIGHT GREW SUDDENLY A SENSE OF URGENCY WHICH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND CAME TO SAM IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED NOW NOW OR IT WILL BE TOO LATE HE BRACED HIMSELF AND GOT UP FRODO ALSO SEEMED TO HAVE FELT THE CALL HE STRUGGLED TO HIS KNEES
     ILL CRAWL SAM HE GASPED
     SO FOOT BY FOOT LIKE SMALL GREY INSECTS THEY CREPT UP THE SLOPE THEY CAME TO THE PATH AND FOUND THAT IT WAS BROAD PAVED WITH BROKEN RUBBLE AND BEATEN ASH FRODO CLAMBERED ON TO IT AND THEN MOVED AS IF BY SOME COMPULSION HE TURNED SLOWLY TO FACE THE EAST FAR OFF THE SHADOWS OF SAURON HUNG BUT TORN BY SOME GUST OF WIND OUT OF THE WORLD OR ELSE MOVED BY SOME GREAT DISQUIET WITHIN THE MANTLING CLOUDS SWIRLED AND FOR A MOMENT DREW ASIDE AND THEN HE SAW RISING BLACK BLACKER AND DARKER THAN THE VAST SHADES AMID WHICH IT STOOD THE CRUEL PINNACLES AND IRON CROWN OF THE TOPMOST TOWER OF BARADDUR ONE MOMENT ONLY IT STARED OUT BUT AS FROM SOME GREAT WINDOW IMMEASURABLY HIGH THERE STABBED NORTHWARD A FLAME OF RED THE FLICKER OF A PIERCING EYE AND THEN THE SHADOWS WERE FURLED AGAIN AND THE TERRIBLE VISION WAS REMOVED THE EYE WAS NOT TURNED TO THEM IT WAS GAZING NORTH TO WHERE THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST STOOD AT BAY AND THITHER ALL ITS MALICE WAS NOW BENT AS THE POWER MOVED TO STRIKE ITS DEADLY BLOW BUT FRODO AT THAT DREADFUL GLIMPSE FELL AS ONE STRICKEN MORTALLY HIS HAND SOUGHT THE CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK

     AGAIN HE LIFTED FRODO AND DREW HIS HANDS DOWN TO HIS OWN BREAST LETTING HIS MASTERS LEGS DANGLE THEN HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND STRUGGLED OFF ALONG THE CLIMBING ROAD IT WAS NOT AS EASY A WAY TO TAKE AS IT HAD LOOKED AT FIRST BY FORTUNE THE FIRES THAT HAD POURED FORTH IN THE GREAT TURMOILS WHEN SAM STOOD UPON CIRITH UNGOL HAD FLOWED DOWN MAINLY ON THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SLOPES AND THE ROAD ON THIS SIDE WAS NOT BLOCKED YET IN MANY PLACES IT HAD CRUMBLED AWAY OR WAS CROSSED BY GAPING RENTS AFTER CLIMBING EASTWARD FOR SOME TIME IT BENT BACK UPON ITSELF AT A SHARP ANGLE AND WENT WESTWARD FOR A SPACE THERE AT THE BEND IT WAS CUT DEEP THROUGH A CRAG OF OLD WEATHERED STONE ONCE LONG AGO VOMITED FROM THE MOUNTAINS FURNACES PANTING UNDER HIS LOAD SAM TURNED THE BEND AND EVEN AS HE DID SO OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE HAD A GLIMPSE OF SOMETHING FALLING FROM THE CRAG LIKE A SMALL PIECE OF BLACK STONE THAT HAD TOPPLED OFF AS HE PASSED
     A SUDDEN WEIGHT SMOTE HIM AND HE CRASHED FORWARD TEARING THE BACKS OF HIS HANDS THAT STILL CLASPED HIS MASTERS THEN HE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED FOR ABOVE HIM AS HE LAY HE HEARD A HATED VOICE
     WICKED MASSTER IT HISSED WICKED MASSTER CHEATS US CHEATS SMGOLLUM HE MUSSTNT GO THAT WAY HE MUSSTNT HURT PRECIOUSS GIVE IT TO SM
     WITH A VIOLENT HEAVE SAM ROSE UP AT ONCE HE DREW HIS SWORD BUT HE COULD DO NOTHING GOLLUM AND FRODO WERE LOCKED TOGETHER GOLLUM WAS TEARING AT HIS MASTER TRYING TO GET AT THE CHAIN AND THE RING THIS WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAVE ROUSED THE DYING EMBERS OF FRODOS HEART AND WILL AN ATTACK AN ATTEMPT TO WREST HIS TREASURE FROM HIM BY FORCE HE FOUGHT BACK WITH A SUDDEN FURY THAT AMAZED SAM AND GOLLUM ALSO EVEN SO THINGS MIGHT HAVE GONE FAR OTHERWISE IF GOLLUM HIMSELF HAD REMAINED UNCHANGED BUT WHATEVER DREADFUL PATHS LONELY AND HUNGRY AND WATERLESS HE HAD TRODDEN DRIVEN BY A DEVOURING DESIRE AND A TERRIBLE FEAR THEY HAD LEFT GRIEVOUS MARKS ON HIM HE WAS A LEAN STARVED HAGGARD THING ALL BONES AND TIGHTDRAWN SALLOW SKIN A WILD LIGHT FLAMED IN HIS EYES BUT HIS MALICE WAS NO LONGER MATCHED BY HIS OLD GRIPING STRENGTH FRODO FLUNG HIM OFF AND ROSE UP QUIVERING
     DOWN DOWN HE GASPED CLUTCHING HIS HAND TO HIS BREAST SO THAT BENEATH THE COVER OF HIS LEATHER SHIRT HE CLASPED THE RING DOWN YOU CREEPING THING AND OUT OF MY PATH YOUR TIME IS AT AN END YOU CANNOT BETRAY ME OR SLAY ME NOW
     THEN SUDDENLY AS BEFORE UNDER THE EAVES OF THE EMYN MUIL SAM SAW THESE TWO RIVALS WITH OTHER VISION A CROUCHING SHAPE SCARCELY MORE THAN THE SHADOW OF A LIVING THING A CREATURE NOW WHOLLY RUINED AND DEFEATED YET FILLED WITH A HIDEOUS LUST AND RAGE AND BEFORE IT STOOD STERN UNTOUCHABLE NOW BY PITY A FIGURE ROBED IN WHITE BUT AT ITS BREAST IT HELD A WHEEL OF FIRE OUT OF THE FIRE THERE SPOKE A COMMANDING VOICE
     BEGONE AND TROUBLE ME NO MORE IF YOU TOUCH ME EVER AGAIN YOU SHALL BE CAST YOURSELF INTO THE FIRE OF DOOM
     THE CROUCHING SHAPE BACKED AWAY TERROR IN ITS BLINKING EYES AND YET AT THE SAME TIME INSATIABLE DESIRE
     THEN THE VISION PASSED AND SAM SAW FRODO STANDING HAND ON BREAST HIS BREATH COMING IN GREAT GASPS AND GOLLUM AT HIS FEET RESTING ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS WIDESPLAYED HANDS UPON THE GROUND
     LOOK OUT CRIED SAM HELL SPRING HE STEPPED FORWARD BRANDISHING HIS SWORD QUICK MASTER HE GASPED GO ON GO ON NO TIME TO LOSE ILL DEAL WITH HIM GO ON
     FRODO LOOKED AT HIM AS IF AT ONE NOW FAR AWAY YES I MUST GO ON HE SAID FAREWELL SAM THIS IS THE END AT LAST ON MOUNT DOOM DOOM SHALL FALL FAREWELL HE TURNED AND WENT ON WALKING SLOWLY BUT ERECT UP THE CLIMBING PATH
     NOW SAID SAM AT LAST I CAN DEAL WITH YOU HE LEAPED FORWARD WITH DRAWN BLADE READY FOR BATTLE BUT GOLLUM DID NOT SPRING HE FELL FLAT UPON THE GROUND AND WHIMPERED
     DONT KILL US HE WEPT DONT HURT US WITH NASSTY CRUEL STEEL LET US LIVE YES LIVE JUST A LITTLE LONGER LOST LOST WERE LOST AND WHEN PRECIOUS GOES WELL DIE YES DIE INTO THE DUST HE CLAWED UP THE ASHES OF THE PATH WITH HIS LONG FLESHLESS FINGERS DUSST HE HISSED
     SAMS HAND WAVERED HIS MIND WAS HOT WITH WRATH AND THE MEMORY OF EVIL IT WOULD BE JUST TO SLAY THIS TREACHEROUS MURDEROUS CREATURE JUST AND MANY TIMES DESERVED AND ALSO IT SEEMED THE ONLY SAFE THING TO DO BUT DEEP IN HIS HEART THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT RESTRAINED HIM HE COULD NOT STRIKE THIS THING LYING IN THE DUST FORLORN RUINOUS UTTERLY WRETCHED HE HIMSELF THOUGH ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE HAD BORNE THE RING AND NOW DIMLY HE GUESSED THE AGONY OF GOLLUMS SHRIVELLED MIND AND BODY ENSLAVED TO THAT RING UNABLE TO FIND PEACE OR RELIEF EVER IN LIFE AGAIN BUT SAM HAD NO WORDS TO EXPRESS WHAT HE FELT
     OH CURSE YOU YOU STINKING THING HE SAID GO AWAY BE OFF I DONT TRUST YOU NOT AS FAR AS I COULD KICK YOU BUT BE OFF OR I SHALL HURT YOU YES WITH NASTY CRUEL STEEL
     GOLLUM GOT UP ON ALL FOURS AND BACKED AWAY FOR SEVERAL PACES AND THEN HE TURNED AND AS SAM AIMED A KICK AT HIM HE FLED AWAY DOWN THE PATH SAM GAVE NO MORE HEED TO HIM HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED HIS MASTER HE LOOKED UP THE PATH AND COULD NOT SEE HIM AS FAST AS HE COULD HE TRUDGED UP THE ROAD IF HE HAD LOOKED BACK HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN NOT FAR BELOW GOLLUM TURN AGAIN AND THEN WITH A WILD LIGHT OF MADNESS GLARING IN HIS EYES COME SWIFTLY BUT WARILY CREEPING ON BEHIND A SLINKING SHADOW AMONG THE STONES
     THE PATH CLIMBED ON SOON IT BENT AGAIN AND WITH A LAST EASTWARD COURSE PASSED IN A CUTTING ALONG THE FACE OF THE CONE AND CAME TO THE DARK DOOR IN THE MOUNTAINS SIDE THE DOOR OF THE SAMMATH NAUR FAR AWAY NOW RISING TOWARDS THE SOUTH THE SUN PIERCING THE SMOKES AND HAZE BURNED OMINOUS A DULL BLEARED DISC OF RED BUT ALL MORDOR LAY ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN LIKE A DEAD LAND SILENT SHADOWFOLDED WAITING FOR SOME DREADFUL STROKE
     SAM CAME TO THE GAPING MOUTH AND PEERED IN IT WAS DARK AND HOT AND A DEEP RUMBLING SHOOK THE AIR FRODO MASTER HE CALLED THERE WAS NO ANSWER FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD HIS HEART BEATING WITH WILD FEARS AND THEN HE PLUNGED IN A SHADOW FOLLOWED HIM
     AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING IN HIS GREAT NEED HE DREW OUT ONCE MORE THE PHIAL OF GALADRIEL BUT IT WAS PALE AND COLD IN HIS TREMBLING HAND AND THREW NO LIGHT INTO THAT STIFLING DARK HE WAS COME TO THE HEART OF THE REALM OF SAURON AND THE FORGES OF HIS ANCIENT MIGHT GREATEST IN MIDDLEEARTH ALL OTHER POWERS WERE HERE SUBDUED FEARFULLY HE TOOK A FEW UNCERTAIN STEPS IN THE DARK AND THEN ALL AT ONCE THERE CAME A FLASH OF RED THAT LEAPED UPWARD AND SMOTE THE HIGH BLACK ROOF THEN SAM SAW THAT HE WAS IN A LONG CAVE OR TUNNEL THAT BORED INTO THE MOUNTAINS SMOKING CONE BUT ONLY A SHORT WAY AHEAD ITS FLOOR AND THE WALLS ON EITHER SIDE WERE CLOVEN BY A GREAT FISSURE OUT OF WHICH THE RED GLARE CAME NOW LEAPING UP NOW DYING DOWN INTO DARKNESS AND ALL THE WHILE FAR BELOW THERE WAS A RUMOUR AND A TROUBLE AS OF GREAT ENGINES THROBBING AND LABOURING
     THE LIGHT SPRANG UP AGAIN AND THERE ON THE BRINK OF THE CHASM AT THE VERY CRACK OF DOOM STOOD FRODO BLACK AGAINST THE GLARE TENSE ERECT BUT STILL AS IF HE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE
     MASTER CRIED SAM
     THEN FRODO STIRRED AND SPOKE WITH A CLEAR VOICE INDEED WITH A VOICE CLEARER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN SAM HAD EVER HEARD HIM USE AND IT ROSE ABOVE THE THROB AND TURMOIL OF MOUNT DOOM RINGING IN THE ROOF AND WALLS
     I HAVE COME HE SAID BUT I DO NOT CHOOSE NOW TO DO WHAT I CAME TO DO I WILL NOT DO THIS DEED THE RING IS MINE AND SUDDENLY AS HE SET IT ON HIS FINGER HE VANISHED FROM SAMS SIGHT SAM GASPED BUT HE HAD NO CHANCE TO CRY OUT FOR AT THAT MOMENT MANY THINGS HAPPENED
     SOMETHING STRUCK SAM VIOLENTLY IN THE BACK HIS LEGS WERE KNOCKED FROM UNDER HIM AND HE WAS FLUNG ASIDE STRIKING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE STONY FLOOR AS A DARK SHAPE SPRANG OVER HIM HE LAY STILL AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WENT BLACK
     AND FAR AWAY AS FRODO PUT ON THE RING AND CLAIMED IT FOR HIS OWN EVEN IN SAMMATH NAUR THE VERY HEART OF HIS REALM THE POWER IN BARADDUR WAS SHAKEN AND THE TOWER TREMBLED FROM ITS FOUNDATIONS TO ITS PROUD AND BITTER CROWN THE DARK LORD WAS SUDDENLY AWARE OF HIM AND HIS EYE PIERCING ALL SHADOWS LOOKED ACROSS THE PLAIN TO THE DOOR THAT HE HAD MADE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS OWN FOLLY WAS REVEALED TO HIM IN A BLINDING FLASH AND ALL THE DEVICES OF HIS ENEMIES WERE AT LAST LAID BARE THEN HIS WRATH BLAZED IN CONSUMING FLAME BUT HIS FEAR ROSE LIKE A VAST BLACK SMOKE TO CHOKE HIM FOR HE KNEW HIS DEADLY PERIL AND THE THREAD UPON WHICH HIS DOOM NOW HUNG
     FROM ALL HIS POLICIES AND WEBS OF FEAR AND TREACHERY FROM ALL HIS STRATAGEMS AND WARS HIS MIND SHOOK FREE AND THROUGHOUT HIS REALM A TREMOR RAN HIS SLAVES QUAILED AND HIS ARMIES HALTED AND HIS CAPTAINS SUDDENLY STEERLESS BEREFT OF WILL WAVERED AND DESPAIRED FOR THEY WERE FORGOTTEN THE WHOLE MIND AND PURPOSE OF THE POWER THAT WIELDED THEM WAS NOW BENT WITH OVERWHELMING FORCE UPON THE MOUNTAIN AT HIS SUMMONS WHEELING WITH A RENDING CRY IN A LAST DESPERATE RACE THERE FLEW FASTER THAN THE WINDS THE NAZG
     SAM GOT UP HE WAS DAZED AND BLOOD STREAMING FROM HIS HEAD DRIPPED IN HIS EYES HE GROPED FORWARD AND THEN HE SAW A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE THING GOLLUM ON THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS WAS FIGHTING LIKE A MAD THING WITH AN UNSEEN FOE TO AND FRO HE SWAYED NOW SO NEAR THE BRINK THAT ALMOST HE TUMBLED IN NOW DRAGGING BACK FALLING TO THE GROUND RISING AND FALLING AGAIN AND ALL THE WHILE HE HISSED BUT SPOKE NO WORDS
     THE FIRES BELOW AWOKE IN ANGER THE RED LIGHT BLAZED AND ALL THE CAVERN WAS FILLED WITH A GREAT GLARE AND HEAT SUDDENLY SAM SAW GOLLUMS LONG HANDS DRAW UPWARDS TO HIS MOUTH HIS WHITE FANGS GLEAMED AND THEN SNAPPED AS THEY BIT FRODO GAVE A CRY AND THERE HE WAS FALLEN UPON HIS KNEES AT THE CHASMS EDGE BUT GOLLUM DANCING LIKE A MAD THING HELD ALOFT THE RING A FINGER STILL THRUST WITHIN ITS CIRCLE IT SHONE NOW AS IF VERILY IT WAS WROUGHT OF LIVING FIRE
     PRECIOUS PRECIOUS PRECIOUS GOLLUM CRIED MY PRECIOUS O MY PRECIOUS AND WITH THAT EVEN AS HIS EYES WERE LIFTED UP TO GLOAT ON HIS PRIZE HE STEPPED TOO FAR TOPPLED WAVERED FOR A MOMENT ON THE BRINK AND THEN WITH A SHRIEK HE FELL OUT OF THE DEPTHS CAME HIS LAST WAIL PRECIOUS AND HE WAS GONE
     THERE WAS A ROAR AND A GREAT CONFUSION OF NOISE FIRES LEAPED UP AND LICKED THE ROOF THE THROBBING GREW TO A GREAT TUMULT AND THE MOUNTAIN SHOOK SAM RAN TO FRODO AND PICKED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM OUT TO THE DOOR AND THERE UPON THE DARK THRESHOLD OF THE SAMMATH NAUR HIGH ABOVE THE PLAINS OF MORDOR SUCH WONDER AND TERROR CAME ON HIM THAT HE STOOD STILL FORGETTING ALL ELSE AND GAZED AS ONE TURNED TO STONE
     A BRIEF VISION HE HAD OF SWIRLING CLOUD AND IN THE MIDST OF IT TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS TALL AS HILLS FOUNDED UPON A MIGHTY MOUNTAINTHRONE ABOVE IMMEASURABLE PITS GREAT COURTS AND DUNGEONS EYELESS PRISONS SHEER AS CLIFFS AND GAPING GATES OF STEEL AND ADAMANT AND THEN ALL PASSED TOWERS FELL AND MOUNTAINS SLID WALLS CRUMBLED AND MELTED CRASHING DOWN VAST SPIRES OF SMOKE AND SPOUTING STEAMS WENT BILLOWING UP UP UNTIL THEY TOPPLED LIKE AN OVERWHELMING WAVE AND ITS WILD CREST CURLED AND CAME FOAMING DOWN UPON THE LAND AND THEN AT LAST OVER THE MILES BETWEEN THERE CAME A RUMBLE RISING TO A DEAFENING CRASH AND ROAR THE EARTH SHOOK THE PLAIN HEAVED AND CRACKED AND ORODRUIN REELED FIRE BELCHED FROM ITS RIVEN SUMMIT THE SKIES BURST INTO THUNDER SEARED WITH LIGHTNING DOWN LIKE LASHING WHIPS FELL A TORRENT OF BLACK RAIN AND INTO THE HEART OF THE STORM WITH A CRY THAT PIERCED ALL OTHER SOUNDS TEARING THE CLOUDS ASUNDER THE NAZG
     WELL THIS IS THE END SAM GAMGEE SAID A VOICE BY HIS SIDE AND THERE WAS FRODO PALE AND WORN AND YET HIMSELF AGAIN AND IN HIS EYES THERE WAS PEACE NOW NEITHER STRAIN OF WILL NOR MADNESS NOR ANY FEAR HIS BURDEN WAS TAKEN AWAY THERE WAS THE DEAR MASTER OF THE SWEET DAYS IN THE SHIRE
     MASTER CRIED SAM AND FELL UPON HIS KNEES IN ALL THAT RUIN OF THE WORLD FOR THE MOMENT HE FELT ONLY JOY GREAT JOY THE BURDEN WAS GONE HIS MASTER HAD BEEN SAVED HE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN HE WAS FREE AND THEN SAM CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE MAIMED AND BLEEDING HAND

      CHAPTER 4
      THE FIELD OF CORMALLEN
     

     ALL ABOUT THE HILLS THE HOSTS OF MORDOR RAGED THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST WERE FOUNDERING IN A GATHERING SEA THE SUN GLEAMED RED AND UNDER THE WINGS OF THE NAZGNO SHADOW FELL ON HIM THE ONSLAUGHT OF MORDOR BROKE LIKE A WAVE ON THE BELEAGUERED HILLS VOICES ROARING LIKE A TIDE AMID THE WRECK AND CRASH OF ARMS
     AS IF TO HIS EYES SOME SUDDEN VISION HAD BEEN GIVEN GANDALF STIRRED AND HE TURNED LOOKING BACK NORTH WHERE THE SKIES WERE PALE AND CLEAR THEN HE LIFTED UP HIS HANDS AND CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE RINGING ABOVE THE DIN THE EAGLES ARE COMING AND MANY VOICES ANSWERED CRYING THE EAGLES ARE COMING THE EAGLES ARE COMING THE HOSTS OF MORDOR LOOKED UP AND WONDERED WHAT THIS SIGN MIGHT MEAN
     THERE CAME GWAIHIR THE WINDLORD AND LANDROVAL HIS BROTHER GREATEST OF ALL THE EAGLES OF THE NORTH MIGHTIEST OF THE DESCENDANTS OF OLD THORONDOR WHO BUILT HIS EYRIES IN THE INACCESSIBLE PEAKS OF THE ENCIRCLING MOUNTAINS WHEN MIDDLEEARTH WAS YOUNG BEHIND THEM IN LONG SWIFT LINES CAME ALL THEIR VASSALS FROM THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS SPEEDING ON A GATHERING WIND STRAIGHT DOWN UPON THE NAZG
     BUT THE NAZG FILLED THEM WITH HATE AND FURY WAS WAVERING ITS WILL WAS REMOVED FROM THEM AND NOW LOOKING IN THE EYES OF THEIR ENEMIES THEY SAW A DEADLY LIGHT AND WERE AFRAID
     THEN ALL THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST CRIED ALOUD FOR THEIR HEARTS WERE FILLED WITH A NEW HOPE IN THE MIDST OF DARKNESS OUT FROM THE BELEAGUERED HILLS KNIGHTS OF GONDOR RIDERS OF ROHAN DUNEDAIN OF THE NORTH CLOSESERRIED COMPANIES DROVE AGAINST THEIR WAVERING FOES PIERCING THE PRESS WITH THE THRUST OF BITTER SPEARS BUT GANDALF LIFTED UP HIS ARMS AND CALLED ONCE MORE IN A CLEAR VOICE
     STAND MEN OF THE WEST STAND AND WAIT THIS IS THE HOUR OF DOOM
     AND EVEN AS HE SPOKE THE EARTH ROCKED BENEATH THEIR FEET THEN RISING SWIFTLY UP FAR ABOVE THE TOWERS OF THE BLACK GATE HIGH ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS A VAST SOARING DARKNESS SPRANG INTO THE SKY FLICKERING WITH FIRE THE EARTH GROANED AND QUAKED THE TOWERS OF THE TEETH SWAYED TOTTERED AND FELL DOWN THE MIGHTY RAMPART CRUMBLED THE BLACK GATE WAS HURLED IN RUIN AND FROM FAR AWAY NOW DIM NOW GROWING NOW MOUNTING TO THE CLOUDS THERE CAME A DRUMMING RUMBLE A ROAR A LONG ECHOING ROLL OF RUINOUS NOISE
     THE REALM OF SAURON IS ENDED SAID GANDALF THE RINGBEARER HAS FULFILLED HIS QUEST AND AS THE CAPTAINS GAZED SOUTH TO THE LAND OF MORDOR IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT BLACK AGAINST THE PALL OF CLOUD THERE ROSE A HUGE SHAPE OF SHADOW IMPENETRABLE LIGHTNINGCROWNED FILLING ALL THE SKY ENORMOUS IT REARED ABOVE THE WORLD AND STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS THEM A VAST THREATENING HAND TERRIBLE BUT IMPOTENT FOR EVEN AS IT LEANED OVER THEM A GREAT WIND TOOK IT AND IT WAS ALL BLOWN AWAY AND PASSED AND THEN A HUSH FELL
     THE CAPTAINS BOWED THEIR HEADS AND WHEN THEY LOOKED UP AGAIN BEHOLD THEIR ENEMIES WERE FLYING AND THE POWER OF MORDOR WAS SCATTERING LIKE DUST IN THE WIND AS WHEN DEATH SMITES THE SWOLLEN BROODING THING THAT INHABITS THEIR CRAWLING HILL AND HOLDS THEM ALL IN SWAY ANTS WILL WANDER WITLESS AND PURPOSELESS AND THEN FEEBLY DIE SO THE CREATURES OF SAURON ORC OR TROLL OR BEAST SPELLENSLAVED RAN HITHER AND THITHER MINDLESS AND SOME SLEW THEMSELVES OR CAST THEMSELVES IN PITS OR FLED WAILING BACK TO HIDE IN HOLES AND DARK LIGHTLESS PLACES FAR FROM HOPE BUT THE MEN OF RHUN AND OF HARAD EASTERLING AND SOUTHRON SAW THE RUIN OF THEIR WAR AND THE GREAT MAJESTY AND GLORY OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST AND THOSE THAT WERE DEEPEST AND LONGEST IN EVIL SERVITUDE HATING THE WEST AND YET WERE MEN PROUD AND BOLD IN THEIR TURN NOW GATHERED THEMSELVES FOR A LAST STAND OF DESPERATE BATTLE BUT THE MOST PART FLED EASTWARD AS THEY COULD AND SOME CAST THEIR WEAPONS DOWN AND SUED FOR MERCY
     THEN GANDALF LEAVING ALL SUCH MATTERS OF BATTLE AND COMMAND TO ARAGORN AND THE OTHER LORDS STOOD UPON THE HILLTOP AND CALLED AND DOWN TO HIM CAME THE GREAT EAGLE GWAIHIR THE WINDLORD AND STOOD BEFORE HIM
     TWICE YOU HAVE BORNE ME GWAIHIR MY FRIEND SAID GANDALF THRICE SHALL PAY FOR ALL IF YOU ARE WILLING YOU WILL NOT FIND ME A BURDEN MUCH GREATER THAN WHEN YOU BORE ME FROM ZIRAKZIGIL WHERE MY OLD LIFE BURNED AWAY

     THEN COME AND LET YOUR BROTHER GO WITH US AND SOME OTHER OF YOUR FOLK WHO IS MOST SWIFT FOR WE HAVE NEED OF SPEED GREATER THAN ANY WIND OUTMATCHING THE WINGS OF THE NAZG
     THE NORTH WIND BLOWS BUT WE SHALL OUTFLY IT SAID GWAIHIR AND HE LIFTED UP GANDALF AND SPED AWAY SOUTH AND WITH HIM WENT LANDROVAL AND MENELDOR YOUNG AND SWIFT AND THEY PASSED OVER UDUN AND GORGOROTH AND SAW ALL THE LAND IN RUIN AND TUMULT BENEATH THEM AND BEFORE THEM MOUNT DOOM BLAZING POURING OUT ITS FIRE
     I AM GLAD THAT YOU ARE HERE WITH ME SAID FRODO HERE AT THE END OF ALL THINGS SAM
     YES I AM WITH YOU MASTER SAID SAM LAYING FRODOS WOUNDED HAND GENTLY TO HIS BREAST AND YOURE WITH ME AND THE JOURNEYS FINISHED BUT AFTER COMING ALL THAT WAY I DONT WANT TO GIVE UP YET ITS NOT LIKE ME SOMEHOW IF YOU UNDERSTAND
     MAYBE NOT SAM SAID FRODO BUT ITS LIKE THINGS ARE IN THE WORLD HOPES FAIL AN END COMES WE HAVE ONLY A LITTLE TIME TO WAIT NOW WE ARE LOST IN RUIN AND DOWNFALL AND THERE IS NO ESCAPE
     WELL MASTER WE COULD AT LEAST GO FURTHER FROM THIS DANGEROUS PLACE HERE FROM THIS CRACK OF DOOM IF THATS ITS NAME NOW COULDNT WE COME MR FRODO LETS GO DOWN THE PATH AT ANY RATE
     VERY WELL SAM IF YOU WISH TO GO ILL COME SAID FRODO AND THEY ROSE AND WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE WINDING ROAD AND EVEN AS THEY PASSED TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS QUAKING FEET A GREAT SMOKE AND STEAM BELCHED FROM THE SAMMATH NAUR AND THE SIDE OF THE CONE WAS RIVEN OPEN AND A HUGE FIERY VOMIT ROLLED IN SLOW THUNDEROUS CASCADE DOWN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINSIDE
     FRODO AND SAM COULD GO NO FURTHER THEIR LAST STRENGTH OF MIND AND BODY WAS SWIFTLY EBBING THEY HAD REACHED A LOW ASHEN HILL PILED AT THE MOUNTAINS FOOT BUT FROM IT THERE WAS NO MORE ESCAPE IT WAS AN ISLAND NOW NOT LONG TO ENDURE AMID THE TORMENT OF ORODRUIN ALL ABOUT IT THE EARTH GAPED AND FROM DEEP RIFTS AND PITS SMOKE AND FUMES LEAPED UP BEHIND THEM THE MOUNTAIN WAS CONVULSED GREAT RENTS OPENED IN ITS SIDE SLOW RIVERS OF FIRE CAME DOWN THE LONG SLOPES TOWARDS THEM SOON THEY WOULD BE ENGULFED A RAIN OF HOT ASH WAS FALLING
     THEY STOOD NOW AND SAM STILL HOLDING HIS MASTERS HAND CARESSED IT HE SIGHED WHAT A TALE WE HAVE BEEN IN MR FRODO HAVENT WE HE SAID I WISH I COULD HEAR IT TOLD DO YOU THINK THEYLL SAY NOW COMES THE STORY OF NINEFINGERED FRODO AND THE RING OF DOOM AND THEN EVERYONE WILL HUSH LIKE WE DID WHEN IN RIVENDELL THEY TOLD US THE TALE OF BEREN ONEHAND AND THE GREAT JEWEL I WISH I COULD HEAR IT AND I WONDER HOW IT WILL GO ON AFTER OUR PART
     BUT EVEN WHILE HE SPOKE SO TO KEEP FEAR AWAY UNTIL THE VERY LAST HIS EYES STILL STRAYED NORTH NORTH INTO THE EYE OF THE WIND TO WHERE THE SKY FAR OFF WAS CLEAR AS THE COLD BLAST RISING TO A GALE DROVE BACK THE DARKNESS AND THE RUIN OF THE CLOUDS
     AND SO IT WAS THAT GWAIHIR SAW THEM WITH HIS KEEN FARSEEING EYES AS DOWN THE WILD WIND HE CAME AND DARING THE GREAT PERIL OF THE SKIES HE CIRCLED IN THE AIR TWO SMALL DARK FIGURES FORLORN HAND IN HAND UPON A LITTLE HILL WHILE THE WORLD SHOOK UNDER THEM AND GASPED AND RIVERS OF FIRE DREW NEAR AND EVEN AS HE ESPIED THEM AND CAME SWOOPING DOWN HE SAW THEM FALL WORN OUT OR CHOKED WITH FUMES AND HEAT OR STRICKEN DOWN BY DESPAIR AT LAST HIDING THEIR EYES FROM DEATH
     SIDE BY SIDE THEY LAY AND DOWN SWEPT GWAIHIR AND DOWN CAME LANDROVAL AND MENELDOR THE SWIFT AND IN A DREAM NOT KNOWING WHAT FATE HAD BEFALLEN THEM THE WANDERERS WERE LIFTED UP AND BORNE FAR AWAY OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND THE FIRE
     WHEN SAM AWOKE HE FOUND THAT HE WAS LYING ON SOME SOFT BED BUT OVER HIM GENTLY SWAYED WIDE BEECHEN BOUGHS AND THROUGH THEIR YOUNG LEAVES SUNLIGHT GLIMMERED GREEN AND GOLD ALL THE AIR WAS FULL OF A SWEET MINGLED SCENT
     HE REMEMBERED THAT SMELL THE FRAGRANCE OF ITHILIEN BLESS ME HE MUSED HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP FOR THE SCENT HAD BORNE HIM BACK TO THE DAY WHEN HE HAD LIT HIS LITTLE FIRE UNDER THE SUNNY BANK AND FOR A MOMENT ALL ELSE BETWEEN WAS OUT OF WAKING MEMORY HE STRETCHED AND DREW A DEEP BREATH WHY WHAT A DREAM IVE HAD HE MUTTERED I AM GLAD TO WAKE HE SAT UP AND THEN HE SAW THAT FRODO WAS LYING BESIDE HIM AND SLEPT PEACEFULLY ONE HAND BEHIND HIS HEAD AND THE OTHER RESTING UPON THE COVERLET IT WAS THE RIGHT HAND AND THE THIRD FINGER WAS MISSING
     FULL MEMORY FLOODED BACK AND SAM CRIED ALOUD IT WASNT A DREAM THEN WHERE ARE WE
     AND A VOICE SPOKE SOFTLY BEHIND IN THE LAND OF ITHILIEN AND IN THE KEEPING OF THE KING AND HE AWAITS YOU WITH THAT GANDALF STOOD BEFORE HIM ROBED IN WHITE HIS BEARD NOW GLEAMING LIKE PURE SNOW IN THE TWINKLING OF THE LEAFY SUNLIGHT WELL MASTER SAMWISE HOW DO YOU FEEL HE SAID
     BUT SAM LAY BACK AND STARED WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FOR A MOMENT BETWEEN BEWILDERMENT AND GREAT JOY HE COULD NOT ANSWER AT LAST HE GASPED GANDALF I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD BUT THEN I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD MYSELF IS EVERYTHING SAD GOING TO COME UNTRUE WHATS HAPPENED TO THE WORLD
     A GREAT SHADOW HAS DEPARTED SAID GANDALF AND THEN HE LAUGHED AND THE SOUND WAS LIKE MUSIC OR LIKE WATER IN A PARCHED LAND AND AS HE LISTENED THE THOUGHT CAME TO SAM THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD LAUGHTER THE PURE SOUND OF MERRIMENT FOR DAYS UPON DAYS WITHOUT COUNT IT FELL UPON HIS EARS LIKE THE ECHO OF ALL THE JOYS HE HAD EVER KNOWN BUT HE HIMSELF BURST INTO TEARS THEN AS A SWEET RAIN WILL PASS DOWN A WIND OF SPRING AND THE SUN WILL SHINE OUT THE CLEARER HIS TEARS CEASED AND HIS LAUGHTER WELLED UP AND LAUGHING HE SPRANG FROM HIS BED
     HOW DO I FEEL HE CRIED WELL I DONT KNOW HOW TO SAY IT I FEEL I FEEL  HE WAVED HIS ARMS IN THE AIR  I FEEL LIKE SPRING AFTER WINTER AND SUN ON THE LEAVES AND LIKE TRUMPETS AND HARPS AND ALL THE SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD HE STOPPED AND HE TURNED TOWARDS HIS MASTER BUT HOWS MR FRODO HE SAID ISNT IT A SHAME ABOUT HIS POOR HAND BUT I HOPE HES ALL RIGHT OTHERWISE HES HAD A CRUEL TIME
     YES I AM ALL RIGHT OTHERWISE SAID FRODO SITTING UP AND LAUGHING IN HIS TURN I FELL ASLEEP AGAIN WAITING FOR YOU SAM YOU SLEEPYHEAD I WAS AWAKE EARLY THIS MORNING AND NOW IT MUST BE NEARLY NOON
     NOON SAID SAM TRYING TO CALCULATE NOON OF WHAT DAY
     THE FOURTEENTH OF THE NEW YEAR SAID GANDALF OR IF YOU LIKE THE EIGHTH DAY OF APRIL IN THE SHIRE RECKONING2BUT IN GONDOR THE NEW YEAR WILL ALWAYS NOW BEGIN UPON THE TWENTYFIFTH OF MARCH WHEN SAURON FELL AND WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT OUT OF THE FIRE TO THE KING HE HAS TENDED YOU AND NOW HE AWAITS YOU YOU SHALL EAT AND DRINK WITH HIM WHEN YOU ARE READY I WILL LEAD YOU TO HIM
     THE KING SAID SAM WHAT KING AND WHO IS HE
     THE KING OF GONDOR AND LORD OF THE WESTERN LANDS SAID GANDALF AND HE HAS TAKEN BACK ALL HIS ANCIENT REALM HE WILL RIDE SOON TO HIS CROWNING BUT HE WAITS FOR YOU
     WHAT SHALL WE WEAR SAID SAM FOR ALL HE COULD SEE WAS THE OLD AND TATTERED CLOTHES THAT THEY HAD JOURNEYED IN LYING FOLDED ON THE GROUND BESIDE THEIR BEDS

     THEN HE HELD OUT HIS HANDS TO THEM AND THEY SAW THAT ONE SHONE WITH LIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE FRODO CRIED CAN IT BE  
     YES I HAVE BROUGHT YOUR TWO TREASURES THEY WERE FOUND ON SAM WHEN YOU WERE RESCUED THE LADY GALADRIELS GIFTS YOUR GLASS FRODO AND YOUR BOX SAM YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE THESE SAFE AGAIN
     WHEN THEY WERE WASHED AND CLAD AND HAD EATEN A LIGHT MEAL THE HOBBITS FOLLOWED GANDALF THEY STEPPED OUT OF THE BEECHGROVE IN WHICH THEY HAD LAIN AND PASSED ON TO A LONG GREEN LAWN GLOWING IN SUNSHINE BORDERED BY STATELY DARKLEAVED TREES LADEN WITH SCARLET BLOSSOM BEHIND THEM THEY COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF FALLING WATER AND A STREAM RAN DOWN BEFORE THEM BETWEEN FLOWERING BANKS UNTIL IT CAME TO A GREENWOOD AT THE LAWNS FOOT AND PASSED THEN ON UNDER AN ARCHWAY OF TREES THROUGH WHICH THEY SAW THE SHIMMER OF WATER FAR AWAY
     AS THEY CAME TO THE OPENING IN THE WOOD THEY WERE SURPRISED TO SEE KNIGHTS IN BRIGHT MAIL AND TALL GUARDS IN SILVER AND BLACK STANDING THERE WHO GREETED THEM WITH HONOUR AND BOWED BEFORE THEM AND THEN ONE BLEW A LONG TRUMPET AND THEY WENT ON THROUGH THE AISLE OF TREES BESIDE THE SINGING STREAM SO THEY CAME TO A WIDE GREEN LAND AND BEYOND IT WAS A BROAD RIVER IN A SILVER HAZE OUT OF WHICH ROSE A LONG WOODED ISLE AND MANY SHIPS LAY BY ITS SHORES BUT ON THE FIELD WHERE THEY NOW STOOD A GREAT HOST WAS DRAWN UP IN RANKS AND COMPANIES GLITTERING IN THE SUN AND AS THE HOBBITS APPROACHED SWORDS WERE UNSHEATHED AND SPEARS WERE SHAKEN AND HORNS AND TRUMPETS SANG AND MEN CRIED WITH MANY VOICES AND IN MANY TONGUES

     AND WHEN THE GLAD SHOUT HAD SWELLED UP AND DIED AWAY AGAIN TO SAMS FINAL AND COMPLETE SATISFACTION AND PURE JOY A MINSTREL OF GONDOR STOOD FORTH AND KNELT AND BEGGED LEAVE TO SING AND BEHOLD HE SAID
     LO LORDS AND KNIGHTS AND MEN OF VALOUR UNASHAMED KINGS AND PRINCES AND FAIR PEOPLE OF GONDOR AND RIDERS OF ROHAN AND YE SONS OF ELROND AND DUNEDAIN OF THE NORTH AND ELF AND DWARF AND GREATHEARTS OF THE SHIRE AND ALL FREE FOLK OF THE WEST NOW LISTEN TO MY LAY FOR I WILL SING TO YOU OF FRODO OF THE NINE FINGERS AND THE RING OF DOOM
     AND WHEN SAM HEARD THAT HE LAUGHED ALOUD FOR SHEER DELIGHT AND HE STOOD UP AND CRIED O GREAT GLORY AND SPLENDOUR AND ALL MY WISHES HAVE COME TRUE AND THEN HE WEPT
     AND ALL THE HOST LAUGHED AND WEPT AND IN THE MIDST OF THEIR MERRIMENT AND TEARS THE CLEAR VOICE OF THE MINSTREL ROSE LIKE SILVER AND GOLD AND ALL MEN WERE HUSHED AND HE SANG TO THEM NOW IN THE ELVENTONGUE NOW IN THE SPEECH OF THE WEST UNTIL THEIR HEARTS WOUNDED WITH SWEET WORDS OVERFLOWED AND THEIR JOY WAS LIKE SWORDS AND THEY PASSED IN THOUGHT OUT TO REGIONS WHERE PAIN AND DELIGHT FLOW TOGETHER AND TEARS ARE THE VERY WINE OF BLESSEDNESS
     AND AT THE LAST AS THE SUN FELL FROM THE NOON AND THE SHADOWS OF THE TREES LENGTHENED HE ENDED PRAISE THEM WITH GREAT PRAISE HE SAID AND KNELT AND THEN ARAGORN STOOD UP AND ALL THE HOST AROSE AND THEY PASSED TO PAVILIONS MADE READY TO EAT AND DRINK AND MAKE MERRY WHILE THE DAY LASTED
     FRODO AND SAM WERE LED APART AND BROUGHT TO A TENT AND THERE THEIR OLD RAIMENT WAS TAKEN OFF BUT FOLDED AND SET ASIDE WITH HONOUR AND CLEAN LINEN WAS GIVEN TO THEM THEN GANDALF CAME AND IN HIS ARMS TO THE WONDER OF FRODO HE BORE THE SWORD AND THE ELVENCLOAK AND THE MITHRILCOAT THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM IN MORDOR FOR SAM HE BROUGHT A COAT OF GILDED MAIL AND HIS ELVENCLOAK ALL HEALED OF THE SOILS AND HURTS THAT IT HAD SUFFERED AND THEN HE LAID BEFORE THEM TWO SWORDS
     I DO NOT WISH FOR ANY SWORD SAID FRODO
     TONIGHT AT LEAST YOU SHOULD WEAR ONE SAID GANDALF
     THEN FRODO TOOK THE SMALL SWORD THAT HAD BELONGED TO SAM AND HAD BEEN LAID AT HIS SIDE IN CIRITH UNGOL STING I GAVE TO YOU SAM HE SAID
     NO MASTER MR BILBO GAVE IT TO YOU AND IT GOES WITH HIS SILVER COAT HE WOULD NOT WISH ANYONE ELSE TO WEAR IT NOW
     FRODO GAVE WAY AND GANDALF AS IF HE WERE THEIR ESQUIRE KNELT AND GIRT THE SWORDBELTS ABOUT THEM AND THEN RISING HE SET CIRCLETS OF SILVER UPON THEIR HEADS AND WHEN THEY WERE ARRAYED THEY WENT TO THE GREAT FEAST AND THEY SAT AT THE KINGS TABLE WITH GANDALF AND KING 
     BUT WHEN AFTER THE STANDING SILENCE WINE WAS BROUGHT THERE CAME IN TWO ESQUIRES TO SERVE THE KINGS OR SO THEY SEEMED TO BE ONE WAS CLAD IN THE SILVER AND SABLE OF THE GUARDS OF MINAS TIRITH AND THE OTHER IN WHITE AND GREEN BUT SAM WONDERED WHAT SUCH YOUNG BOYS WERE DOING IN AN ARMY OF MIGHTY MEN THEN SUDDENLY AS THEY DREW NEAR AND HE COULD SEE THEM PLAINLY HE EXCLAIMED
     WHY LOOK MR FRODO LOOK HERE WELL IF IT ISNT PIPPIN MR PEREGRIN TOOK I SHOULD SAY AND MR MERRY HOW THEY HAVE GROWN BLESS ME BUT I CAN SEE THERES MORE TALES TO TELL THAN OURS
     THERE ARE INDEED SAID PIPPIN TURNING TOWARDS HIM AND WELL BEGIN TELLING THEM AS SOON AS THIS FEAST IS ENDED IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN TRY GANDALF HES NOT SO CLOSE AS HE USED TO BE THOUGH HE LAUGHS NOW MORE THAN HE TALKS FOR THE PRESENT MERRY AND I ARE BUSY WE ARE KNIGHTS OF THE CITY AND OF THE MARK AS I HOPE YOU OBSERVE
     AT LAST THE GLAD DAY ENDED AND WHEN THE SUN WAS GONE AND THE ROUND MOON RODE SLOWLY ABOVE THE MISTS OF ANDUIN AND FLICKERED THROUGH THE FLUTTERING LEAVES FRODO AND SAM SAT UNDER THE WHISPERING TREES AMID THE FRAGRANCE OF FAIR ITHILIEN AND THEY TALKED DEEP INTO THE NIGHT WITH MERRY AND PIPPIN AND GANDALF AND AFTER A WHILE LEGOLAS AND GIMLI JOINED THEM THERE FRODO AND SAM LEARNED MUCH OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE COMPANY AFTER THEIR FELLOWSHIP WAS BROKEN ON THE EVIL DAY AT PARTH GALEN BY RAUROS FALLS AND STILL THERE WAS ALWAYS MORE TO ASK AND MORE TO TELL
     ORCS AND TALKING TREES AND LEAGUES OF GRASS AND GALLOPING RIDERS AND GLITTERING CAVES AND WHITE TOWERS AND GOLDEN HALLS AND BATTLES AND TALL SHIPS SAILING ALL THESE PASSED BEFORE SAMS MIND UNTIL HE FELT BEWILDERED BUT AMIDST ALL THESE WONDERS HE RETURNED ALWAYS TO HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THE SIZE OF MERRY AND PIPPIN AND HE MADE THEM STAND BACK TO BACK WITH FRODO AND HIMSELF HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD CANT UNDERSTAND IT AT YOUR AGE HE SAID BUT THERE IT IS YOURE THREE INCHES TALLER THAN YOU OUGHT TO HE OR IM A DWARF
     THAT YOU CERTAINLY ARE NOT SAID GIMLI BUT WHAT DID I SAY MORTALS CANNOT GO DRINKING ENTDRAUGHTS AND EXPECT NO MORE TO COME OF THEM THAN OF A POT OF BEER
     ENTDRAUGHTS SAID SAM THERE YOU GO ABOUT ENTS AGAIN BUT WHAT THEY ARE BEATS ME WHY IT WILL TAKE WEEKS BEFORE WE GET ALL THESE THINGS SIZED UP
     WEEKS INDEED SAID PIPPIN AND THEN FRODO WILL HAVE TO BE LOCKED UP IN A TOWER IN MINAS TIRITH AND WRITE IT ALL DOWN OTHERWISE HE WILL FORGET HALF OF IT AND POOR OLD BILBO WILL BE DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTED
     AT LENGTH GANDALF ROSE THE HANDS OF THE KING ARE HANDS OF HEALING DEAR FRIENDS HE SAID BUT YOU WENT TO THE VERY BRINK OF DEATH ERE HE RECALLED YOU PUTTING FORTH ALL HIS POWER AND SENT YOU INTO THE SWEET FORGETFULNESS OF SLEEP AND THOUGH YOU HAVE INDEED SLEPT LONG AND BLESSEDLY STILL IT IS NOW TIME TO SLEEP AGAIN
     AND NOT ONLY SAM AND FRODO HERE SAID GIMLI BUT YOU TOO PIPPIN I LOVE YOU IF ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PAINS YOU HAVE COST ME WHICH I SHALL NEVER FORGET NOR SHALL I FORGET FINDING YOU ON THE HILL OF THE LAST BATTLE BUT FOR GIMLI THE DWARF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST THEN BUT AT LEAST I KNOW NOW THE LOOK OF A HOBBITS FOOT THOUGH IT BE ALL THAT CAN BE SEEN UNDER A HEAP OF BODIES AND WHEN I HEAVED THAT GREAT CARCASE OFF YOU I MADE SURE YOU WERE DEAD I COULD HAVE TORN OUT MY BEARD AND IT IS ONLY A DAY YET SINCE YOU WERE FIRST UP AND ABROAD AGAIN TO BED NOW YOU GO AND SO SHALL I
     AND I SAID LEGOLAS SHALL WALK IN THE WOODS OF THIS FAIR LAND WHICH IS REST ENOUGH IN DAYS TO COME IF MY ELVENLORD ALLOWS SOME OF OUR FOLK SHALL REMOVE HITHER AND WHEN WE COME IT SHALL BE BLESSED FOR A WHILE FOR A WHILE A MONTH A LIFE A HUNDRED YEARS OF MEN BUT ANDUIN IS NEAR AND ANDUIN LEADS DOWN TO THE SEA TO THE SEA
     
      
       TO THE SEA TO THE SEA THE WHITE GULLS ARE CRYING

       THE WIND IS BLOWING AND THE WHITE FOAM IS FLYING

       WEST WEST AWAY THE ROUND SUN IS FALLING

       GREY SHIP GREY SHIP DO YOU HEAR THEM CALLING

       THE VOICES OF MY PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE ME

       I WILL LEAVE I WILL LEAVE THE WOODS THAT BORE ME

       FOR OUR DAYS ARE ENDING AND OUR YEARS FAILING

       I WILL PASS THE WIDE WATERS LONELY SAILING

       LONG ARE THE WAVES ON THE LAST SHORE FALLING

       SWEET ARE THE VOICES IN THE LOST ISLE CALLING

       IN ERESSEA IN ELVENHOME THAT NO MAN CAN DISCOVER

       WHERE THE LEAVES FALL NOT LAND OF MY PEOPLE FOR EVER

      

     
     AND SO SINGING LEGOLAS WENT AWAY DOWN THE HILL
     THEN THE OTHERS ALSO DEPARTED AND FRODO AND SAM WENT TO THEIR BEDS AND SLEPT AND IN THE MORNING THEY ROSE AGAIN IN HOPE AND PEACE AND THEY SPENT MANY DAYS IN ITHILIEN FOR THE FIELD OF CORMALLEN WHERE THE HOST WAS NOW ENCAMPED WAS NEAR TO HENNETH ANNUN AND THE STREAM THAT FLOWED FROM ITS FALLS COULD BE HEARD IN THE NIGHT AS IT RUSHED DOWN THROUGH ITS ROCKY GATE AND PASSED THROUGH THE FLOWERY MEADS INTO THE TIDES OF ANDUIN BY THE ISLE OF CAIR ANDROS THE HOBBITS WANDERED HERE AND THERE VISITING AGAIN THE PLACES THAT THEY HAD PASSED BEFORE AND SAM HOPED ALWAYS IN SOME SHADOW OF THE WOODS OR SECRET GLADE TO CATCH MAYBE A GLIMPSE OF THE GREAT OLIPHAUNT AND WHEN HE LEARNED THAT AT THE SIEGE OF GONDOR THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT NUMBER OF THESE BEASTS BUT THAT THEY WERE ALL DESTROYED HE THOUGHT IT A SAD LOSS
     WELL ONE CANT BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE I SUPPOSE HE SAID BUT I MISSED A LOT SEEMINGLY
     IN THE MEANWHILE THE HOST MADE READY FOR THE RETURN TO MINAS TIRITH THE WEARY RESTED AND THE HURT WERE HEALED FOR SOME HAD LABOURED AND FOUGHT MUCH WITH THE REMNANTS OF THE EASTERLINGS AND SOUTHRONS UNTIL ALL WERE SUBDUED AND LATEST OF ALL THOSE RETURNED WHO HAD PASSED INTO MORDOR AND DESTROYED THE FORTRESSES IN THE NORTH OF THE LAND
     BUT AT THE LAST WHEN THE MONTH OF MAY WAS DRAWING NEAR THE CAPTAINS OF THE WEST SET OUT AGAIN AND THEY WENT ABOARD SHIP WITH ALL THEIR MEN AND THEY SAILED FROM CAIR ANDROS DOWN ANDUIN TO OSGILIATH AND THERE THEY REMAINED FOR ONE DAY AND THE DAY AFTER THEY CAME TO THE GREEN FIELDS OF THE PELENNOR AND SAW AGAIN THE WHITE TOWERS UNDER TALL MINDOLLUIN THE CITY OF THE MEN OF GONDOR LAST MEMORY OF WESTERNESSE THAT HAD PASSED THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND FIRE TO A NEW DAY
     AND THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE FIELDS THEY SET UP THEIR PAVILIONS AND AWAITED THE MORNING FOR IT WAS THE EVE OF MAY AND THE KING WOULD ENTER HIS GATES WITH THE RISING OF THE SUN
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 5
      THE STEWARD AND THE KING
     

     OVER THE CITY OF GONDOR DOUBT AND GREAT DREAD HAD HUNG FAIR WEATHER AND CLEAR SUN HAD SEEMED BUT A MOCKERY TO MEN WHOSE DAYS HELD LITTLE HOPE AND WHO LOOKED EACH MORNING FOR NEWS OF DOOM THEIR LORD WAS DEAD AND BURNED DEAD LAY THE KING OF ROHAN IN THEIR CITADEL AND THE NEW KING THAT HAD COME TO THEM IN THE NIGHT WAS GONE AGAIN TO A WAR WITH POWERS TOO DARK AND TERRIBLE FOR ANY MIGHT OR VALOUR TO CONQUER AND NO NEWS CAME AFTER THE HOST LEFT MORGUL VALE AND TOOK THE NORTHWARD ROAD BENEATH THE SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAINS NO MESSENGER HAD RETURNED NOR ANY RUMOUR OF WHAT WAS PASSING IN THE BROODING EAST
     WHEN THE CAPTAINS WERE BUT TWO DAYS GONE THE LADY 
     SIR SHE SAID I AM IN GREAT UNREST AND I CANNOT LIE LONGER IN SLOTH
     LADY HE ANSWERED YOU ARE NOT YET HEALED AND I WAS COMMANDED TO TEND YOU WITH ESPECIAL CARE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE RISEN FROM YOUR BED FOR SEVEN DAYS YET OR SO I WAS BIDDEN I BEG YOU TO GO BACK
     I AM HEALED SHE SAID HEALED AT LEAST IN BODY SAVE MY LEFT ARM ONLY AND THAT IS AT EASE BUT I SHALL SICKEN ANEW IF THERE IS NAUGHT THAT I CAN DO ARE THERE NO TIDINGS OF WAR THE WOMEN CAN TELL ME NOTHING
     THERE ARE NO TIDINGS SAID THE WARDEN SAVE THAT THE LORDS HAVE RIDDEN TO MORGUL VALE AND MEN SAY THAT THE NEW CAPTAIN OUT OF THE NORTH IS THEIR CHIEF A GREAT LORD IS THAT AND A HEALER AND IT IS A THING PASSING STRANGE TO ME THAT THE HEALING HAND SHOULD ALSO WIELD THE SWORD IT IS NOT THUS IN GONDOR NOW THOUGH ONCE IT WAS SO IF OLD TALES BE TRUE BUT FOR LONG YEARS WE HEALERS HAVE ONLY SOUGHT TO PATCH THE RENTS MADE BY THE MEN OF SWORDS THOUGH WE SHOULD STILL HAVE ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT THEM THE WORLD IS FULL ENOUGH OF HURTS AND MISCHANCES WITHOUT WARS TO MULTIPLY THEM
     IT NEEDS BUT ONE FOE TO BREED A WAR NOT TWO MASTER WARDEN ANSWERED  I WOULD CHOOSE THE LATTER
     THE WARDEN LOOKED AT HER TALL SHE STOOD THERE HER EYES BRIGHT IN HER WHITE FACE HER HAND CLENCHED AS SHE TURNED AND GAZED OUT OF HIS WINDOW THAT OPENED TO THE EAST HE SIGHED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AFTER A PAUSE SHE TURNED TO HIM AGAIN
     IS THERE NO DEED TO DO SHE SAID WHO COMMANDS IN THIS CITY
     I DO NOT RIGHTLY KNOW HE ANSWERED SUCH THINGS ARE NOT MY CARE THERE IS A MARSHAL OVER THE RIDERS OF ROHAN AND THE LORD HURIN I AM TOLD COMMANDS THE MEN OF GONDOR BUT THE LORD FARAMIR IS BY RIGHT THE STEWARD OF THE CITY
     WHERE CAN I FIND HIM
     IN THIS HOUSE LADY HE WAS SORELY HURT BUT IS NOW SET AGAIN ON THE WAY TO HEALTH BUT I DO NOT KNOW
     WILL YOU NOT BRING ME TO HIM THEN YOU WILL KNOW
     THE LORD FARAMIR WAS WALKING ALONE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOUSES OF HEALING AND THE SUNLIGHT WARMED HIM AND HE FELT LIFE RUN NEW IN HIS VEINS BUT HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE WALLS EASTWARD AND COMING THE WARDEN SPOKE HIS NAME AND HE TURNED AND SAW THE LADY 
     MY LORD SAID THE WARDEN HERE IS THE LADY 
     DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND HIM LORD SAID 
     AT A SIGN FROM FARAMIR THE WARDEN BOWED AND DEPARTED WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO LADY SAID FARAMIR I ALSO AM A PRISONER OF THE HEALERS HE LOOKED AT HER AND BEING A MAN WHOM PITY DEEPLY STIRRED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HER LOVELINESS AMID HER GRIEF WOULD PIERCE HIS HEART AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW THE GRAVE TENDERNESS IN HIS EYES AND YET KNEW FOR SHE WAS BRED AMONG MEN OF WAR THAT HERE WAS ONE WHOM NO RIDER OF THE MARK WOULD OUTMATCH IN BATTLE
     WHAT DO YOU WISH HE SAID AGAIN IF IT LIES IN MY POWER I WILL DO IT
     I WOULD HAVE YOU COMMAND THIS WARDEN AND BID HIM LET ME GO SHE SAID BUT THOUGH HER WORDS WERE STILL PROUD HER HEART FALTERED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE DOUBTED HERSELF SHE GUESSED THAT THIS TALL MAN BOTH STERN AND GENTLE MIGHT THINK HER MERELY WAYWARD LIKE A CHILD THAT HAS NOT THE FIRMNESS OF MIND TO GO ON WITH A DULL TASK TO THE END
     I MYSELF AM IN THE WARDENS KEEPING ANSWERED FARAMIR NOR HAVE I YET TAKEN UP MY AUTHORITY IN THE CITY BUT HAD I DONE SO I SHOULD STILL LISTEN TO HIS COUNSEL AND SHOULD NOT CROSS HIS WILL IN MATTERS OF HIS CRAFT UNLESS IN SOME GREAT NEED
     BUT I DO NOT DESIRE HEALING SHE SAID I WISH TO RIDE TO WAR LIKE MY BROTHER 
     IT IS TOO LATE LADY TO FOLLOW THE CAPTAINS EVEN IF YOU HAD THE STRENGTH SAID FARAMIR BUT DEATH IN BATTLE MAY COME TO US ALL YET WILLING OR UNWILLING YOU WILL BE BETTER PREPARED TO FACE IT IN YOUR OWN MANNER IF WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME YOU DO AS THE HEALER COMMANDED YOU AND I WE MUST ENDURE WITH PATIENCE THE HOURS OF WAITING
     SHE DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE LOOKED AT HER IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SOMETHING IN HER SOFTENED AS THOUGH A BITTER FROST WERE YIELDING AT THE FIRST FAINT PRESAGE OF SPRING A TEAR SPRANG IN HER EYE AND FELL DOWN HER CHEEK LIKE A GLISTENING RAINDROP HER PROUD HEAD DROOPED A LITTLE THEN QUIETLY MORE AS IF SPEAKING TO HERSELF THAN TO HIM BUT THE HEALERS WOULD HAVE ME LIE ABED SEVEN DAYS YET SHE SAID AND MY WINDOW DOES NOT LOOK EASTWARD HER VOICE WAS NOW THAT OF A MAIDEN YOUNG AND SAD
     FARAMIR SMILED THOUGH HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH PITY YOUR WINDOW DOES NOT LOOK EASTWARD HE SAID THAT CAN BE AMENDED IN THIS I WILL COMMAND THE WARDEN IF YOU WILL STAY IN THIS HOUSE IN OUR CARE LADY AND TAKE YOUR REST THEN YOU SHALL WALK IN THIS GARDEN IN THE SUN AS YOU WILL AND YOU SHALL LOOK EAST WHITHER ALL OUR HOPES HAVE GONE AND HERE YOU WILL FIND ME WALKING AND WAITING AND ALSO LOOKING EAST IT WOULD EASE MY CARE IF YOU WOULD SPEAK TO ME OR WALK AT WHILES WITH ME
     THEN SHE RAISED HER HEAD AND LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES AGAIN AND A COLOUR CAME IN HER PALE FACE HOW SHOULD I EASE YOUR CARE MY LORD SHE SAID AND I DO NOT DESIRE THE SPEECH OF LIVING MEN
     WOULD YOU HAVE MY PLAIN ANSWER HE SAID
     I WOULD
     THEN ORLD AND WHEN IT COMES I HOPE TO FACE IT STEADILY BUT IT WOULD EASE MY HEART IF WHILE THE SUN YET SHINES I COULD SEE YOU STILL FOR YOU AND I HAVE BOTH PASSED UNDER THE WINGS OF THE SHADOW AND THE SAME HAND DREW US BACK
     ALAS NOT ME LORD SHE SAID SHADOW LIES ON ME STILL LOOK NOT TO ME FOR HEALING I AM A SHIELDMAIDEN AND MY HAND IS UNGENTLE BUT I THANK YOU FOR THIS AT LEAST THAT I NEED NOT KEEP TO MY CHAMBER I WILL WALK ABROAD BY THE GRACE OF THE STEWARD OF THE CITY AND SHE DID HIM A COURTESY AND WALKED BACK TO THE HOUSE BUT FARAMIR FOR A LONG WHILE WALKED ALONE IN THE GARDEN AND HIS GLANCE NOW STRAYED RATHER TO THE HOUSE THAN TO THE EASTWARD WALLS
     WHEN HE RETURNED TO HIS CHAMBER HE CALLED FOR THE WARDEN AND HEARD ALL THAT HE COULD TELL OF THE LADY OF ROHAN
     BUT I DOUBT NOT LORD SAID THE WARDEN THAT YOU WOULD LEARN MORE FROM THE HALFLING THAT IS WITH US FOR HE WAS IN THE RIDING OF THE KING AND WITH THE LADY AT THE END THEY SAY
     AND SO MERRY WAS SENT TO FARAMIR AND WHILE THAT DAY LASTED THEY TALKED LONG TOGETHER AND FARAMIR LEARNED MUCH MORE EVEN THAN MERRY PUT INTO WORDS AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE UNDERSTOOD NOW SOMETHING OF THE GRIEF AND UNREST OF 
     BUT IN THE MORNING AS FARAMIR CAME FROM THE HOUSES HE SAW HER AS SHE STOOD UPON THE WALLS AND SHE WAS CLAD ALL IN WHITE AND GLEAMED IN THE SUN AND HE CALLED TO HER AND SHE CAME DOWN AND THEY WALKED ON THE GRASS OR SAT UNDER A GREEN TREE TOGETHER NOW IN SILENCE NOW IN SPEECH AND EACH DAY AFTER THEY DID LIKEWISE AND THE WARDEN LOOKING FROM HIS WINDOW WAS GLAD IN HEART FOR HE WAS A HEALER AND HIS CARE WAS LIGHTENED AND CERTAIN IT WAS THAT HEAVY AS WAS THE DREAD AND FOREBODING OF THOSE DAYS UPON THE HEARTS OF MEN STILL THESE TWO OF HIS CHARGES PROSPERED AND GREW DAILY IN STRENGTH
     AND SO THE FIFTH DAY CAME SINCE THE LADY  IT WAS RISING BUT THE LANDS ABOUT LOOKED GREY AND DREAR
     THEY WERE CLAD IN WARM RAIMENT AND HEAVY CLOAKS AND OVER ALL THE LADY S MOTHER FINDUILAS OF AMROTH WHO DIED UNTIMELY AND WAS TO HIM BUT A MEMORY OF LOVELINESS IN FAR DAYS AND OF HIS FIRST GRIEF AND HER ROBE SEEMED TO HIM RAIMENT FITTING FOR THE BEAUTY AND SADNESS OF 
     BUT SHE NOW SHIVERED BENEATH THE STARRY MANTLE AND SHE LOOKED NORTHWARD ABOVE THE GREY HITHER LANDS INTO THE EYE OF THE COLD WIND WHERE FAR AWAY THE SKY WAS HARD AND CLEAR
     WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR 
     DOES NOT THE BLACK GATE LIE YONDER SAID SHE AND MUST HE NOT NOW BE COME THITHER IT IS SEVEN DAYS SINCE HE RODE AWAY
     SEVEN DAYS SAID FARAMIR BUT THINK NOT ILL OF ME IF I SAY TO YOU THEY HAVE BROUGHT ME BOTH A JOY AND A PAIN THAT I NEVER THOUGHT TO KNOW JOY TO SEE YOU BUT PAIN BECAUSE NOW THE FEAR AND DOUBT OF THIS EVIL TIME ARE GROWN DARK INDEED 
     LOSE WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND LORD SHE ANSWERED BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM GRAVELY AND HER EYES WERE KIND I KNOW NOT WHAT IN THESE DAYS YOU HAVE FOUND THAT YOU COULD LOSE BUT COME MY FRIEND LET US NOT SPEAK OF IT LET US NOT SPEAK AT ALL I STAND UPON SOME DREADFUL BRINK AND IT IS UTTERLY DARK IN THE ABYSS BEFORE MY FEET BUT WHETHER THERE IS ANY LIGHT BEHIND ME I CANNOT TELL FOR I CANNOT TURN YET I WAIT FOR SOME STROKE OF DOOM
     YES WE WAIT FOR THE STROKE OF DOOM SAID FARAMIR AND THEY SAID NO MORE AND IT SEEMED TO THEM AS THEY STOOD UPON THE WALL THAT THE WIND DIED AND THE LIGHT FAILED AND THE SUN WAS BLEARED AND ALL SOUNDS IN THE CITY OR IN THE LANDS ABOUT WERE HUSHED NEITHER WIND NOR VOICE NOR BIRDCALL NOR RUSTLE OF LEAF NOR THEIR OWN BREATH COULD BE HEARD THE VERY BEATING OF THEIR HEARTS WAS STILLED TIME HALTED
     AND AS THEY STOOD SO THEIR HANDS MET AND CLASPED THOUGH THEY DID NOT KNOW IT AND STILL THEY WAITED FOR THEY KNEW NOT WHAT THEN PRESENTLY IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT ABOVE THE RIDGES OF THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS ANOTHER VAST MOUNTAIN OF DARKNESS ROSE TOWERING UP LIKE A WAVE THAT SHOULD ENGULF THE WORLD AND ABOUT IT LIGHTNINGS FLICKERED AND THEN A TREMOR RAN THROUGH THE EARTH AND THEY FELT THE WALLS OF THE CITY QUIVER A SOUND LIKE A SIGH WENT UP FROM ALL THE LANDS ABOUT THEM AND THEIR HEARTS BEAT SUDDENLY AGAIN
     IT REMINDS ME OF N
     OF N
     YES SAID FARAMIR OF THE LAND OF WESTERNESSE THAT FOUNDERED AND OF THE GREAT DARK WAVE CLIMBING OVER THE GREEN LANDS AND ABOVE THE HILLS AND COMING ON DARKNESS UNESCAPABLE I OFTEN DREAM OF IT
     THEN YOU THINK THAT THE DARKNESS IS COMING SAID 
     NO SAID FARAMIR LOOKING INTO HER FACE IT WAS BUT A PICTURE IN THE MIND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING THE REASON OF MY WAKING MIND TELLS ME THAT GREAT EVIL HAS BEFALLEN AND WE STAND AT THE END OF DAYS BUT MY HEART SAYS NAY AND ALL MY LIMBS ARE LIGHT AND A HOPE AND JOY ARE COME TO ME THAT NO REASON CAN DENY 
     AND SO THEY STOOD ON THE WALLS OF THE CITY OF GONDOR AND A GREAT WIND ROSE AND BLEW AND THEIR HAIR RAVEN AND GOLDEN STREAMED OUT MINGLING IN THE AIR AND THE SHADOW DEPARTED AND THE SUN WAS UNVEILED AND LIGHT LEAPED FORTH AND THE WATERS OF ANDUIN SHONE LIKE SILVER AND IN ALL THE HOUSES OF THE CITY MEN SANG FOR THE JOY THAT WELLED UP IN THEIR HEARTS FROM WHAT SOURCE THEY COULD NOT TELL
     AND BEFORE THE SUN HAD FALLEN FAR FROM THE NOON OUT OF THE EAST THERE CAME A GREAT EAGLE FLYING AND HE BORE TIDINGS BEYOND HOPE FROM THE LORDS OF THE WEST CRYING
     
      
       SING NOW YE PEOPLE OF THE TOWER OF ANOR

       FOR THE REALM OF SAURON IS ENDED FOR EVER

       AND THE DARK TOWER IS THROWN DOWN

       SING AND BE GLAD ALL YE CHILDREN OF THE WEST

       AND THE CITY SHALL BE BLESSED

      

      
       SING ALL YE PEOPLE

      

     
     AND THE PEOPLE SANG IN ALL THE WAYS OF THE CITY
     THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE GOLDEN AND SPRING AND SUMMER JOINED AND MADE REVEL TOGETHER IN THE FIELDS OF GONDOR AND TIDINGS NOW CAME BY SWIFT RIDERS FROM CAIR ANDROS OF ALL THAT WAS DONE AND THE CITY MADE READY FOR THE COMING OF THE KING MERRY WAS SUMMONED AND RODE AWAY WITH THE WAINS THAT TOOK STORE OF GOODS TO OSGILIATH AND THENCE BY SHIP TO CAIR ANDROS BUT FARAMIR DID NOT GO FOR NOW BEING HEALED HE TOOK UPON HIM HIS AUTHORITY AND THE STEWARDSHIP ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND HIS DUTY WAS TO PREPARE FOR ONE WHO SHOULD REPLACE HIM
     AND HAT IN ALL THE CITY SHE ONLY WAS AILING AND SORROWFUL AND THE WARDEN OF THE HOUSES WAS TROUBLED AND HE SPOKE TO FARAMIR
     THEN FARAMIR CAME AND SOUGHT HER AND ONCE MORE THEY STOOD ON THE WALLS TOGETHER AND HE SAID TO HER 
     AND SHE SAID DO YOU NOT KNOW
     BUT HE ANSWERED TWO REASONS THERE MAY BE BUT WHICH IS TRUE L DO NOT KNOW
     AND SHE SAID I DO NOT WISH TO PLAY AT RIDDLES SPEAK PLAINER
     THEN IF YOU WILL HAVE IT SO LADY HE SAID YOU DO NOT GO BECAUSE ONLY YOUR BROTHER CALLED FOR YOU AND TO LOOK ON THE LORD ARAGORN ELENDILS HEIR IN HIS TRIUMPH WOULD NOW BRING YOU NO JOY OR BECAUSE I DO NOT GO AND YOU DESIRE STILL TO BE NEAR ME AND MAYBE FOR BOTH THESE REASONS AND YOU YOURSELF CANNOT CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM 
     I WISHED TO BE LOVED BY ANOTHER SHE ANSWERED BUT I DESIRE NO MANS PITY
     THAT I KNOW HE SAID YOU DESIRED TO HAVE THE LOVE OF THE LORD ARAGORN BECAUSE HE WAS HIGH AND PUISSANT AND YOU WISHED TO HAVE RENOWN AND GLORY AND TO BE LIFTED FAR ABOVE THE MEAN THINGS THAT CRAWL ON THE EARTH AND AS A GREAT CAPTAIN MAY TO A YOUNG SOLDIER HE SEEMED TO YOU ADMIRABLE FOR SO HE IS A LORD AMONG MEN THE GREATEST THAT NOW IS BUT WHEN HE GAVE YOU ONLY UNDERSTANDING AND PITY THEN YOU DESIRED TO HAVE NOTHING UNLESS A BRAVE DEATH IN BATTLE LOOK AT ME 
     AND  THE WORDS OF THE ELVENTONGUE TO TELL AND I LOVE YOU ONCE I PITIED YOUR SORROW BUT NOW WERE YOU SORROWLESS WITHOUT FEAR OR ANY LACK WERE YOU THE BLISSFUL QUEEN OF GONDOR STILL I WOULD LOVE YOU 
     THEN THE HEART OF

     THEN FARAMIR LAUGHED MERRILY THAT IS WELL HE SAID FOR I AM NOT A KING YET I WILL WED WITH THE WHITE LADY OF ROHAN IF IT BE HER WILL AND IF SHE WILL THEN LET US CROSS THE RIVER AND IN HAPPIER DAYS LET US DWELL IN FAIR ITHILIEN AND THERE MAKE A GARDEN ALL THINGS WILL GROW WITH JOY THERE IF THE WHITE LADY COMES
     THEN MUST I LEAVE MY OWN PEOPLE MAN OF GONDOR SHE SAID AND WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR PROUD FOLK SAY OF YOU THERE GOES A LORD WHO TAMED A WILD SHIELDMAIDEN OF THE NORTH WAS THERE NO WOMAN OF THE RACE OF N
     I WOULD SAID FARAMIR AND HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER UNDER THE SUNLIT SKY AND HE CARED NOT THAT THEY STOOD HIGH UPON THE WALLS IN THE SIGHT OF MANY AND MANY INDEED SAW THEM AND THE LIGHT THAT SHONE ABOUT THEM AS THEY CAME DOWN FROM THE WALLS AND WENT HAND IN HAND TO THE HOUSES OF HEALING
     AND TO THE WARDEN OF THE HOUSES FARAMIR SAID HERE IS THE LADY 
     AND THE WARDEN SAID THEN I RELEASE HER FROM MY CHARGE AND BID HER FAREWELL AND MAY SHE SUFFER NEVER HURT NOR SICKNESS AGAIN I COMMEND HER TO THE CARE OF THE STEWARD OF THE CITY UNTIL HER BROTHER RETURNS
     BUT 
     ALL THINGS WERE NOW MADE READY IN THE CITY AND THERE WAS GREAT CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE FOR THE TIDINGS HAD GONE OUT INTO ALL PARTS OF GONDOR FROM MINRIMMON EVEN TO PINNATH GELIN AND THE FAR COASTS OF THE SEA AND ALL THAT COULD COME TO THE CITY MADE HASTE TO COME AND THE CITY WAS FILLED AGAIN WITH WOMEN AND FAIR CHILDREN THAT RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES LADEN WITH FLOWERS AND FROM DOL AMROTH CAME THE HARPERS THAT HARPED MOST SKILFULLY IN ALL THE LAND AND THERE WERE PLAYERS UPON VIOLS AND UPON FLUTES AND UPON HORNS OF SILVER AND CLEARVOICED SINGERS FROM THE VALES OF LEBENNIN

     AND IORETH SAID TO HER KINSWOMAN THIS IS JUST A CEREMONY SUCH AS WE HAVE IN THE CITY COUSIN FOR HE HAS ALREADY ENTERED AS I WAS TELLING YOU AND HE SAID TO ME AND THEN AGAIN SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SILENCE FOR FARAMIR SPOKE AGAIN
     MEN OF GONDOR THE LOREMASTERS TELL THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF OLD THAT THE KING SHOULD RECEIVE THE CROWN FROM HIS FATHER ERE HE DIED OR IF THAT MIGHT NOT BE THAT HE SHOULD GO ALONE AND TAKE IT FROM THE HANDS OF HIS FATHER IN THE TOMB WHERE HE WAS LAID BUT SINCE THINGS MUST NOW BE DONE OTHERWISE USING THE AUTHORITY OF THE STEWARD I HAVE TODAY BROUGHT HITHER FROM RATH D
     THEN THE GUARDS STEPPED FORWARD AND FARAMIR OPENED THE CASKET AND HE HELD UP AN ANCIENT CROWN IT WAS SHAPED LIKE THE HELMS OF THE GUARDS OF THE CITADEL SAVE THAT IT WAS LOFTIER AND IT WAS ALL WHITE AND THE WINGS AT EITHER SIDE WERE WROUGHT OF PEARL AND SILVER IN THE LIKENESS OF THE WINGS OF A SEABIRD FOR IT WAS THE EMBLEM OF KINGS WHO CAME OVER THE SEA AND SEVEN GEMS OF ADAMANT WERE SET IN THE CIRCLET AND UPON ITS SUMMIT WAS SET A SINGLE JEWEL THE LIGHT OF WHICH WENT UP LIKE A FLAME
     THEN ARAGORN TOOK THE CROWN AND HELD IT UP AND SAID
     ET E
     AND THOSE WERE THE WORDS THAT ELENDIL SPOKE WHEN HE CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND OUT OF THE GREAT SEA TO MIDDLEEARTH I AM COME IN THIS PLACE WILL I ABIDE AND MY HEIRS UNTO THE ENDING OF THE WORLD
     THEN TO THE WONDER OF MANY ARAGORN DID NOT PUT THE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD BUT GAVE IT BACK TO FARAMIR AND SAID BY THE LABOUR AND VALOUR OF MANY I HAVE COME INTO MY INHERITANCE IN TOKEN OF THIS I WOULD HAVE THE RINGBEARER BRING THE CROWN TO ME AND LET MITHRANDIR SET IT UPON MY HEAD IF HE WILL FOR HE HAS BEEN THE MOVER OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND THIS IS HIS VICTORY
     THEN FRODO CAME FORWARD AND TOOK THE CROWN FROM FARAMIR AND BORE IT TO GANDALF AND ARAGORN KNELT AND GANDALF SET THE WHITE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD AND SAID
     NOW COME THE DAYS OF THE KING AND MAY THEY BE BLESSED WHILE THE THRONES OF THE VALAR ENDURE
     BUT WHEN ARAGORN AROSE ALL THAT BEHELD HIM GAZED IN SILENCE FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT HE WAS REVEALED TO THEM NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TALL AS THE SEAKINGS OF OLD HE STOOD ABOVE ALL THAT WERE NEAR ANCIENT OF DAYS HE SEEMED AND YET IN THE FLOWER OF MANHOOD AND WISDOM SAT UPON HIS BROW AND STRENGTH AND HEALING WERE IN HIS HANDS AND A LIGHT WAS ABOUT HIM AND THEN FARAMIR CRIED
     BEHOLD THE KING
     AND IN THAT MOMENT ALL THE TRUMPETS WERE BLOWN AND THE KING ELESSAR WENT FORTH AND CAME TO THE BARRIER AND HURIN OF THE KEYS THRUST IT BACK AND AMID THE MUSIC OF HARP AND OF VIOL AND OF FLUTE AND THE SINGING OF CLEAR VOICES THE KING PASSED THROUGH THE FLOWERLADEN STREETS AND CAME TO THE CITADEL AND ENTERED IN AND THE BANNER OF THE TREE AND THE STARS WAS UNFURLED UPON THE TOPMOST TOWER AND THE REIGN OF KING ELESSAR BEGAN OF WHICH MANY SONGS HAVE TOLD
     IN HIS TIME THE CITY WAS MADE MORE FAIR THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN EVEN IN THE DAYS OF ITS FIRST GLORY AND IT WAS FILLED WITH TREES AND WITH FOUNTAINS AND ITS GATES WERE WROUGHT OF MITHRIL AND STEEL AND ITS STREETS WERE PAVED WITH WHITE MARBLE AND THE FOLK OF THE MOUNTAIN LABOURED IN IT AND THE FOLK OF THE WOOD REJOICED TO COME THERE AND ALL WAS HEALED AND MADE GOOD AND THE HOUSES WERE FILLED WITH MEN AND WOMEN AND THE LAUGHTER OF CHILDREN AND NO WINDOW WAS BLIND NOR ANY COURTYARD EMPTY AND AFTER THE ENDING OF THE THIRD AGE OF THE WORLD INTO THE NEW AGE IT PRESERVED THE MEMORY AND THE GLORY OF THE YEARS THAT WERE GONE
     IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED HIS CROWNING THE KING SAT ON HIS THRONE IN THE HALL OF THE KINGS AND PRONOUNCED HIS JUDGEMENTS AND EMBASSIES CAME FROM MANY LANDS AND PEOPLES FROM THE EAST AND THE SOUTH AND FROM THE BORDERS OF MIRKWOOD AND FROM DUNLAND IN THE WEST AND THE KING PARDONED THE EASTERLINGS THAT HAD GIVEN THEMSELVES UP AND SENT THEM AWAY FREE AND HE MADE PEACE WITH THE PEOPLES OF HARAD AND THE SLAVES OF MORDOR HE RELEASED AND GAVE TO THEM ALL THE LANDS ABOUT LAKE NURNEN TO BE THEIR OWN AND THERE WERE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM MANY TO RECEIVE HIS PRAISE AND REWARD FOR THEIR VALOUR AND LAST THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD BROUGHT TO HIM BEREGOND TO BE JUDGED
     AND THE KING SAID TO BEREGOND BEREGOND BY YOUR SWORD BLOOD WAS SPILLED IN THE HALLOWS WHERE THAT IS FORBIDDEN ALSO YOU LEFT YOUR POST WITHOUT LEAVE OF LORD OR OF CAPTAIN FOR THESE THINGS OF OLD DEATH WAS THE PENALTY NOW THEREFORE I MUST PRONOUNCE YOUR DOOM
     ALL PENALTY IS REMITTED FOR YOUR VALOUR IN BATTLE AND STILL MORE BECAUSE ALL THAT YOU DID WAS FOR THE LOVE OF THE LORD FARAMIR NONETHELESS YOU MUST LEAVE THE GUARD OF THE CITADEL AND YOU MUST GO FORTH FROM THE CITY OF MINAS TIRITH
     THEN THE BLOOD LEFT BEREGONDS FACE AND HE WAS STRICKEN TO THE HEART AND BOWED HIS HEAD BUT THE KING SAID
     SO IT MUST BE FOR YOU ARE APPOINTED TO THE WHITE COMPANY THE GUARD OF FARAMIR PRINCE OF ITHILIEN AND YOU SHALL BE ITS CAPTAIN AND DWELL IN EMYN ARNEN IN HONOUR AND PEACE AND IN THE SERVICE OF HIM FOR WHOM YOU RISKED ALL TO SAVE HIM FROM DEATH
     AND THEN BEREGOND PERCEIVING THE MERCY AND JUSTICE OF THE KING WAS GLAD AND KNEELING KISSED HIS HAND AND DEPARTED IN JOY AND CONTENT AND ARAGORN GAVE TO FARAMIR ITHILIEN TO BE HIS PRINCEDOM AND BADE HIM DWELL IN THE HILLS OF EMYN ARNEN WITHIN SIGHT OF THE CITY
     FOR SAID HE MINAS ITHIL IN MORGUL VALE SHALL BE UTTERLY DESTROYED AND THOUGH IT MAY IN TIME TO COME BE MADE CLEAN NO MAN MAY DWELL THERE FOR MANY LONG YEARS
     AND LAST OF ALL ARAGORN GREETED  NOW AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE LAID TH
     AND R HIM BUT HERE LET HIM SLEEP A WHILE
     AND 
     SO THE GLAD DAYS PASSED AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF MAY THE RIDERS OF ROHAN MADE READY AND RODE OFF BY THE NORTHWAY AND WITH THEM WENT THE SONS OF ELROND ALL THE ROAD WAS LINED WITH PEOPLE TO DO THEM HONOUR AND PRAISE THEM FROM THE GATE OF THE CITY TO THE WALLS OF THE PELENNOR THEN ALL OTHERS THAT DWELT AFAR WENT BACK TO THEIR HOMES REJOICING BUT IN THE CITY THERE WAS LABOUR OF MANY WILLING HANDS TO REBUILD AND RENEW AND TO REMOVE ALL THE SCARS OF WAR AND THE MEMORY OF THE DARKNESS
     THE HOBBITS STILL REMAINED IN MINAS TIRITH WITH LEGOLAS AND GIMLI FOR ARAGORN WAS LOTH FOR THE FELLOWSHIP TO BE DISSOLVED AT LAST ALL SUCH THINGS MUST END HE SAID BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU WAIT A LITTLE WHILE LONGER FOR THE END OF THE DEEDS THAT YOU HAVE SHARED IN HAS NOT YET COME A DAY DRAWS NEAR THAT I HAVE LOOKED FOR IN ALL THE YEARS OF MY MANHOOD AND WHEN IT COMES I WOULD HAVE MY FRIENDS BESIDE ME BUT OF THAT DAY HE WOULD SAY NO MORE
     IN THOSE DAYS THE COMPANIONS OF THE RING DWELT TOGETHER IN A FAIR HOUSE WITH GANDALF AND THEY WENT TO AND FRO AS THEY WISHED AND FRODO SAID TO GANDALF DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS DAY IS THAT ARAGORN SPEAKS OF FOR WE ARE HAPPY HERE AND I DONT WISH TO GO BUT THE DAYS ARE RUNNING AWAY AND BILBO IS WAITING AND THE SHIRE IS MY HOME
     AS FOR BILBO SAID GANDALF HE IS WAITING FOR THE SAME DAY AND HE KNOWS WHAT KEEPS YOU AND AS FOR THE PASSING OF THE DAYS IT IS NOW ONLY MAY AND HIGH SUMMER IS NOT YET IN AND THOUGH ALL THINGS MAY SEEM CHANGED AS IF AN AGE OF THE WORLD HAD GONE BY YET TO THE TREES AND THE GRASS IT IS LESS THAN A YEAR SINCE YOU SET OUT
     PIPPIN SAID FRODO DIDNT YOU SAY THAT GANDALF WAS LESS CLOSE THAN OF OLD HE WAS WEARY OF HIS LABOURS THEN I THINK NOW HE IS RECOVERING
     AND GANDALF SAID MANY FOLK LIKE TO KNOW BEFOREHAND WHAT IS TO BE SET ON THE TABLE BUT THOSE WHO HAVE LABOURED TO PREPARE THE FEAST LIKE TO KEEP THEIR SECRET FOR WONDER MAKES THE WORDS OF PRAISE LOUDER AND ARAGORN HIMSELF WAITS FOR A SIGN
     THERE CAME A DAY WHEN GANDALF COULD NOT BE FOUND AND THE COMPANIONS WONDERED WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD BUT GANDALF TOOK ARAGORN OUT FROM THE CITY BY NIGHT AND HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE SOUTHERN FEET OF MOUNT MINDOLLUIN AND THERE THEY FOUND A PATH MADE IN AGES PAST THAT FEW NOW DARED TO TREAD FOR IT LED UP ON TO THE MOUNTAIN TO A HIGH HALLOW WHERE ONLY THE KINGS HAD BEEN WONT TO GO AND THEY WENT UP BY STEEP WAYS UNTIL THEY CAME TO A HIGH FIELD BELOW THE SNOWS THAT CLAD THE LOFTY PEAKS AND IT LOOKED DOWN OVER THE PRECIPICE THAT STOOD BEHIND THE CITY AND STANDING THERE THEY SURVEYED THE LANDS FOR THE MORNING WAS COME AND THEY SAW THE TOWERS OF THE CITY FAR BELOW THEM LIKE WHITE PENCILS TOUCHED BY THE SUNLIGHT AND ALL THE VALE OF ANDUIN WAS LIKE A GARDEN AND THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW WERE VEILED IN A GOLDEN MIST UPON THE ONE SIDE THEIR SIGHT REACHED TO THE GREY EMYN MUIL AND THE GLINT OF RAUROS WAS LIKE A STAR TWINKLING FAR OFF AND UPON THE OTHER SIDE THEY SAW THE RIVER LIKE A RIBBON LAID DOWN TO PELARGIR AND BEYOND THAT WAS A LIGHT ON THE HEM OF THE SKY THAT SPOKE OF THE SEA
     AND GANDALF SAID THIS IS YOUR REALM AND THE HEART OF THE GREATER REALM THAT SHALL BE THE THIRD AGE OF THE WORLD IS ENDED AND THE NEW AGE IS BEGUN AND IT IS YOUR TASK TO ORDER ITS BEGINNING AND TO PRESERVE WHAT MAY BE PRESERVED FOR THOUGH MUCH HAS BEEN SAVED MUCH MUST NOW PASS AWAY AND THE POWER OF THE THREE RINGS ALSO IS ENDED AND ALL THE LANDS THAT YOU SEE AND THOSE THAT LIE ROUND ABOUT THEM SHALL BE DWELLINGS OF MEN FOR THE TIME COMES OF THE DOMINION OF MEN AND THE ELDER KINDRED SHALL FADE OR DEPART
     I KNOW IT WELL DEAR FRIEND SAID ARAGORN BUT I WOULD STILL HAVE YOUR COUNSEL
     NOT FOR LONG NOW SAID GANDALF THE THIRD AGE WAS MY AGE I WAS THE ENEMY OF SAURON AND MY WORK IS FINISHED I SHALL GO SOON THE BURDEN MUST LIE NOW UPON YOU AND YOUR KINDRED
     BUT I SHALL DIE SAID ARAGORN FOR I AM A MORTAL MAN AND THOUGH BEING WHAT I AM AND OF THE RACE OF THE WEST UNMINGLED I SHALL HAVE LIFE FAR LONGER THAN OTHER MEN YET THAT IS BUT A LITTLE WHILE AND WHEN THOSE WHO ARE NOW IN THE WOMBS OF WOMEN ARE BORN AND HAVE GROWN OLD I TOO SHALL GROW OLD AND WHO THEN SHALL GOVERN GONDOR AND THOSE WHO LOOK TO THIS CITY AS TO THEIR QUEEN IF MY DESIRE BE NOT GRANTED THE TREE IN THE COURT OF THE FOUNTAIN IS STILL WITHERED AND BARREN WHEN SHALL I SEE A SIGN THAT IT WILL EVER BE OTHERWISE
     TURN YOUR FACE FROM THE GREEN WORLD AND LOOK WHERE ALL SEEMS BARREN AND COLD SAID GANDALF
     THEN ARAGORN TURNED AND THERE WAS A STONY SLOPE BEHIND HIM RUNNING DOWN FROM THE SKIRTS OF THE SNOW AND AS HE LOOKED HE WAS AWARE THAT ALONE THERE IN THE WASTE A GROWING THING STOOD AND HE CLIMBED TO IT AND SAW THAT OUT OF THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW THERE SPRANG A SAPLING TREE NO MORE THAN THREE FOOT HIGH ALREADY IT HAD PUT FORTH YOUNG LEAVES LONG AND SHAPELY DARK ABOVE AND SILVER BENEATH AND UPON ITS SLENDER CROWN IT BORE ONE SMALL CLUSTER OF FLOWERS WHOSE WHITE PETALS SHONE LIKE THE SUNLIT SNOW
     THEN ARAGORN CRIED Y I HAVE FOUND IT LO HERE IS A SCION OF THE ELDEST OF TREES BUT HOW COMES IT HERE FOR IT IS NOT ITSELF YET SEVEN YEARS OLD
     AND GANDALF COMING LOOKED AT IT AND SAID VERILY THIS IS A SAPLING OF THE LINE OF NIMLOTH THE FAIR AND THAT WAS A SEEDLING OF GALATHILION AND THAT A FRUIT OF TELPERION OF MANY NAMES ELDEST OF TREES WHO SHALL SAY HOW IT COMES HERE IN THE APPOINTED HOUR BUT THIS IS AN ANCIENT HALLOW AND ERE THE KINGS FAILED OR THE TREE WITHERED IN THE COURT A FRUIT MUST HAVE BEEN SET HERE FOR IT IS SAID THAT THOUGH THE FRUIT OF THE TREE COMES SELDOM TO RIPENESS YET THE LIFE WITHIN MAY THEN LIE SLEEPING THROUGH MANY LONG YEARS AND NONE CAN FORETELL THE TIME IN WHICH IT WILL AWAKE REMEMBER THIS FOR IF EVER A FRUIT RIPENS IT SHOULD BE PLANTED LEST THE LINE DIE OUT OF THE WORLD HERE IT HAS LAIN HIDDEN ON THE MOUNTAIN EVEN AS THE RACE OF ELENDIL LAY HIDDEN IN THE WASTES OF THE NORTH YET THE LINE OF NIMLOTH IS OLDER FAR THAN YOUR LINE KING ELESSAR
     THEN ARAGORN LAID HIS HAND GENTLY TO THE SAPLING AND LO IT SEEMED TO HOLD ONLY LIGHTLY TO THE EARTH AND IT WAS REMOVED WITHOUT HURT AND ARAGORN BORE IT BACK TO THE CITADEL THEN THE WITHERED TREE WAS UPROOTED BUT WITH REVERENCE AND THEY DID NOT BURN IT BUT LAID IT TO REST IN THE SILENCE OF RATH D
     
     THE SIGN HAS BEEN GIVEN SAID ARAGORN AND THE DAY IS NOT FAR OFF AND HE SET WATCHMEN UPON THE WALLS
     IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE MIDSUMMER WHEN MESSENGERS CAME FROM AMON D
     UPON THE VERY EVE OF MIDSUMMER WHEN THE SKY WAS BLUE AS SAPPHIRE AND WHITE STARS OPENED IN THE EAST BUT THE WEST WAS STILL GOLDEN AND THE AIR WAS COOL AND FRAGRANT THE RIDERS CAME DOWN THE NORTHWAY TO THE GATES OF MINAS TIRITH FIRST RODE ELROHIR AND ELLADAN WITH A BANNER OF SILVER AND THEN CAME GLORFINDEL AND ERESTOR AND ALL THE HOUSEHOLD OF RIVENDELL AND AFTER THEM CAME THE LADY GALADRIEL AND CELEBORN LORD OF LOTHL
     AND FRODO WHEN HE SAW HER COME GLIMMERING IN THE EVENING WITH STARS ON HER BROW AND A SWEET FRAGRANCE ABOUT HER WAS MOVED WITH GREAT WONDER AND HE SAID TO GANDALF AT LAST I UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE WAITED THIS IS THE ENDING NOW NOT DAY ONLY SHALL BE BELOVED BUT NIGHT TOO SHALL BE BEAUTIFUL AND BLESSED AND ALL ITS FEAR PASS AWAY
     THEN THE KING WELCOMED HIS GUESTS AND THEY ALIGHTED AND ELROND SURRENDERED THE SCEPTRE AND LAID THE HAND OF HIS DAUGHTER IN THE HAND OF THE KING AND TOGETHER THEY WENT UP INTO THE HIGH CITY AND ALL THE STARS FLOWERED IN THE SKY AND ARAGORN THE KING ELESSAR WEDDED ARWEN UND
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 6
      MANY PARTINGS
     

     WHEN THE DAYS OF REJOICING WERE OVER AT LAST THE COMPANIONS THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FRODO WENT TO THE KING AS HE WAS SITTING WITH THE QUEEN ARWEN BY THE FOUNTAIN AND SHE SANG A SONG OF VALINOR WHILE THE TREE GREW AND BLOSSOMED THEY WELCOMED FRODO AND ROSE TO GREET HIM AND ARAGORN SAID
     I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO SAY FRODO YOU WISH TO RETURN TO YOUR OWN HOME WELL DEAREST FRIEND THE TREE GROWS BEST IN THE LAND OF ITS SIRES BUT FOR YOU IN ALL THE LANDS OF THE WEST THERE WILL EVER BE A WELCOME AND THOUGH YOUR PEOPLE HAVE HAD LITTLE FAME IN THE LEGENDS OF THE GREAT THEY WILL NOW HAVE MORE RENOWN THAN ANY WIDE REALMS THAT ARE NO MORE
     IT IS TRUE THAT I WISH TO GO BACK TO THE SHIRE SAID FRODO BUT FIRST I MUST GO TO RIVENDELL FOR IF THERE COULD BE ANYTHING WANTING IN A TIME SO BLESSED I MISSED BILBO AND I WAS GRIEVED WHEN AMONG ALL THE HOUSEHOLD OF ELROND I SAW THAT HE WAS NOT COME
     DO YOU WONDER AT THAT RINGBEARER SAID ARWEN FOR YOU KNOW THE POWER OF THAT THING WHICH IS NOW DESTROYED AND ALL THAT WAS DONE BY THAT POWER IS NOW PASSING AWAY BUT YOUR KINSMAN POSSESSED THIS THING LONGER THAN YOU HE IS ANCIENT IN YEARS NOW ACCORDING TO HIS KIND AND HE AWAITS YOU FOR HE WILL NOT AGAIN MAKE ANY LONG JOURNEY SAVE ONE
     THEN I BEG LEAVE TO DEPART SOON SAID FRODO
     IN SEVEN DAYS WE WILL GO SAID ARAGORN FOR WE SHALL RIDE WITH YOU FAR ON THE ROAD EVEN AS FAR AS THE COUNTRY OF ROHAN IN THREE DAYS NOW NY GIFTS THAT I COULD GIVE TO MATCH WITH YOUR DEEDS YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM BUT WHATEVER YOU DESIRE YOU SHALL TAKE WITH YOU AND YOU SHALL RIDE IN HONOUR AND ARRAYED AS PRINCES OF THE LAND
     BUT THE QUEEN ARWEN SAID A GIFT I WILL GIVE YOU FOR I AM THE DAUGHTER OF ELROND I SHALL NOT GO WITH HIM NOW WHEN HE DEPARTS TO THE HAVENS FOR MINE IS THE CHOICE OF LARE HEALED BUT WEAR THIS NOW IN MEMORY OF ELFSTONE AND EVENSTAR WITH WHOM YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN WOVEN
     AND SHE TOOK A WHITE GEM LIKE A STAR THAT LAY UPON HER BREAST HANGING UPON A SILVER CHAIN AND SHE SET THE CHAIN ABOUT FRODOS NECK WHEN THE MEMORY OF THE FEAR AND THE DARKNESS TROUBLES YOU SHE SAID THIS WILL BRING YOU AID
     IN THREE DAYS AS THE KING HAD SAID  OF THE FAIREST KNIGHTS OF THE MARK HE WAS WELCOMED AND WHEN THEY SAT ALL AT TABLE IN MERETHROND THE GREAT HALL OF FEASTS HE BEHELD THE BEAUTY OF THE LADIES THAT HE SAW AND WAS FILLED WITH GREAT WONDER AND BEFORE HE WENT TO HIS REST HE SENT FOR GIMLI THE DWARF AND HE SAID TO HIM GIMLI GL
     NAY LORD SAID GIMLI BUT I CAN SPEEDILY FETCH IT IF THERE BE NEED
     YOU SHALL JUDGE SAID 
     WELL LORD SAID GIMLI AND WHAT SAY YOU NOW
     ALAS SAID 
     THEN I MUST GO FOR MY AXE SAID GIMLI
     BUT FIRST I WILL PLEAD THIS EXCUSE SAID 
     THEN GIMLI BOWED LOW NAY YOU ARE EXCUSED FOR MY PART LORD HE SAID YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE EVENING BUT MY LOVE IS GIVEN TO THE MORNING AND MY HEART FOREBODES THAT SOON IT WILL PAST AWAY FOR EVER
     AT LAST THE DAY OF DEPARTURE CAME AND A GREAT AND FAIR COMPANY MADE READY TO RIDE NORTH FROM THE CITY THEN THE KINGS OF GONDOR AND ROHAN WENT TO THE HALLOWS AND THEY CAME TO THE TOMBS IN RATH D
     FOR THE OTHER COMPANIONS STEEDS WERE FURNISHED ACCORDING TO THEIR STATURE AND FRODO AND SAMWISE RODE AT ARAGORNS SIDE AND GANDALF RODE UPON SHADOWFAX AND PIPPIN RODE WITH THE KNIGHTS OF GONDOR AND LEGOLAS AND GIMLI AS EVER RODE TOGETHER UPON AROD
     IN THAT RIDING WENT ALSO QUEEN ARWEN AND CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL WITH THEIR FOLK AND ELROND AND HIS SONS AND THE PRINCES OF DOL AMROTH AND OF ITHILIEN AND MANY CAPTAINS AND KNIGHTS NEVER HAD ANY KING OF THE MARK SUCH COMPANY UPON THE ROAD AS WENT WITH TH

     BEHOLD THE KING ELESSAR IS COME THE FOREST OF DRUADAN HE GIVES TO GHANBURIGHAN AND TO HIS FOLK TO BE THEIR OWN FOR EVER AND HEREAFTER LET NO MAN ENTER IT WITHOUT THEIR LEAVE
     THEN THE DRUMS ROLLED LOUDLY AND WERE SILENT
     AT LENGTH AFTER FIFTEEN DAYS OF JOURNEY THE WAIN OF KING THPREPARED THE FUNERAL OF TH
     THEN THE RIDERS OF THE KINGS HOUSE UPON WHITE HORSES RODE ROUND ABOUT THE BARROW AND SANG TOGETHER A SONG OF TH THUNDER OF THE HOOVES OF THE NORTH AND THE VOICE OF EORL CRYING ABOVE THE BATTLE UPON THE FIELD OF CELEBRANT AND THE TALE OF THE KINGS ROLLED ON AND THE HORN OF HELM WAS LOUD IN THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL THE DARKNESS CAME AND KING THENDOUR EVEN AS THE SUN RETURNING BEYOND HOPE GLEAMED UPON MINDOLLUIN IN THE MORNING
     
      
       OUT OF DOUBT OUT OF DARK TO THE DAYS RISING

       HE RODE SINGING IN THE SUN SWORD UNSHEATHING

       HOPE HE REKINDLED AND IN HOPE ENDED

       OVER DEATH OVER DREAD OVER DOOM LIFTED

       OUT OF LOSS OUT OF LIFE UNTO LONG GLORY

      

     
     BUT MERRY STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE GREEN MOUND AND HE WEPT AND WHEN THE SONG WAS ENDED HE AROSE AND CRIED
     TH
     WHEN THE BURIAL WAS OVER AND THE WEEPING OF WOMEN WAS STILLED AND THMEMORY OF THE KINGS

     THEN 
     AND HE ANSWERED I HAVE WISHED THEE JOY EVER SINCE FIRST I SAW THEE IT HEALS MY HEART TO SEE THEE NOW IN BLISS
     WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER THOSE WHO WERE TO GO TOOK LEAVE OF KING THERE SPOKE LONG TOGETHER AND BITTER WAS THEIR PARTING THAT SHOULD ENDURE BEYOND THE ENDS OF THE WORLD
     AT THE LAST BEFORE THE GUESTS SET OAT 
     AND S SMALL THING AS A MEMORIAL OF DERNHELM AND OF THE HORNS OF THE MARK AT THE COMING OF THE MORNING
     THEN 
     THIS IS AN HEIRLOOM OF OUR HOUSE SAID 
     THEN MERRY TOOK THE HORN FOR IT COULD NOT BE REFUSED AND HE KISSED 
     NOW THE GUESTS WERE READY AND THEY DRANK THE STIRRUPCUP AND WITH GREAT PRAISE AND FRIENDSHIP THEY DEPARTED AND CAME AT LENGTH TO HELMS DEEP AND THERE THEY RESTED TWO DAYS THEN LEGOLAS REPAID HIS PROMISE TO GIMLI AND WENT WITH HIM TO THE GLITTERING CAVES AND WHEN THEY RETURNED HE WAS SILENT AND WOULD SAY ONLY THAT GIMLI ALONE COULD FIND FIT WORDS TO SPEAK OF THEM AND NEVER BEFORE HAS A DWARF CLAIMED A VICTORY OVER AN ELF IN A CONTEST OF WORDS SAID HE NOW THEREFORE LET US GO TO FANGORN AND SET THE SCORE RIGHT
     FROM DEEPINGCOOMB THEY RODE TO ISENGARD AND SAW HOW THE ENTS HAD BUSIED THEMSELVES ALL THE STONECIRCLE HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN AND REMOVED AND THE LAND WITHIN WAS MADE INTO A GARDEN FILLED WITH ORCHARDS AND TREES AND A STREAM RAN THROUGH IT BUT IN THE MIDST OF ALL THERE WAS A LAKE OF CLEAR WATER AND OUT OF IT THE TOWER OF ORTHANC ROSE STILL TALL AND IMPREGNABLE AND ITS BLACK ROCK WAS MIRRORED IN THE POOL
     FOR A WHILE THE TRAVELLERS SAT WHERE ONCE THE OLD GATES OF ISENGARD HAD STOOD AND THERE WERE NOW TWO TALL TREES LIKE SENTINELS AT THE BEGINNING OF A GREENBORDERED PATH THAT RAN TOWARDS ORTHANC AND THEY LOOKED IN WONDER AT THE WORK THAT HAD BEEN DONE BUT NO LIVING THING COULD THEY SEE FAR OR NEAR BUT PRESENTLY THEY HEARD A VOICE CALLING HOOMHOM HOOMHOM AND THERE CAME TREEBEARD STRIDING DOWN THE PATH TO GREET THEM WITH QUICKBEAM AT HIS SIDE
     WELCOME TO THE TREEGARTH OF ORTHANC HE SAID I KNEW THAT YOU WERE COMING BUT I WAS AT WORK UP THE VALLEY THERE IS MUCH STILL TO BE DONE BUT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN IDLE EITHER AWAY IN THE SOUTH AND THE EAST I HEAR AND ALL THAT I HEAR IS GOOD VERY GOOD THEN TREEBEARD PRAISED ALL THEIR DEEDS OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE AND AT LAST HE STOPPED AND LOOKED LONG AT GANDALF
     WELL COME NOW HE SAID YOU HAVE PROVED MIGHTIEST AND ALL YOUR LABOURS HAVE GONE WELL WHERE NOW WOULD YOU BE GOING AND WHY DO YOU COME HERE

     THEN WHY DID HE STAY TO LISTEN DID YOU GO INTO ORTHANC ASKED GANDALF
     HOOM NO NOT INTO ORTHANC SAID TREEBEARD BUT HE CAME TO HIS WINDOW AND LISTENED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT GET NEWS IN ANY OTHER WAY AND THOUGH HE HATED THE NEWS HE WAS GREEDY TO HAVE IT AND I SAW THAT HE HEARD IT ALL BUT I ADDED A GREAT MANY THINGS TO THE NEWS THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR HIM TO THINK OF HE GREW VERY WEARY HE ALWAYS WAS HASTY THAT WAS HIS RUIN

     THAT WILL BE SEEN LATER SAID ARAGORN BUT I WILL GIVE TO ENTS ALL THIS VALLEY TO DO WITH AS THEY WILL SO LONG AS THEY KEEP A WATCH UPON ORTHANC AND SEE THAT NONE ENTER IT WITHOUT MY LEAVE
     IT IS LOCKED SAID TREEBEARD I MADE SARUMAN LOCK IT AND GIVE ME THE KEYS QUICKBEAM HAS THEM
     QUICKBEAM BOWED LIKE A TREE BENDING IN THE WIND AND HANDED TO ARAGORN TWO GREAT BLACK KEYS OF INTRICATE SHAPE JOINED BY A RING OF STEEL NOW I THANK YOU ONCE MORE SAID ARAGORN AND I BID YOU FAREWELL MAY YOUR FOREST GROW AGAIN IN PEACE WHEN THIS VALLEY IS FILLED THERE IS ROOM AND TO SPARE WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS WHERE ONCE YOU WALKED LONG AGO
     TREEBEARDS FACE BECAME SAD FORESTS MAY GROW HE SAID WOODS MAY SPREAD BUT NOT ENTS THERE ARE NO ENTINGS
     YET MAYBE THERE IS NOW MORE HOPE IN YOUR SEARCH SAID ARAGORN LANDS WILL LIE OPEN TO YOU EASTWARD THAT HAVE LONG BEEN CLOSED
     BUT TREEBEARD SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID IT IS FAR TO GO AND THERE ARE TOO MANY MEN THERE IN THESE DAYS BUT I AM FORGETTING MY MANNERS WILL YOU STAY HERE AND REST A WHILE AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME THAT WOULD BE PLEASED TO PASS THROUGH FANGORN FOREST AND SO SHORTEN THEIR ROAD HOME HE LOOKED AT CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL
     BUT ALL SAVE LEGOLAS SAID THAT THEY MUST NOW TAKE THEIR LEAVE AND DEPART EITHER SOUTH OR WEST COME GIMLI SAID LEGOLAS NOW BY FANGORNS LEAVE I WILL VISIT THE DEEP PLACES OF THE ENTWOOD AND SEE SUCH TREES AS ARE NOWHERE ELSE TO BE FOUND IN MIDDLEEARTH YOU SHALL COME WITH ME AND KEEP YOUR WORD AND THUS WE WILL JOURNEY ON TOGETHER TO OUR OWN LANDS IN MIRKWOOD AND BEYOND TO THIS GIMLI AGREED THOUGH WITH NO GREAT DELIGHT IT SEEMED
     HERE THEN AT LAST COMES THE ENDING OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING SAID ARAGORN YET I HOPE THAT ERE LONG YOU WILL RETURN TO MY LAND WITH THE HELP THAT YOU PROMISED
     WE WILL COME IF OUR OWN LORDS ALLOW IT SAID GIMLI WELL FAREWELL MY HOBBITS YOU SHOULD COME SAFE TO YOUR OWN HOMES NOW AND I SHALL NOT BE KEPT AWAKE FOR FEAR OF YOUR PERIL WE WILL SEND WORD WHEN WE MAY AND SOME OF US MAY YET MEET AT TIMES BUT I FEAR THAT WE SHALL NOT ALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER EVER AGAIN
     THEN TREEBEARD SAID FAREWELL TO EACH OF THEM IN TURN AND HE BOWED THREE TIMES SLOWLY AND WITH GREAT REVERENCE TO CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL IT IS LONG LONG SINCE WE MET BY STOCK OR BY STONE A VANIMAR VANIMALIONNOSTARI HE SAID IT IS SAD THAT WE SHOULD MEET ONLY THUS AT THE ENDING FOR THE WORLD IS CHANGING I FEEL IT IN THE WATER I FEEL IT IN THE EARTH AND I SMELL IT IN THE AIR I DO NOT THINK WE SHALL MEET AGAIN
     AND CELEBORN SAID I DO NOT KNOW ELDEST BUT GALADRIEL SAID NOT IN MIDDLEEARTH NOR UNTIL THE LANDS THAT LIE UNDER THE WAVE ARE LIFTED UP AGAIN THEN IN THE WILLOWMEADS OF TASARINAN WE MAY MEET IN THE SPRING FAREWELL
     LAST OF ALL MERRY AND PIPPIN SAID GOODBYE TO THE OLD ENT AND HE GREW GAYER AS HE LOOKED AT THEM WELL MY MERRY FOLK HE SAID WILL YOU DRINK ANOTHER DRAUGHT WITH ME BEFORE YOU GO
     INDEED WE WILL THEY SAID AND HE TOOK THEM ASIDE INTO THE SHADE OF ONE OF THE TREES AND THERE THEY SAW THAT A GREAT STONE JAR HAD BEEN SET AND TREEBEARD FILLED THREE BOWLS AND THEY DRANK AND THEY SAW HIS STRANGE EYES LOOKING AT THEM OVER THE RIM OF HIS BOWL TAKE CARE TAKE CARE HE SAID FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY GROWN SINCE I SAW YOU LAST AND THEY LAUGHED AND DRAINED THEIR BOWLS
     WELL GOODBYE HE SAID AND DONT FORGET THAT IF YOU HEAR ANY NEWS OF THE ENTWIVES IN YOUR LAND YOU WILL SEND WORD TO ME THEN HE WAVED HIS GREAT HANDS TO ALL THE COMPANY AND WENT OFF INTO THE TREES
     THE TRAVELLERS NOW RODE WITH MORE SPEED AND THEY MADE THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE GAP OF ROHAN AND ARAGORN TOOK LEAVE OF THEM AT LAST CLOSE TO THAT VERY PLACE WHERE PIPPIN HAD LOOKED INTO THE STONE OF ORTHANC THE HOBBITS WERE GRIEVED AT THIS PARTING FOR ARAGORN HAD NEVER FAILED THEM AND HE HAD BEEN THEIR GUIDE THROUGH MANY PERILS
     I WISH WE COULD HAVE A STONE THAT WE COULD SEE ALL OUR FRIENDS IN SAID PIPPIN AND THAT WE COULD SPEAK TO THEM FROM FAR AWAY
     ONLY ONE NOW REMAINS THAT YOU COULD USE ANSWERED ARAGORN FOR YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE WHAT THE STONE OF MINAS TIRITH WOULD SHOW YOU BUT THE PALANTSHIRE THAT MY REALM LIES ALSO IN THE NORTH AND I SHALL COME THERE ONE DAY
     THEN ARAGORN TOOK LEAVE OF CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL AND THE LADY SAID TO HIM ELFSTONE THROUGH DARKNESS YOU HAVE COME TO YOUR HOPE AND HAVE NOW ALL YOUR DESIRE USE WELL THE DAYS
     BUT CELEBORN SAID KINSMAN FAREWELL MAY YOUR DOOM BE OTHER THAN MINE AND YOUR TREASURE REMAIN WITH YOU TO THE END
     WITH THAT THEY PARTED AND IT WAS THEN THE TIME OF SUNSET AND WHEN AFTER A WHILE THEY TURNED AND LOOKED BACK THEY SAW THE KING OF THE WEST SITTING UPON HIS HORSE WITH HIS KNIGHTS ABOUT HIM AND THE FALLING SUN SHONE UPON THEM AND MADE ALL THEIR HARNESS TO GLEAM LIKE RED GOLD AND THE WHITE MANTLE OF ARAGORN WAS TURNED TO A FLAME THEN ARAGORN TOOK THE GREEN STONE AND HELD IT UP AND THERE CAME A GREEN FIRE FROM HIS HAND
     SOON THE DWINDLING COMPANY FOLLOWING THE ISEN TURNED WEST AND RODE THROUGH THE GAP INTO THE WASTE LANDS BEYOND AND THEN THEY TURNED NORTHWARDS AND PASSED OVER THE BORDERS OF DUNLAND THE DUNLENDINGS FLED AND HID THEMSELVES FOR THEY WERE AFRAID OF ELVISH FOLK THOUGH FEW INDEED EVER CAME TO THEIR COUNTRY BUT THE TRAVELLERS DID NOT HEED THEM FOR THEY WERE STILL A GREAT COMPANY AND WERE WELL PROVIDED WITH ALL THAT THEY NEEDED AND THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY AT THEIR LEISURE SETTING UP THEIR TENTS WHEN THEY WOULD
     ON THE SIXTH DAY SINCE THEIR PARTING FROM THE KING THEY JOURNEYED THROUGH A WOOD CLIMBING DOWN FROM THE HILLS AT THE FEET OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS THAT NOW MARCHED ON THEIR RIGHT HAND AS THEY CAME OUT AGAIN INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY AT SUNDOWN THEY OVERTOOK AN OLD MAN LEANING ON A STAFF AND HE WAS CLOTHED IN RAGS OF GREY OR DIRTY WHITE AND AT HIS HEELS WENT ANOTHER BEGGAR SLOUCHING AND WHINING
     WELL SARUMAN SAID GANDALF WHERE ARE YOU GOING
     WHAT IS THAT TO YOU HE ANSWERED WILL YOU STILL ORDER MY GOINGS AND ARE YOU NOT CONTENT WITH MY RUIN
     YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS SAID GANDALF NO AND NO BUT IN ANY CASE THE TIME OF MY LABOURS NOW DRAWS TO AN END THE KING HAS TAKEN ON THE BURDEN IF YOU HAD WAITED AT ORTHANC YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE SHOWN YOU WISDOM AND MERCY
     THEN ALL THE A MORE REASON TO HAVE LEFT SOONER SAID SARUMAN FOR I DESIRE NEITHER OF HIM INDEED IF YOU WISH FOR AN ANSWER TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION I AM SEEKING A WAY OUT OF HIS REALM
     THEN ONCE MORE YOU ARE GOING THE WRONG WAY SAID GANDALF AND I SEE NO HOPE IN YOUR JOURNEY BUT WILL YOU SCORN OUR HELP FOR WE OFFER IT TO YOU
     TO ME SAID SARUMAN NAY PRAY DO NOT SMILE AT ME I PREFER YOUR FROWNS AND AS FOR THE LADY HERE I DO NOT TRUST HER SHE ALWAYS HATED ME AND SCHEMED FOR YOUR PART I DO NOT DOUBT THAT SHE HAS BROUGHT YOU THIS WAY TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF GLOATING OVER MY POVERTY HAD I BEEN WARNED OF YOUR PURSUIT I WOULD HAVE DENIED YOU THE PLEASURE
     SARUMAN SAID GALADRIEL WE HAVE OTHER ERRANDS AND OTHER CARES THAT SEEM TO US MORE URGENT THAN HUNTING FOR YOU SAY RATHER THAT YOU ARE OVERTAKEN BY GOOD FORTUNE FOR NOW YOU HAVE A LAST CHANCE
     IF IT BE TRULY THE LAST I AM GLAD SAID SARUMAN FOR I SHALL BE SPARED THE TROUBLE OF REFUSING IT AGAIN ALL MY HOPES ARE RUINED BUT I WOULD NOT SHARE YOURS IF YOU HAVE ANY
     FOR A MOMENT HIS EYES KINDLED GO HE SAID I DID NOT SPEND LONG STUDY ON THESE MATTERS FOR NAUGHT YOU HAVE DOOMED YOURSELVES AND YOU KNOW IT AND IT WILL AFFORD ME SOME COMFORT AS I WANDER TO THINK THAT YOU PULLED DOWN YOUR OWN HOUSE WHEN YOU DESTROYED MINE AND NOW WHAT SHIP WILL BEAR YOU BACK ACROSS SO WIDE A SEA HE MOCKED IT WILL BE A GREY SHIP AND FULL OF GHOSTS HE LAUGHED BUT HIS VOICE WAS CRACKED AND HIDEOUS
     GET UP YOU IDIOT HE SHOUTED TO THE OTHER BEGGAR WHO HAD SAT DOWN ON THE GROUND AND HE STRUCK HIM WITH HIS STAFF TURN ABOUT IF THESE FINE FOLK ARE GOING OUR WAY THEN WE WILL TAKE ANOTHER GET ON OR ILL GIVE YOU NO CRUST FOR YOUR SUPPER
     THE BEGGAR TURNED AND SLOUCHED PAST WHIMPERING POOR OLD GR
     THEN LEAVE HIM SAID GANDALF
     BUT WORMTONGUE ONLY SHOT A GLANCE OF HIS BLEARED EYES FULL OF TERROR AT GANDALF AND THEN SHUFFLED QUICKLY PAST BEHIND SARUMAN AS THE WRETCHED PAIR PASSED BY THE COMPANY THEY CAME TO THE HOBBITS AND SARUMAN STOPPED AND STARED AT THEM BUT THEY LOOKED AT HIM WITH PITY
     SO YOU HAVE COME TO GLOAT TOO HAVE YOU MY URCHINS HE SAID YOU DONT CARE WHAT A BEGGAR LACKS DO YOU FOR YOU HAVE ALL YOU WANT FOOD AND FINE CLOTHES AND THE BEST WEED FOR YOUR PIPES OH YES I KNOW I KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM YOU WOULD NOT GIVE A PIPEFUL TO A BEGGAR WOULD YOU
     I WOULD IF I HAD ANY SAID FRODO
     YOU CAN HAVE WHAT I HAVE GOT LEFT SAID MERRY IF YOU WILL WAIT A MOMENT HE GOT DOWN AND SEARCHED IN THE BAG AT HIS SADDLE THEN HE HANDED TO SARUMAN A LEATHER POUCH TAKE WHAT THERE IS HE SAID YOU ARE WELCOME TO IT IT CAME FROM THE FLOTSAM OF ISENGARD
     MINE MINE YES AND DEARLY BOUGHT CRIED SARUMAN CLUTCHING AT THE POUCH THIS IS ONLY A REPAYMENT IN TOKEN FOR YOU TOOK MORE ILL BE BOUND STILL A BEGGAR MUST BE GRATEFUL IF A THIEF RETURNS HIM EVEN A MORSEL OF HIS OWN WELL IT WILL SERVE YOU RIGHT WHEN YOU COME HOME IF YOU FIND THINGS LESS GOOD IN THE SOUTHFARTHING THAN YOU WOULD LIKE LONG MAY YOUR LAND BE SHORT OF LEAF
     THANK YOU SAID MERRY IN THAT CASE I WILL HAVE MY POUCH BACK WHICH IS NOT YOURS AND HAS JOURNEYED FAR WITH ME WRAP THE WEED IN A RAG OF YOUR OWN
     ONE THIEF DESERVES ANOTHER SAID SARUMAN AND TURNED HIS BACK ON MERRY AND KICKED WORMTONGUE AND WENT AWAY TOWARDS THE WOOD

     AH SAID SAM AND BOUGHT HE SAID HOW I WONDER AND I DIDNT LIKE THE SOUND OF WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE SOUTHFARTHING ITS TIME WE GOT BACK
     IM SURE IT IS SAID FRODO BUT WE CANT GO ANY QUICKER IF WE ARE TO SEE BILBO I AM GOING TO RIVENDELL FIRST WHATEVER HAPPENS
     YES I THINK YOU HAD BETTER DO THAT SAID GANDALF BUT ALAS FOR SARUMAN I FEAR NOTHING MORE CAN BE MADE OF HIM HE HAS WITHERED ALTOGETHER ALL THE SAME I AM NOT SURE THAT TREEBEARD IS RIGHT I FANCY HE COULD DO SOME MISCHIEF STILL IN A SMALL MEAN WAY
     NEXT DAY THEY WENT ON INTO NORTHERN DUNLAND WHERE NO MEN NOW DWELT THOUGH IT WAS A GREEN AND PLEASANT COUNTRY SEPTEMBER CAME IN WITH GOLDEN DAYS AND SILVER NIGHTS AND THEY RODE AT EASE UNTIL THEY REACHED THE SWANFLEET RIVER AND FOUND THE OLD FORD EAST OF THE FALLS WHERE IT WENT DOWN SUDDENLY INTO THE LOWLANDS FAR TO THE WEST IN A HAZE LAY THE MERES AND EYOTS THROUGH WHICH IT WOUND ITS WAY TO THE GREYFLOOD THERE COUNTLESS SWANS HOUSED IN A LAND OF REEDS
     SO THEY PASSED INTO EREGION AND AT LAST A FAIR MORNING DAWNED SHIMMERING ABOVE GLEAMING MISTS AND LOOKING FROM THEIR CAMP ON A LOW HILL THE TRAVELLERS SAW AWAY IN THE EAST THE SUN CATCHING THREE PEAKS THAT THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THROUGH FLOATING CLOUDS CARADHRAS CELEBDIL AND FANUIDHOL THEY WERE NEAR TO THE GATES OF MORIA
     HERE NOW FOR SEVEN DAYS THEY TARRIED FOR THE TIME WAS AT HAND FOR ANOTHER PARTING WHICH THEY WERE LOTH TO MAKE SOON CELEBORN AND GALADRIEL AND THEIR FOLK WOULD TURN EASTWARD AND SO PASS BY THE REDHORN GATE AND DOWN THE DIMRILL STAIR TO THE SILVERLODE AND TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEY HAD JOURNEYED THUS FAR BY THE WESTWAYS FOR THEY HAD MUCH TO SPEAK OF WITH ELROND AND WITH GANDALF AND HERE THEY LINGERED STILL IN CONVERSE WITH THEIR FRIENDS OFTEN LONG AFTER THE HOBBITS WERE WRAPPED IN SLEEP THEY WOULD SIT TOGETHER UNDER THE STARS RECALLING THE AGES THAT WERE GONE AND ALL THEIR JOYS AND LABOURS IN THE WORLD OR HOLDING COUNCIL CONCERNING THE DAYS TO COME IF ANY WANDERER HAD CHANCED TO PASS LITTLE WOULD HE HAVE SEEN OR HEARD AND IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HIM ONLY THAT HE SAW GREY FIGURES CARVED IN STONE MEMORIALS OF FORGOTTEN THINGS NOW LOST IN UNPEOPLED LANDS FOR THEY DID NOT MOVE OR SPEAK WITH MOUTH LOOKING FROM MIND TO MIND AND ONLY THEIR SHINING EYES STIRRED AND KINDLED AS THEIR THOUGHTS WENT TO AND FRO
     BUT AT LENGTH ALL WAS SAID AND THEY PARTED AGAIN FOR A WHILE UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR THE THREE RINGS TO PASS AWAY QUICKLY FADING INTO THE STONES AND THE SHADOWS THE GREYCLOAKED PEOPLE OF L
     SAM TURNED AWAY AND SIGHED I WISH I WAS GOING BACK TO L
     AT LAST ONE EVENING THEY CAME OVER THE HIGH MOORS SUDDENLY AS TO TRAVELLERS IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO THE BRINK OF THE DEEP VALLEY OF RIVENDELL AND SAW FAR BELOW THE LAMPS SHINING IN ELRONDS HOUSE AND THEY WENT DOWN AND CROSSED THE BRIDGE AND CAME TO THE DOORS AND ALL THE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH LIGHT AND SONG FOR JOY AT ELRONDS HOMECOMING
     FIRST OF ALL BEFORE THEY HAD EATEN OR WASHED OR EVEN SHED THEIR CLOAKS THE HOBBITS WENT IN SEARCH OF BILBO THEY FOUND HIM ALL ALONE IN HIS LITTLE ROOM IT WAS LITTERED WITH PAPERS AND PENS AND PENCILS BUT BILBO WAS SITTING IN A CHAIR BEFORE A SMALL BRIGHT FIRE HE LOOKED VERY OLD BUT PEACEFUL AND SLEEPY
     
     HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED UP AS THEY CAME IN HULLO HULLO HE SAID SO YOUVE COME BACK AND TOMORROWS MY BIRTHDAY TOO HOW CLEVER OF YOU DO YOU KNOW I SHALL BE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYNINE AND IN ONE YEAR MORE IF I AM SPARED I SHALL EQUAL THE OLD TOOK I SHOULD LIKE TO BEAT HIM BUT WE SHALL SEE
     AFTER THE CELEBRATION OF BILBOS BIRTHDAY THE FOUR HOBBITS STAYED IN RIVENDELL FOR SOME DAYS AND THEY SAT MUCH WITH THEIR OLD FRIEND WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME NOW IN HIS ROOM EXCEPT AT MEALS FOR THESE HE WAS STILL VERY PUNCTUAL AS A RULE AND HE SELDOM FAILED TO WAKE UP IN TIME FOR THEM SITTING ROUND THE FIRE THEY TOLD HIM IN TURN ALL THAT THEY COULD REMEMBER OF THEIR JOURNEYS AND ADVENTURES AT FIRST HE PRETENDED TO TAKE SOME NOTES BUT HE OFTEN FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE WOKE HE WOULD SAY HOW SPLENDID HOW WONDERFUL BUT WHERE WERE WE THEN THEY WENT ON WITH THE STORY FROM THE POINT WHERE HE HAD BEGUN TO NOD
     THE ONLY PART THAT SEEMED REALLY TO ROUSE HIM AND HOLD HIS ATTENTION WAS THE ACCOUNT OF THE CROWNING AND MARRIAGE OF ARAGORN I WAS INVITED TO THE WEDDING OF COURSE HE SAID AND I HAVE WAITED FOR IT LONG ENOUGH BUT SOMEHOW WHEN IT CAME TO IT I FOUND I HAD SO MUCH TO DO HERE AND PACKING IS SUCH A BOTHER
     WHEN NEARLY A FORTNIGHT HAD PASSED FRODO LOOKED OUT OF HIS WINDOW AND SAW THAT THERE HAD BEEN A FROST IN THE NIGHT AND THE COBWEBS WERE LIKE WHITE NETS THEN SUDDENLY HE KNEW THAT HE MUST GO AND SAY GOODBYE TO BILBO THE WEATHER WAS STILL CALM AND FAIR AFTER ONE OF THE MOST LOVELY SUMMERS THAT PEOPLE COULD REMEMBER BUT OCTOBER HAD COME AND IT MUST BREAK SOON AND BEGIN TO RAIN AND BLOW AGAIN AND THERE WAS STILL A VERY LONG WAY TO GO YET IT WAS NOT REALLY THE THOUGHT OF THE WEATHER THAT STIRRED HIM HE HAD A FEELING THAT IT WAS TIME HE WENT BACK TO THE SHIRE SAM SHARED IT ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD SAID
     WELL MR FRODO WEVE BEEN FAR AND SEEN A DEAL AND YET I DONT THINK WEVE FOUND A BETTER PLACE THAN THIS THERES SOMETHING OF EVERYTHING HERE IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME THE SHIRE AND THE GOLDEN WOOD AND GONDOR AND KINGS HOUSES AND INNS AND MEADOWS AND MOUNTAINS ALL MIXED AND YET SOMEHOW I FEEL WE OUGHT TO BE GOING SOON IM WORRIED ABOUT MY GAFFER TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
     YES SOMETHING OF EVERYTHING SAM EXCEPT THE SEA FRODO HAD ANSWERED AND HE REPEATED IT NOW TO HIMSELF EXCEPT THE SEA
     THAT DAY FRODO SPOKE TO ELROND AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE NEXT MORNING TO THEIR DELIGHT GANDALF SAID I THINK I SHALL COME TOO AT LEAST AS FAR AS BREE I WANT TO SEE BUTTERBUR
     IN THE EVENING THEY WENT TO SAY GOODBYE TO BILBO WELL IF YOU MUST GO YOU MUST HE SAID I AM SORRY I SHALL MISS YOU IT IS NICE JUST TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOUT THE PLACE BUT I AM GETTING VERY SLEEPY THEN HE GAVE FRODO HIS MITHRILCOAT AND STING FORGETTING THAT HE HAD ALREADY DONE SO AND HE GAVE HIM ALSO THREE BOOKS OF LORE THAT HE HAD MADE AT VARIOUS TIMES WRITTEN IN HIS SPIDERY HAND AND LABELLED ON THEIR RED BACKS TRANSLATIONS FROM THE ELVISH BY BB
     TO SAM HE GAVE A LITTLE BAG OF GOLD ALMOST THE LAST DROP OF THE SMAUG VINTAGE HE SAID MAY COME IN USEFUL IF YOU THINK OF GETTING MARRIED SAM SAM BLUSHED
     I HAVE NOTHING MUCH TO GIVE TO YOU YOUNG FELLOWS HE SAID TO MERRY AND PIPPIN EXCEPT GOOD ADVICE AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN THEM A FAIR SAMPLE OF THIS HE ADDED A LAST ITEM IN SHIREFASHION DONT LET YOUR HEADS GET TOO BIG FOR YOUR HATS BUT IF YOU DONT FINISH GROWING UP SOON YOU ARE GOING TO FIND HATS AND CLOTHES EXPENSIVE
     BUT IF YOU WANT TO BEAT THE OLD TOOK SAID PIPPIN I DONT SEE WHY WE SHOULDNT TRY AND BEAT THE BULLROARER
     BILBO LAUGHED AND HE PRODUCED OUT OF A POCKET TWO BEAUTIFUL PIPES WITH PEARL MOUTHPIECES AND BOUND WITH FINEWROUGHT SILVER THINK OF ME WHEN YOU SMOKE THEM HE SAID THE ELVES MADE THEM FOR ME BUT I DONT SMOKE NOW AND THEN SUDDENLY HE NODDED AND WENT TO SLEEP FOR A LITTLE AND WHEN HE WOKE UP AGAIN HE SAID NOW WHERE WERE WE YES OF COURSE GIVING PRESENTS WHICH REMINDS ME WHATS BECOME OF MY RING FRODO THAT YOU TOOK AWAY

     I EVIDENTLY CAME BACK BY MUCH TOO STRAIGHT A ROAD FROM MY TRIP I THINK GANDALF MIGHT HAVE SHOWN ME ROUND A BIT BUT THEN THE AUCTION WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER BEFORE I GOT BACK AND I SHOULD HAVE HAD EVEN MORE TROUBLE THAN I DID ANYWAY ITS TOO LATE NOW AND REALLY I THINK ITS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE TO SIT HERE AND HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE FIRES VERY COSY HERE AND THE FOODS VERY GOOD AND THERE ARE ELVES WHEN YOU WANT THEM WHAT MORE COULD ONE WANT
     
      
       THE ROAD GOES EVER ON AND ON

       NOW FAR AHEAD THE ROAD HAS GONE

       LET THEM A JOURNEY NEW BEGIN

       BUT I AT LAST WITH WEARY FEET

       WILL TURN TOWARDS THE LIGHTED INN

       MY EVENINGREST AND SLEEP TO MEET

      

     
     AND AS BILBO MURMURED THE LAST WORDS HIS HEAD DROPPED ON HIS CHEST AND HE SLEPT SOUNDLY
     THE EVENING DEEPENED IN THE ROOM AND THE FIRELIGHT BURNED BRIGHTER AND THEY LOOKED AT BILBO AS HE SLEPT AND SAW THAT HIS FACE WAS SMILING FOR SOME TIME THEY SAT IN SILENCE AND THEN SAM LOOKING ROUND AT THE ROOM AND THE SHADOWS FLICKERING ON THE WALLS SAID SOFTLY
     I DONT THINK MR FRODO THAT HES DONE MUCH WRITING WHILE WEVE BEEN AWAY HE WONT EVER WRITE OUR STORY NOW
     AT THAT BILBO OPENED AN EYE ALMOST AS IF HE HAD HEARD THEN HE ROUSED HIMSELF YOU SEE I AM GETTING SO SLEEPY HE SAID AND WHEN I HAVE TIME TO WRITE I ONLY REALLY LIKE WRITING POETRY I WONDER FRODO MY DEAR FELLOW IF YOU WOULD VERY MUCH MIND TIDYING THINGS UP A BIT BEFORE YOU GO COLLECT ALL MY NOTES AND PAPERS AND MY DIARY TOO AND TAKE THEM WITH YOU IF YOU WILL YOU SEE I HAVENT MUCH TIME FOR THE SELECTION AND THE ARRANGEMENT AND ALL THAT GET SAM TO HELP AND WHEN YOUVE KNOCKED THINGS INTO SHAPE COME BACK AND ILL RUN OVER IT I WONT BE TOO CRITICAL
     OF COURSE ILL DO IT SAID FRODO AND OF COURSE ILL COME BACK SOON IT WONT BE DANGEROUS ANY MORE THERE IS A REAL KING NOW AND HE WILL SOON PUT THE ROADS IN ORDER
     THANK YOU MY DEAR FELLOW SAID BILBO THAT REALLY IS A VERY GREAT RELIEF TO MY MIND AND WITH THAT HE FELL FAST ASLEEP AGAIN
     THE NEXT DAY GANDALF AND THE HOBBITS TOOK LEAVE OF BILBO IN HIS ROOM FOR IT WAS COLD OUT OF DOORS AND THEN THEY SAID FAREWELL TO ELROND AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD
     AS FRODO STOOD UPON THE THRESHOLD ELROND WISHED HIM A FAIR JOURNEY AND BLESSED HIM AND HE SAID
     I THINK FRODO THAT MAYBE YOU WILL NOT NEED TO COME BACK UNLESS YOU COME VERY SOON FOR ABOUT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN THE LEAVES ARE GOLD BEFORE THEY FALL LOOK FOR BILBO IN THE WOODS OF THE SHIRE I SHALL BE WITH HIM
     THESE WORDS NO ONE ELSE HEARD AND FRODO KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF

     NOT YET HE ANSWERED I AM GOING HOME NOW TO PUT MY NOTES IN ORDER HE PROMISED TO DEAL WITH THE AMAZING EVENTS AT BREE AND SO GIVE A BIT OF INTEREST TO A BOOK THAT APPEARED LIKELY TO TREAT MOSTLY OF THE REMOTE AND LESS IMPORTANT AFFAIRS AWAY SOUTH
     THEN ONE OF THE YOUNGER FOLK CALLED FOR A SONG BUT AT THAT A HUSH FELL AND HE WAS FROWNED DOWN AND THE CALL WAS NOT REPEATED EVIDENTLY THERE WAS NO WISH FOR ANY UNCANNY EVENTS IN THE COMMON ROOM AGAIN

     THEY HALTED AND FRODO LOOKED SOUTH WISTFULLY I SHOULD DEARLY LIKE TO SEE THE OLD FELLOW AGAIN HE SAID I WONDER HOW HE IS GETTING ON
     AS WELL AS EVER YOU MAY BE SURE SAID GANDALF QUITE UNTROUBLED AND I SHOULD GUESS NOT MUCH INTERESTED IN ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE OR SEEN UNLESS PERHAPS IN OUR VISITS TO THE ENTS THERE MAY BE A TIME LATER FOR YOU TO GO AND SEE HIM BUT IF I WERE YOU I SHOULD PRESS ON NOW FOR HOME OR YOU WILL NOT COME TO THE BRANDYWINE BRIDGE BEFORE THE GATES ARE LOCKED

     SARUMAN LOOKED ROUND AT THEIR HOSTILE FACES AND SMILED KILL HIM HE MOCKED KILL HIM IF YOU THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH OF YOU MY BRAVE HOBBITS HE DREW HIMSELF UP AND STARED AT THEM DARKLY WITH HIS BLACK EYES BUT DO NOT THINK THAT WHEN I LOST ALL MY GOODS I LOST ALL MY POWER WHOEVER STRIKES ME SHALL BE ACCURSED AND IF MY BLOOD STAINS THE SHIRE IT SHALL WITHER AND NEVER AGAIN BE HEALED
     THE HOBBITS RECOILED BUT FRODO SAID DO NOT BELIEVE HIM HE HAS LOST ALL POWER SAVE HIS VOICE THAT CAN STILL DAUNT YOU AND DECEIVE YOU IF YOU LET IT BUT I WILL NOT HAVE HIM SLAIN IT IS USELESS TO MEET REVENGE WITH REVENGE IT WILL HEAL NOTHING GO SARUMAN BY THE SPEEDIEST WAY
     WORM WORM SARUMAN CALLED AND OUT OF A NEARBY HUT CAME WORMTONGUE CRAWLING ALMOST LIKE A DOG TO THE ROAD AGAIN WORM SAID SARUMAN THESE FINE FELLOWS AND LORDLINGS ARE TURNING US ADRIFT AGAIN COME ALONG
     SARUMAN TURNED TO GO AND WORMTONGUE SHUFFLED AFTER HIM BUT EVEN AS SARUMAN PASSED CLOSE TO FRODO A KNIFE FLASHED IN HIS HAND AND HE STABBED SWIFTLY THE BLADE TURNED ON THE HIDDEN MAILCOAT AND SNAPPED A DOZEN HOBBITS LED BY SAM LEAPED FORWARD WITH A CRY AND FLUNG THE VILLAIN TO THE GROUND SAM DREW HIS SWORD
     NO SAM SAID FRODO DO NOT KILL HIM EVEN NOW FOR HE HAS NOT HURT ME AND IN ANY CASE I DO NOT WISH HIM TO BE SLAIN IN THIS EVIL MOOD HE WAS GREAT ONCE OF A NOBLE KIND THAT WE SHOULD NOT DARE TO RAISE OUR HANDS AGAINST HE IS FALLEN AND HIS CURE IS BEYOND US BUT I WOULD STILL SPARE HIM IN THE HOPE THAT HE MAY FIND IT
     SARUMAN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND STARED AT FRODO THERE WAS A STRANGE LOOK IN HIS EYES OF MINGLED WONDER AND RESPECT AND HATRED YOU HAVE GROWN HALFLING HE SAID YES YOU HAVE GROWN VERY MUCH YOU ARE WISE AND CRUEL YOU HAVE ROBBED MY REVENGE OF SWEETNESS AND NOW I MUST GO HENCE IN BITTERNESS IN DEBT TO YOUR MERCY I HATE IT AND YOU WELL I GO AND I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO MORE BUT DO NOT EXPECT ME TO WISH YOU HEALTH AND LONG LIFE YOU WILL HAVE NEITHER BUT THAT IS NOT MY DOING I MERELY FORETELL
     HE WALKED AWAY AND THE HOBBITS MADE A LANE FOR HIM TO PASS BUT THEIR KNUCKLES WHITENED AS THEY GRIPPED ON THEIR WEAPONS WORMTONGUE HESITATED AND THEN FOLLOWED HIS MASTER
     WORMTONGUE CALLED FRODO YOU NEED NOT FOLLOW HIM I KNOW OF NO EVIL YOU HAVE DONE TO ME YOU CAN HAVE REST AND FOOD HERE FOR A WHILE UNTIL YOU ARE STRONGER AND CAN GO YOUR OWN WAYS
     WORMTONGUE HALTED AND LOOKED BACK AT HIM HALF PREPARED TO STAY SARUMAN TURNED NO EVIL HE CACKLED OH NO EVEN WHEN HE SNEAKS OUT AT NIGHT IT IS ONLY TO LOOK AT THE STARS BUT DID I HEAR SOMEONE ASK WHERE POOR LOTHO IS HIDING YOU KNOW DONT YOU WORM WILL YOU TELL THEM
     WORMTONGUE COWERED DOWN AND WHIMPERED NO NO
     THEN I WILL SAID SARUMAN WORM KILLED YOUR CHIEF POOR LITTLE FELLOW YOUR NICE LITTLE BOSS DIDNT YOU WORM STABBED HIM IN HIS SLEEP I BELIEVE BURIED HIM I HOPE THOUGH WORM HAS BEEN VERY HUNGRY LATELY NO WORM IS NOT REALLY NICE YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE HIM TO ME
     A LOOK OF WILD HATRED CAME INTO WORMTONGUES RED EYES YOU TOLD ME TO YOU MADE ME DO IT HE HISSED
     SARUMAN LAUGHED YOU DO WHAT SHARKEY SAYS ALWAYS DONT YOU WORM WELL NOW HE SAYS FOLLOW HE KICKED WORMTONGUE IN THE FACE AS HE GROVELLED AND TURNED AND MADE OFF BUT AT THAT SOMETHING SNAPPED SUDDENLY WORMTONGUE ROSE UP DRAWING A HIDDEN KNIFE AND THEN WITH A SNARL LIKE A DOG HE SPRANG ON SARUMANS BACK JERKED HIS HEAD BACK CUT HIS THROAT AND WITH A YELL RAN OFF DOWN THE LANE BEFORE FRODO COULD RECOVER OR SPEAK A WORD THREE HOBBITBOWS TWANGED AND WORMTONGUE FELL DEAD
     TO THE DISMAY OF THOSE THAT STOOD BY ABOUT THE BODY OF SARUMAN A GREY MIST GATHERED AND RISING SLOWLY TO A GREAT HEIGHT LIKE SMOKE FROM A FIRE AS A PALE SHROUDED FIGURE IT LOOMED OVER THE HILL FOR A MOMENT IT WAVERED LOOKING TO THE WEST BUT OUT OF THE WEST CAME A COLD WIND AND IT BENT AWAY AND WITH A SIGH DISSOLVED INTO NOTHING
     FRODO LOOKED DOWN AT THE BODY WITH PITY AND HORROR FOR AS HE LOOKED IT SEEMED THAT LONG YEARS OF DEATH WERE SUDDENLY REVEALED IN IT AND IT SHRANK AND THE SHRIVELLED FACE BECAME RAGS OF SKIN UPON A HIDEOUS SKULL LIFTING UP THE SKIRT OF THE DIRTY CLOAK THAT SPRAWLED BESIDE IT HE COVERED IT OVER AND TURNED AWAY
     AND THATS THE END OF THAT SAID SAM A NASTY END AND I WISH I NEEDNT HAVE SEEN IT BUT ITS A GOOD RIDDANCE
     AND THE VERY LAST END OF THE WAR I HOPE SAID MERRY
     I HOPE SO SAID FRODO AND SIGHED THE VERY LAST STROKE BUT TO THINK THAT IT SHOULD FALL HERE AT THE VERY DOOR OF BAG END AMONG ALL MY HOPES AND FEARS AT LEAST I NEVER EXPECTED THAT
     I SHANT CALL IT THE END TILL WEVE CLEARED UP THE MESS SAID SAM GLOOMILY AND THATLL TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND WORK
    

    

     

      CHAPTER 9
      THE GREY HAVENS
     

     THE CLEARING UP CERTAINLY NEEDED A LOT OF WORK BUT IT TOOK LESS TIME THAN SAM HAD FEARED THE DAY AFTER THE BATTLE FRODO RODE TO MICHEL DELVING AND RELEASED THE PRISONERS FROM THE LOCKHOLES ONE OF THE FIRST THAT THEY FOUND WAS POOR FREDEGAR BOLGER FATTY NO LONGER HE HAD BEEN TAKEN WHEN THE RUFFIANS SMOKED OUT A BAND OF REBELS THAT HE LED FROM THEIR HIDINGS UP IN THE BROCKENBORES BY THE HILLS OF SCARY
     YOU WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO COME WITH US AFTER ALL POOR OLD FREDEGAR SAID PIPPIN AS THEY CARRIED HIM OUT TOO WEAK TO WALK
     HE OPENED AN EYE AND TRIED GALLANTLY TO SMILE WHOS THIS YOUNG GIANT WITH THE LOUD VOICE HE WHISPERED NOT LITTLE PIPPIN WHATS YOUR SIZE IN HATS NOW
     THEN THERE WAS LOBELIA POOR THING SHE LOOKED VERY OLD AND THIN WHEN THEY RESCUED HER FROM A DARK AND NARROW CELL SHE INSISTED ON HOBBLING OUT ON HER OWN FEET AND SHE HAD SUCH A WELCOME AND THERE WAS SUCH CLAPPING AND CHEERING WHEN SHE APPEARED LEANING ON FRODOS ARM BUT STILL CLUTCHING HER UMBRELLA THAT SHE WAS QUITE TOUCHED AND DROVE AWAY IN TEARS SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE BEEN POPULAR BEFORE BUT SHE WAS CRUSHED BY THE NEWS OF LOTHOS MURDER AND SHE WOULD NOT RETURN TO BAG END SHE GAVE IT BACK TO FRODO AND WENT TO HER OWN PEOPLE THE BRACEGIRDLES OF HARDBOTTLE
     WHEN THE POOR CREATURE DIED NEXT SPRINGSHE WAS AFTER ALL MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS OLD  FRODO WAS SURPRISED AND MUCH MOVED SHE HAD LEFT ALL THAT REMAINED OF HER MONEY AND OF LOTHOS FOR HIM TO USE IN HELPING HOBBITS MADE HOMELESS BY THE TROUBLES SO THAT FEUD WAS ENDED
     OLD WILL WHITFOOT HAD BEEN IN THE LOCKHOLES LONGER THAN ANY AND THOUGH HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN TREATED LESS HARSHLY THAN SOME HE NEEDED A LOT OF FEEDING UP BEFORE HE COULD LOOK THE PART OF MAYOR SO FRODO AGREED TO ACT AS HIS DEPUTY UNTIL MR WHITFOOT WAS IN SHAPE AGAIN THE ONLY THING THAT HE DID AS DEPUTY MAYOR WAS TO REDUCE THE SHIRRIFFS TO THEIR PROPER FUNCTIONS AND NUMBERS THE TASK OF HUNTING OUT THE LAST REMNANT OF THE RUFFIANS WAS LEFT TO MERRY AND PIPPIN AND IT WAS SOON DONE THE SOUTHERN GANGS AFTER HEARING THE NEWS OF THE BATTLE OF BYWATER FLED OUT OF THE LAND AND OFFERED LITTLE RESISTANCE TO THE THAIN BEFORE THE YEARS END THE FEW SURVIVORS WERE ROUNDED UP IN THE WOODS AND THOSE THAT SURRENDERED WERE SHOWN TO THE BORDERS
     MEANWHILE THE LABOUR OF REPAIR WENT ON APACE AND SAM WAS KEPT VERY BUSY HOBBITS CAN WORK LIKE BEES WHEN THE MOOD AND THE NEED COMES ON THEM NOW THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF WILLING HANDS OF ALL AGES FROM THE SMALL BUT NIMBLE ONES OF THE HOBBIT LADS AND LASSES TO THE WELLWORN AND HORNY ONES OF THE GAFFERS AND GAMMERS BEFORE YULE NOT A BRICK WAS LEFT STANDING OF THE NEW SHIRRIFFHOUSES OR OF ANYTHING THAT HAD BEEN BUILT BY SHARKEYS MEN BUT THE BRICKS WERE USED TO REPAIR MANY AN OLD HOLE TO MAKE IT SNUGGER AND DRIER GREAT STORES OF GOODS AND FOOD AND BEER WERE FOUND THAT HAD BEEN HIDDEN AWAY BY THE RUFFIANS IN SHEDS AND BARNS AND DESERTED HOLES AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TUNNELS AT MICHEL DELVING AND IN THE OLD QUARRIES AT SCARY SO THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL BETTER CHEER THAT YULE THAN ANYONE HAD HOPED FOR
     ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS DONE IN HOBBITON BEFORE EVEN THE REMOVAL OF THE NEW MILL WAS THE CLEARING OF THE HILL AND BAG END AND THE RESTORATION OF BAGSHOT ROW THE FRONT OF THE NEW SANDPIT WAS ALL LEVELLED AND MADE INTO A LARGE SHELTERED GARDEN AND NEW HOLES WERE DUG IN THE SOUTHWARD FACE BACK INTO THE HILL AND THEY WERE LINED WITH BRICK THE GAFFER WAS RESTORED TO NUMBER THREE AND HE SAID OFTEN AND DID NOT CARE WHO HEARD IT
     ITS AN ILL WIND AS BLOWS NOBODY NO GOOD AS I ALWAYS SAY AND ALLS WELL AS ENDS BETTER
     THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION OF THE NAME THAT THE NEW ROW SHOULD BE GIVEN BATTLE GARDENS WAS THOUGHT OF OR BETTER SMIALS BUT AFTER A WHILE IN SENSIBLE HOBBITFASHION IT WAS JUST CALLED NEW ROW IT WAS A PURELY BYWATER JOKE TO REFER TO IT AS SHARKEYS END
     THE TREES WERE THE WORST LOSS AND DAMAGE FOR AT SHARKEYS BIDDING THEY HAD BEEN CUT DOWN RECKLESSLY FAR AND WIDE OVER THE SHIRE AND SAM GRIEVED OVER THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR ONE THING THIS HURT WOULD TAKE LONG TO HEAL AND ONLY HIS GREATGRANDCHILDREN HE THOUGHT WOULD SEE THE SHIRE AS IT OUGHT TO BE
     THEN SUDDENLY ONE DAY FOR HE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY FOR WEEKS TO GIVE A THOUGHT TO HIS ADVENTURES HE REMEMBERED THE GIFT OF GALADRIEL HE BROUGHT THE BOX OUT AND SHOWED IT TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS FOR SO THEY WERE NOW CALLED BY EVERYONE AND ASKED THEIR ADVICE
     I WONDERED WHEN YOU WOULD THINK OF IT SAID FRODO OPEN IT
     INSIDE IT WAS FILLED WITH A GREY DUST SOFT AND FINE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH WAS A SEED LIKE A SMALL NUT WITH A SILVER SHALE WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS SAID SAM
     THROW IT IN THE AIR ON A BREEZY DAY AND LET IT DO ITS WORK SAID PIPPIN
     ON WHAT SAID SAM
     CHOOSE ONE SPOT AS A NURSERY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PLANTS THERE SAID MERRY
     BUT IM SURE THE LADY WOULD NOT LIKE ME TO KEEP IT ALL FOR MY OWN GARDEN NOW SO MANY FOLK HAVE SUFFERED SAID SAM
     USE ALL THE WITS AND KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE OF YOUR OWN SAM SAID FRODO AND THEN USE THE GIFT TO HELP YOUR WORK AND BETTER IT AND USE IT SPARINGLY THERE IS NOT MUCH HERE AND I EXPECT EVERY GRAIN HAS A VALUE
     SO SAM PLANTED SAPLINGS IN ALL THE PLACES WHERE SPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL OR BELOVED TREES HAD BEEN DESTROYED AND HE PUT A GRAIN OF THE PRECIOUS DUST IN THE SOIL AT THE ROOT OF EACH HE WENT UP AND DOWN THE SHIRE IN THIS LABOUR BUT IF HE PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO HOBBITON AND BYWATER NO ONE BLAMED HIM AND AT THE END HE FOUND THAT HE STILL HAD A LITTLE OF THE DUST LEFT SO HE WENT TO THE THREEFARTHING STONE WHICH IS AS NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE SHIRE AS NO MATTER AND CAST IT IN THE AIR WITH HIS BLESSING THE LITTLE SILVER NUT HE PLANTED IN THE PARTY FIELD WHERE THE TREE HAD ONCE BEEN AND HE WONDERED WHAT WOULD COME OF IT ALL THROUGH THE WINTER HE REMAINED AS PATIENT AS HE COULD AND TRIED TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM GOING ROUND CONSTANTLY TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS HAPPENING
     SPRING SURPASSED HIS WILDEST HOPES HIS TREES BEGAN TO SPROUT AND GROW AS IF TIME WAS IN A HURRY AND WISHED TO MAKE ONE YEAR DO FOR TWENTY IN THE PARTY FIELD A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG SAPLING LEAPED UP IT HAD SILVER BARK AND LONG LEAVES AND BURST INTO GOLDEN FLOWERS IN APRIL IT WAS INDEED A MALLORN AND IT WAS THE WONDER OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN AFTER YEARS AS IT GREW IN GRACE AND BEAUTY IT WAS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE AND PEOPLE WOULD COME LONG JOURNEYS TO SEE IT THE ONLY MALLORN WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS AND EAST OF THE SEA AND ONE OF THE FINEST IN THE WORLD
     ALTOGETHER 1420 IN THE SHIRE WAS A MARVELLOUS YEAR NOT ONLY WAS THERE WONDERFUL SUNSHINE AND DELICIOUS RAIN IN DUE TIMES AND PERFECT MEASURE BUT THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MORE AN AIR OF RICHNESS AND GROWTH AND A GLEAM OF A BEAUTY BEYOND THAT OF MORTAL SUMMERS THAT FLICKER AND PASS UPON THIS MIDDLEEARTH ALL THE CHILDREN BORN OR BEGOTTEN IN THAT YEAR AND THERE WERE MANY WERE FAIR TO SEE AND STRONG AND MOST OF THEM HAD A RICH GOLDEN HAIR THAT HAD BEFORE BEEN RARE AMONG HOBBITS THE FRUIT WAS SO PLENTIFUL THAT YOUNG HOBBITS VERY NEARLY BATHED IN STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM AND LATER THEY SAT ON THE LAWNS UNDER THE PLUMTREES AND ATE UNTIL THEY HAD MADE PILES OF STONES LIKE SMALL PYRAMIDS OR THE HEAPED SKULLS OF A CONQUEROR AND THEN THEY MOVED ON AND NO ONE WAS ILL AND EVERYONE WAS PLEASED EXCEPT THOSE WHO HAD TO MOW THE GRASS
     IN THE SOUTHFARTHING THE VINES WERE LADEN AND THE YIELD OF LEAF WAS ASTONISHING AND EVERYWHERE THERE WAS SO MUCH CORN THAT AT HARVEST EVERY BARN WAS STUFFED THE NORTHFARTHING BARLEY WAS SO FINE THAT THE BEER OF 1420 MALT WAS LONG REMEMBERED AND BECAME A BYWORD INDEED A GENERATION LATER ONE MIGHT HEAR AN OLD GAFFER IN AN INN AFTER A GOOD PINT OF WELLEARNED ALE PUT DOWN HIS MUG WITH A SIGH AH THAT WAS PROPER FOURTEENTWENTY THAT WAS
     SAM STAYED AT FIRST AT THE COTTONS WITH FRODO BUT WHEN THE NEW ROW WAS READY HE WENT WITH THE GAFFER IN ADDITION TO ALL HIS OTHER LABOURS HE WAS BUSY DIRECTING THE CLEANING UP AND RESTORING OF BAG END BUT HE WAS OFTEN AWAY IN THE SHIRE ON HIS FORESTRY WORK SO HE WAS NOT AT HOME IN EARLY MARCH AND DID NOT KNOW THAT FRODO HAD BEEN ILL ON THE THIRTEENTH OF THAT MONTH FARMER COTTON FOUND FRODO LYING ON HIS BED HE WAS CLUTCHING A WHITE GEM THAT HUNG ON A CHAIN ABOUT HIS NECK AND HE SEEMED HALF IN A DREAM
     IT IS GONE FOR EVER HE SAID AND NOW ALL IS DARK AND EMPTY
     BUT THE FIT PASSED AND WHEN SAM GOT BACK ON THE TWENTYFIFTH FRODO HAD RECOVERED AND HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT HIMSELF IN THE MEANWHILE BAG END HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER AND MERRY AND PIPPIN CAME OVER FROM CRICKHOLLOW BRINGING BACK ALL THE OLD FURNITURE AND GEAR SO THAT THE OLD HOLE SOON LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IT ALWAYS HAD DONE
     WHEN ALL WAS AT LAST READY FRODO SAID WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO MOVE IN AND JOIN ME SAM
     SAM LOOKED A BIT AWKWARD
     THERE IS NO NEED TO COME YET IF YOU DONT WANT TO SAID FRODO BUT YOU KNOW THE GAFFER IS CLOSE AT HAND AND HE WILL BE VERY WELL LOOKED AFTER BY WIDOW RUMBLE
     IT S NOT THAT MR FRODO SAID SAM AND HE WENT VERY RED
     WELL WHAT IS IT
     ITS ROSIE ROSE COTTON SAID SAM IT SEEMS SHE DIDNT LIKE MY GOING ABROAD AT ALL POOR LASS BUT AS I HADNT SPOKEN SHE COULDNT SAY SO AND I DIDNT SPEAK BECAUSE I HAD A JOB TO DO FIRST BUT NOW I HAVE SPOKEN AND SHE SAYS WELL YOUVE WASTED A YEAR SO WHY WAIT LONGER WASTED I SAYS I WOULDNT CALL IT THAT STILL I SEE WHAT SHE MEANS I FEEL TORN IN TWO AS YOU MIGHT SAY
     I SEE SAID FRODO YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED AND YET YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH ME IN BAG END TOO BUT MY DEAR SAM HOW EASY GET MARRIED AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND THEN MOVE IN WITH ROSIE THERES ROOM ENOUGH IN BAG END FOR AS BIG A FAMILY AS YOU COULD WISH FOR
     AND SO IT WAS SETTLED SAM GAMGEE MARRIED ROSE COTTON IN THE SPRING OF 1420 WHICH WAS ALSO FAMOUS FOR ITS WEDDINGS AND THEY CAME AND LIVED AT BAG END AND IF SAM THOUGHT HIMSELF LUCKY FRODO KNEW THAT HE WAS MORE LUCKY HIMSELF FOR THERE WAS NOT A HOBBIT IN THE SHIRE THAT WAS LOOKED AFTER WITH SUCH CARE WHEN THE LABOURS OF REPAIR HAD ALL BEEN PLANNED AND SET GOING HE TOOK TO A QUIET LIFE WRITING A GREAT DEAL AND GOING THROUGH ALL HIS NOTES HE RESIGNED THE OFFICE OF DEPUTY MAYOR AT THE FREE FAIR THAT MIDSUMMER AND DEAR OLD WILL WHITFOOT HAD ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS OF PRESIDING AT BANQUETS
     MERRY AND PIPPIN LIVED TOGETHER FOR SOME TIME AT CRICKHOLLOW AND THERE WAS MUCH COMING AND GOING BETWEEN BUCKLAND AND BAG END THE TWO YOUNG TRAVELLERS CUT A GREAT DASH IN THE SHIRE WITH THEIR SONGS AND THEIR TALES AND THEIR FINERY AND THEIR WONDERFUL PARTIES LORDLY FOLK CALLED THEM MEANING NOTHING BUT GOOD FOR IT WARMED ALL HEARTS TO SEE THEM GO RIDING BY WITH THEIR MAILSHIRTS SO BRIGHT AND THEIR SHIELDS SO SPLENDID LAUGHING AND SINGING SONGS OF FAR AWAY AND IF THEY WERE NOW LARGE AND MAGNIFICENT THEY WERE UNCHANGED OTHERWISE UNLESS THEY WERE INDEED MORE FAIRSPOKEN AND MORE JOVIAL AND FULL OF MERRIMENT THAN EVER BEFORE
     FRODO AND SAM HOWEVER WENT BACK TO ORDINARY ATTIRE EXCEPT THAT WHEN THERE WAS NEED THEY BOTH WORE LONG GREY CLOAKS FINELY WOVEN AND CLASPED AT THE THROAT WITH BEAUTIFUL BROOCHES AND MR FRODO WORE ALWAYS A WHITE JEWEL ON A CHAIN THAT HE OFTEN WOULD FINGER
     ALL THINGS NOW WENT WELL WITH HOPE ALWAYS OF BECOMING STILL BETTER AND SAM WAS AS BUSY AND AS FULL OF DELIGHT AS EVEN A HOBBIT COULD WISH NOTHING FOR HIM MARRED THAT WHOLE YEAR EXCEPT FOR SOME VAGUE ANXIETY ABOUT HIS MASTER FRODO DROPPED QUIETLY OUT OF ALL THE DOINGS OF THE SHIRE AND SAM WAS PAINED TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HONOUR HE HAD IN HIS OWN COUNTRY FEW PEOPLE KNEW OR WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT HIS DEEDS AND ADVENTURES THEIR ADMIRATION AND RESPECT WERE GIVEN MOSTLY TO MR MERIADOC AND MR PEREGRIN AND IF SAM HAD KNOWN IT TO HIMSELF ALSO IN THE AUTUMN THERE APPEARED A SHADOW OF OLD TROUBLES
     ONE EVENING SAM CAME INTO THE STUDY AND FOUND HIS MASTER LOOKING VERY STRANGE HE WAS VERY PALE AND HIS EYES SEEMED TO SEE THINGS FAR AWAY
     WHATS THE MATTER MR FRODO SAID SAM
     I AM WOUNDED HE ANSWERED WOUNDED IT WILL NEVER REALLY HEAL
     BUT THEN HE GOT UP AND THE TURN SEEMED TO PASS AND HE WAS QUITE HIMSELF THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTERWARDS THAT SAM RECALLED THAT THE DATE WAS OCTOBER THE SIXTH TWO YEARS BEFORE ON THAT DAY IT WAS DARK IN THE DELL UNDER WEATHERTOP
     TIME WENT ON AND 1421 CAME IN FRODO WAS ILL AGAIN IN MARCH BUT WITH A GREAT EFFORT HE CONCEALED IT FOR SAM HAD OTHER THINGS TO THINK ABOUT THE FIRST OF SAM AND ROSIES CHILDREN WAS BORN ON THE TWENTYFIFTH OF MARCH A DATE THAT SAM NOTED
     WELL MR FRODO HE SAID IM IN A BIT OF A FIX ROSE AND ME HAD SETTLED TO CALL HIM FRODO WITH YOUR LEAVE BUT ITS NOT HIM ITS HER THOUGH AS PRETTY A MAIDCHILD AS ANY ONE COULD HOPE FOR TAKING AFTER ROSE MORE THAN ME LUCKILY SO WE DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO
     WELL SAM SAID FRODO WHATS WRONG WITH THE OLD CUSTOMS CHOOSE A FLOWER NAME LIKE ROSE HALF THE MAIDCHILDREN IN THE SHIRE ARE CALLED BY SUCH NAMES AND WHAT COULD BE BETTER
     I SUPPOSE YOURE RIGHT MR FRODO SAID SAM IVE HEARD SOME BEAUTIFUL NAMES ON MY TRAVELS BUT I SUPPOSE THEYRE A BIT TOO GRAND FOR DAILY WEAR AND TEAR AS YOU MIGHT SAY THE GAFFER HE SAYS MAKE IT SHORT AND THEN YOU WONT HAVE TO CUT IT SHORT BEFORE YOU CAN USE IT BUT IF ITS TO BE A FLOWERNAME THEN I DONT TROUBLE ABOUT THE LENGTH IT MUST BE A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER BECAUSE YOU SEE I THINK SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND IS GOING TO BE BEAUTIFULLER STILL
     FRODO THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT WELL SAM WHAT ABOUT ELANOR THE SUNSTAR YOU REMEMBER THE LITTLE GOLDEN FLOWER IN THE GRASS OF LOTHL
     YOURE RIGHT AGAIN MR FRODO SAID SAM DELIGHTED THATS WHAT I WANTED
     LITTLE ELANOR WAS NEARLY SIX MONTHS OLD AND 1421 HAD PASSED TO ITS AUTUMN WHEN FRODO CALLED SAM INTO THE STUDY
     IT WILL BE BILBOS BIRTHDAY ON THURSDAY SAM HE SAID AND HE WILL PASS THE OLD TOOK HE WILL BE A HUNDRED AND THIRTYONE
     SO HE WILL SAID SAM HES A MARVEL
     WELL SAM SAID FRODO I WANT YOU TO SEE ROSE AND FIND OUT IF SHE CAN SPARE YOU SO THAT YOU AND I CAN GO OFF TOGETHER YOU CANT GO FAR OR FOR A LONG TIME NOW OF COURSE HE SAID A LITTLE WISTFULLY
     WELL NOT VERY WELL MR FRODO
     OF COURSE NOT BUT NEVER MIND YOU CAN SEE ME ON MY WAY TELL ROSE THAT YOU WONT BE AWAY VERY LONG NOT MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT AND YOULL COME BACK QUITE SAFE
     I WISH I COULD GO ALL THE WAY WITH YOU TO RIVENDELL MR FRODO AND SEE MR BILBO SAID SAM AND YET THE ONLY PLACE I REALLY WANT TO BE IN IS HERE I AM THAT TORN IN TWO
     POOR SAM IT WILL FEEL LIKE THAT I AM AFRAID SAID FRODO BUT YOU WILL BE HEALED YOU WERE MEANT TO BE SOLID AND WHOLE AND YOU WILL BE
     IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO FRODO WENT THROUGH HIS PAPERS AND HIS WRITINGS WITH SAM AND HE HANDED OVER HIS KEYS THERE WAS A BIG BOOK WITH PLAIN RED LEATHER COVERS ITS TALL PAGES WERE NOW ALMOST FILLED AT THE BEGINNING THERE WERE MANY LEAVES COVERED WITH BILBOS THIN WANDERING HAND BUT MOST OF IT WAS WRITTEN IN FRODOS FIRM FLOWING SCRIPT IT WAS DIVIDED INTO CHAPTERS BUT CHAPTER 80 WAS UNFINISHED AND AFTER THAT WERE SOME BLANK LEAVES THE TITLE PAGE HAD MANY TITLES ON IT CROSSED OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER SO
     MY DIARY MY UNEXPECTED JOURNEY THERE AND BACK AGAIN AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
     ADVENTURES OF FIVE HOBBITS THE TALE OF THE GREAT RING COMPILED BY BILBO BAGGINS FROM HIS OWN OBSERVATIONS AND THE ACCOUNTS OF HIS FRIENDS WHAT WE DID IN THE WAR OF THE RING
     HERE BILBOS HAND ENDED AND FRODO HAD WRITTEN
     THE DOWNFALL OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND THE RETURN OF THE KING
     AS SEEN BY THE LITTLE PEOPLE BEING THE MEMOIRS OF BILBO AND FRODO OF THE SHIRE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND THE LEARNING OF THE WISE
     TOGETHER WITH EXTRACTS FROM BOOKS OF LORE TRANSLATED BY BILBO IN RIVENDELL
     WHY YOU HAVE NEARLY FINISHED IT MR FRODO SAM EXCLAIMED WELL YOU HAVE KEPT AT IT I MUST SAY
     I HAVE QUITE FINISHED SAM SAID FRODO THE LAST PAGES ARE FOR YOU
     ON SEPTEMBER THE TWENTYFIRST THEY SET OUT TOGETHER FRODO ON THE PONY THAT HAD BORNE HIM ALL THE WAY FROM MINAS TIRITH AND WAS NOW CALLED STRIDER AND SAM ON HIS BELOVED BILL IT WAS A FAIR GOLDEN MORNING AND SAM DID NOT ASK WHERE THEY WERE GOING HE THOUGHT HE COULD GUESS
     THEY TOOK THE STOCK ROAD OVER THE HILLS AND WENT TOWARDS THE WOODY END AND THEY LET THEIR PONIES WALK AT THEIR LEISURE THEY CAMPED IN THE GREEN HILLS AND ON SEPTEMBER THE TWENTYSECOND THEY RODE GENTLY DOWN INTO THE BEGINNING OF THE TREES AS AFTERNOON WAS WEARING AWAY
     IF THAT ISNT THE VERY TREE YOU HID BEHIND WHEN THE BLACK RIDER FIRST SHOWED UP MR FRODO SAID SAM POINTING TO THE LEFT IT SEEMS LIKE A DREAM NOW
     IT WAS EVENING AND THE STARS WERE GLIMMERING IN THE EASTERN SKY AS THEY PASSED THE RUINED OAK AND TURNED AND WENT ON DOWN THE HILL BETWEEN THE HAZELTHICKETS SAM WAS SILENT DEEP IN HIS MEMORIES PRESENTLY HE BECAME AWARE THAT FRODO WAS SINGING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF SINGING THE OLD WALKINGSONG BUT THE WORDS WERE NOT QUITE THE SAME
     
      
       STILL ROUND THE CORNER THERE MAY WAIT

       A NEW ROAD OR A SECRET GATE

       AND THOUGH I OFT HAVE PASSED THEM BY

       A DAY WILL COME AT LAST WHEN I

       SHALL TAKE THE HIDDEN PATHS THAT RUN

       WEST OF THE MOON EAST OF THE SUN

      

     
     AND AS IF IN ANSWER FROM DOWN BELOW COMING UP THE ROAD OUT OF THE VALLEY VOICES SANG
     
      
       A ELBERETH GILTHONIEL

       SILIVREN PENNA M

       O MENEL AGLAR ELENATH

       GILTHONIEL A ELBERETH

       WE STILL REMEMBER WE WHO DWELL

       IN THIS FAR LAND BENEATH THE TREES

       THE STARLIGHT ON THE WESTERN SEAS

      

     
     FRODO AND SAM HALTED AND SAT SILENT IN THE SOFT SHADOWS UNTIL THEY SAW A SHIMMER AS THE TRAVELLERS CAME TOWARDS THEM
     THERE WAS GILDOR AND MANY FAIR ELVEN FOLK AND THERE TO SAMS WONDER RODE ELROND AND GALADRIEL ELROND WORE A MANTLE OF GREY AND HAD A STAR UPON HIS FOREHEAD AND A SILVER HARP WAS IN HIS HAND AND UPON HIS FINGER WAS A RING OF GOLD WITH A GREAT BLUE STONE VILYA MIGHTIEST OF THE THREE BUT GALADRIEL SAT UPON A WHITE PALFREY AND WAS ROBED ALL IN GLIMMERING WHITE LIKE CLOUDS ABOUT THE MOON FOR SHE HERSELF SEEMED TO SHINE WITH A SOFT LIGHT ON HER FINGER WAS NENYA THE RING WROUGHT OF MITHRIL THAT BORE A SINGLE WHITE STONE FLICKERING LIKE A FROSTY STAR RIDING SLOWLY BEHIND ON A SMALL GREY PONY AND SEEMING TO NOD IN HIS SLEEP WAS BILBO HIMSELF
     ELROND GREETED THEM GRAVELY AND GRACIOUSLY AND GALADRIEL SMILED UPON THEM WELL MASTER SAMWISE SHE SAID I HEAR AND SEE THAT YOU HAVE USED MY GIFT WELL THE SHIRE SHALL NOW BE MORE THAN EVER BLESSED AND BELOVED SAM BOWED BUT FOUND NOTHING TO SAY HE HAD FORGOTTEN HOW BEAUTIFUL THE LADY WAS
     THEN BILBO WOKE UP AND OPENED HIS EYES HULLO FRODO HE SAID WELL I HAVE PASSED THE OLD TOOK TODAY SO THATS SETTLED AND NOW I THINK I AM QUITE READY TO GO ON ANOTHER JOURNEY ARE YOU COMING
     YES I AM COMING SAID FRODO THE RINGBEARERS SHOULD GO TOGETHER
     WHERE ARE YOU GOING MASTER CRIED SAM THOUGH AT LAST HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS HAPPENING
     TO THE HAVENS SAM SAID FRODO
     AND I CANT COME
     NO SAM NOT YET ANYWAY NOT FURTHER THAN THE HAVENS THOUGH YOU TOO WERE A RINGBEARER IF ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE YOUR TIME MAY COME DO NOT BE TOO SAD SAM YOU CANNOT BE ALWAYS TORN IN TWO YOU WILL HAVE TO BE ONE AND WHOLE FOR MANY YEARS YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO ENJOY AND TO BE AND TO DO
     BUT SAID SAM AND TEARS STARTED IN HIS EYES I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO ENJOY THE SHIRE TOO FOR YEARS AND YEARS AFTER ALL YOU HAVE DONE
     SO I THOUGHT TOO ONCE BUT I HAVE BEEN TOO DEEPLY HURT SAM I TRIED TO SAVE THE SHIRE AND IT HAS BEEN SAVED BUT NOT FOR ME IT MUST OFTEN BE SO SAM WHEN THINGS ARE IN DANGER SOME ONE HAS TO GIVE THEM UP LOSE THEM SO THAT OTHERS MAY KEEP THEM BUT YOU ARE MY HEIR ALL THAT I HAD AND MIGHT HAVE HAD I LEAVE TO YOU AND ALSO YOU HAVE ROSE AND ELANOR AND FRODOLAD WILL COME AND ROSIELASS AND MERRY AND GOLDILOCKS AND PIPPIN AND PERHAPS MORE THAT I CANNOT SEE YOUR HANDS AND YOUR WITS WILL BE NEEDED EVERYWHERE YOU WILL BE THE MAYOR OF COURSE AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO BE AND THE MOST FAMOUS GARDENER IN HISTORY AND YOU WILL READ THINGS OUT OF THE RED BOOK AND KEEP ALIVE THE MEMORY OF THE AGE THAT IS GONE SO THAT PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THE GREAT DANGER AND SO LOVE THEIR BELOVED LAND ALL THE MORE AND THAT WILL KEEP YOU AS BUSY AND AS HAPPY AS ANYONE CAN BE AS LONG AS YOUR PART OF THE STORY GOES ON
     COME NOW RIDE WITH ME
     THEN ELROND AND GALADRIEL RODE ON FOR THE THIRD AGE WAS OVER AND THE DAYS OF THE RINGS WERE PASSED AND AN END WAS COME OF THE STORY AND SONG OF THOSE TIMES WITH THEM WENT MANY ELVES OF THE HIGH KINDRED WHO WOULD NO LONGER STAY IN MIDDLEEARTH AND AMONG THEM FILLED WITH A SADNESS THAT WAS YET BLESSED AND WITHOUT BITTERNESS RODE SAM AND FRODO AND BILBO AND THE ELVES DELIGHTED TO HONOUR THEM
     THOUGH THEY RODE THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE SHIRE ALL THE EVENING AND ALL THE NIGHT NONE SAW THEM PASS SAVE THE WILD CREATURES OR HERE AND THERE SOME WANDERER IN THE DARK WHO SAW A SWIFT SHIMMER UNDER THE TREES OR A LIGHT AND SHADOW FLOWING THROUGH THE GRASS AS THE MOON WENT WESTWARD AND WHEN THEY HAD PASSED FROM THE SHIRE GOING ABOUT THE SOUTH SKIRTS OF THE WHITE DOWNS THEY CAME TO THE FAR DOWNS AND TO THE TOWERS AND LOOKED ON THE DISTANT SEA AND SO THEY RODE DOWN AT LAST TO MITHLOND TO THE GREY HAVENS IN THE LONG FIRTH OF LUNE
     AS THEY CAME TO THE GATES CIRDAN THE SHIPWRIGHT CAME FORTH TO GREET THEM VERY TALL HE WAS AND HIS BEARD WAS LONG AND HE WAS GREY AND OLD SAVE THAT HIS EYES WERE KEEN AS STARS AND HE LOOKED AT THEM AND BOWED AND SAID ALL IS NOW READY
     THEN CIRDAN LED THEM TO THE HAVENS AND THERE WAS A WHITE SHIP LYING AND UPON THE QUAY BESIDE A GREAT GREY HORSE STOOD A FIGURE ROBED ALL IN WHITE AWAITING THEM AS HE TURNED AND CAME TOWARDS THEM FRODO SAW THAT GANDALF NOW WORE OPENLY UPON HIS HAND THE THIRD RING NARYA THE GREAT AND THE STONE UPON IT WAS RED AS FIRE THEN THOSE WHO WERE TO GO WERE GLAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT GANDALF ALSO WOULD TAKE SHIP WITH THEM
     BUT SAM WAS NOW SORROWFUL AT HEART AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IF THE PARTING WOULD BE BITTER MORE GRIEVOUS STILL WOULD BE THE LONG ROAD HOME ALONE BUT EVEN AS THEY STOOD THERE AND THE ELVES WERE GOING ABOARD AND ALL WAS BEING MADE READY TO DEPART UP RODE MERRY AND PIPPIN IN GREAT HASTE AND AMID HIS TEARS PIPPIN LAUGHED
     YOU TRIED TO GIVE US THE SLIP ONCE BEFORE AND FAILED FRODO HE SAID THIS TIME YOU HAVE NEARLY SUCCEEDED BUT YOU HAVE FAILED AGAIN IT WAS NOT SAM THOUGH THAT GAVE YOU AWAY THIS TIME BUT GANDALF HIMSELF
     YES SAID GANDALF FOR IT WILL BE BETTER TO RIDE BACK THREE TOGETHER THAN ONE ALONE WELL HERE AT LAST DEAR FRIENDS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA COMES THE END OF OUR FELLOWSHIP IN MIDDLEEARTH GO IN PEACE I WILL NOT SAY DO NOT WEEP FOR NOT ALL TEARS ARE AN EVIL
     THEN FRODO KISSED MERRY AND PIPPIN AND LAST OF ALL SAM AND WENT ABOARD AND THE SAILS WERE DRAWN UP AND THE WIND BLEW AND SLOWLY THE SHIP SLIPPED AWAY DOWN THE LONG GREY FIRTH AND THE LIGHT OF THE GLASS OF GALADRIEL THAT FRODO BORE GLIMMERED AND WAS LOST AND THE SHIP WENT OUT INTO THE HIGH SEA AND PASSED ON INTO THE WEST UNTIL AT LAST ON A NIGHT OF RAIN FRODO SMELLED A SWEET FRAGRANCE ON THE AIR AND HEARD THE SOUND OF SINGING THAT CAME OVER THE WATER AND THEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT AS IN HIS DREAM IN THE HOUSE OF BOMBADIL THE GREY RAINCURTAIN TURNED ALL TO SILVER GLASS AND WAS ROLLED BACK AND HE BEHELD WHITE SHORES AND BEYOND THEM A FAR GREEN COUNTRY UNDER A SWIFT SUNRISE
     
     BUT TO SAM THE EVENING DEEPENED TO DARKNESS AS HE STOOD AT THE HAVEN AND AS HE LOOKED AT THE GREY SEA HE SAW ONLY A SHADOW ON THE WATERS THAT WAS SOON LOST IN THE WEST THERE STILL HE STOOD FAR INTO THE NIGHT HEARING ONLY THE SIGH AND MURMUR OF THE WAVES ON THE SHORES OF MIDDLEEARTH AND THE SOUND OF THEM SANK DEEP INTO HIS HEART BESIDE HIM STOOD MERRY AND PIPPIN AND THEY WERE SILENT
     AT LAST THE THREE COMPANIONS TURNED AWAY AND NEVER AGAIN LOOKING BACK THEY RODE SLOWLY HOMEWARDS AND THEY SPOKE NO WORD TO ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY CAME BACK TO THE SHIRE BUT EACH HAD GREAT COMFORT IN HIS FRIENDS ON THE LONG GREY ROAD
     AT LAST THEY RODE OVER THE DOWNS AND TOOK THE EAST ROAD AND THEN MERRY AND PIPPIN RODE ON TO BUCKLAND AND ALREADY THEY WERE SINGING AGAIN AS THEY WENT BUT SAM TURNED TO BYWATER AND SO CAME BACK UP THE HILL AS DAY WAS ENDING ONCE MORE AND HE WENT ON AND THERE WAS YELLOW LIGHT AND FIRE WITHIN AND THE EVENING MEAL WAS READY AND HE WAS EXPECTED AND ROSE DREW HIM IN AND SET HIM IN HIS CHAIR AND PUT LITTLE ELANOR UPON HIS LAP
     HE DREW A DEEP BREATH WELL IM BACK HE SAID

      AT THE END OF THE FIRST AGE THE VALAR GAVE TO THE HALFELVEN AN IRREVOCABLE CHOICE TO WHICH KINDRED THEY WOULD BELONG ELROND CHOSE TO BE OF ELVENKIND AND BECAME A MASTER OF WISDOM TO HIM THEREFORE WAS GRANTED THE SAME GRACE AS TO THOSE OF THE HIGH ELVES THAT STILL LINGERED IN MIDDLEEARTH THAT WHEN WEARY AT LAST OF THE MORTAL LANDS THEY COULD TAKE SHIP FROM THE GREY HAVENS AND PASS INTO THE UTTERMOST WEST AND THIS GRACE CONTINUED AFTER THE CHANGE OF THE WORLD BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF ELROND A CHOICE WAS ALSO APPOINTED TO PASS WITH HIM FROM THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD OR IF THEY REMAINED TO BECOME MORTAL AND DIE IN MIDDLEEARTH FOR ELROND THEREFORE ALL CHANCES OF THE WAR OF THE RING WERE FRAUGHT WITH SORROW13

       III ERIADOR ARNOR AND THE HEIRS OF ISILDUR
      

      ERIADOR WAS OF OLD THE NAME OF ALL THE LANDS BETWEEN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND THE BLUE IN THE SOUTH IT WAS BOUNDED BY THE GREYFLOOD AND THE GLANDUIN THAT FLOWS INTO IT ABOVE THARBAD
      AT ITS GREATEST ARNOR INCLUDED ALL ERIADOR EXCEPT THE REGIONS BEYOND THE LUNE AND THE LANDS EAST OF GREYFLOOD AND LOUDWATER IN WHICH LAY RIVENDELL AND HOLLIN BEYOND THE LUNE WAS ELVISH COUNTRY GREEN AND QUIET WHERE NO MEN WENT BUT DWARVES DWELT AND STILL DWELL IN THE EAST SIDE OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS ESPECIALLY IN THOSE PARTS SOUTH OF THE GULF OF LUNE WHERE THEY HAVE MINES THAT ARE STILL IN USE FOR THIS REASON THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO PASS EAST ALONG THE GREAT ROAD AS THEY HAD DONE FOR LONG YEARS BEFORE WE CAME TO THE SHIRE AT THE GREY HAVENS DWELT CIRDAN THE SHIPWRIGHT AND SOME SAY HE DWELLS THERE STILL UNTIL THE LAST SHIP SETS SAIL INTO THE WEST IN THE DAYS OF THE KINGS MOST OF THE HIGH ELVES THAT STILL LINGERED IN MIDDLEEARTH DWELT WITH CIRDAN OR IN THE SEAWARD LANDS OF LINDON IF ANY NOW REMAIN THEY ARE FEW
      THE NORTHKINGDOM AND THE DUNEDAIN
      AFTER ELENDIL AND ISILDUR THERE WERE EIGHT HIGH KINGS OF ARNOR AFTER EARENDUR OWING TO DISSENSIONS AMONG HIS SONS THEIR REALM WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE ARTHEDAIN RHUDAUR AND CARDOLAN ARTHEDAIN WAS IN THE NORTHWEST AND INCLUDED THE LAND BETWEEN BRANDYWINE AND LUNE AND ALSO THE LAND NORTH OF THE GREAT ROAD AS FAR AS THE WEATHER HILLS RHUDAUR WAS IN THE NORTHEAST AND LAY BETWEEN THE ETTENMOORS THE WEATHER HILLS AND THE MISTY MOUNTAINS BUT INCLUDED ALSO THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE HOARWELL AND THE LOUDWATER CARDOLAN WAS IN THE SOUTH ITS BOUNDS BEING THE BRANDYWINE THE GREYFLOOD AND THE GREAT ROAD
      IN ARTHEDAIN THE LINE OF ISILDUR WAS MAINTAINED AND ENDURED BUT THE LINE SOON PERISHED IN CARDOLAN AND RHUDAUR THERE WAS OFTEN STRIFE BETWEEN THE KINGDOMS WHICH HASTENED THE WANING OF THE DUNEDAIN THE CHIEF MATTER OF DEBATE WAS THE POSSESSION OF THE WEATHER HILLS AND THE LAND WESTWARD TOWARDS BREE BOTH RHUDAUR AND CARDOLAN DESIRED TO POSSESS AMON SUL WEATHERTOP WHICH STOOD ON THE BORDERS OF THEIR REALMS FOR THE TOWER OF AMON SUL HELD THE CHIEF PALANT OF THE NORTH AND THE OTHER TWO WERE BOTH IN THE KEEPING OF ARTHEDAIN
      IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF MALVEGIL OF ARTHEDAIN THAT EVIL CAME TO ARNOR FOR AT THAT TIME THE REALM OF ANGMAR AROSE IN THE NORTH BEYOND THE ETTENMOORS ITS LANDS LAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THERE WERE GATHERED MANY EVIL MEN AND ORCS AND OTHER FELL CREATURES THE LORD OF THAT LAND WAS KNOWN AS THE WITCHKING BUT IT WAS NOT KNOWN UNTIL LATER THAT HE WAS INDEED THE CHIEF OF THE RINGWRAITHS WHO CAME NORTH WITH THE PURPOSE OF DESTROYING THE DUNEDAIN IN ARNOR SEEING HOPE IN THEIR DISUNION WHILE GONDOR WAS STRONG
      IN THE DAYS OF ARGELEB SON OF MALVEGIL SINCE NO DESCENDANTS OF ISILDUR REMAINED IN THE OTHER KINGDOMS THE KINGS OF ARTHEDAIN AGAIN CLAIMED THE LORDSHIP OF ALL ARNOR THE CLAIM WAS RESISTED BY RHUDAUR THERE THE DUNEDAIN WERE FEW AND POWER HAD BEEN SEIZED BY AN EVIL LORD OF THE HILLMEN WHO WAS IN SECRET LEAGUE WITH ANGMAR ARGELEB THEREFORE FORTIFIED THE WEATHER HILLS23BUT HE WAS SLAIN IN BATTLE WITH RHUDAUR AND ANGMAR
      ARVELEG SON OF ARGELEB WITH THE HELP OF CARDOLAN AND LINDON DROVE BACK HIS ENEMIES FROM THE HILLS AND FOR MANY YEARS ARTHEDAIN AND CARDOLAN HELD IN FORCE A FRONTIER ALONG THE WEATHER HILLS THE GREAT ROAD AND THE LOWER HOARWELL IT IS SAID THAT AT THIS TIME RIVENDELL WAS BESIEGED
      A GREAT HOST CAME OUT OF ANGMAR IN 1409 AND CROSSING THE RIVER ENTERED CARDOLAN AND SURROUNDED WEATHERTOP THE DUNEDAIN WERE DEFEATED AND ARVELEG WAS SLAIN THE TOWER OF AMON SUL WAS BURNED AND RAZED BUT THE PALANT WAS SAVED AND CARRIED BACK IN RETREAT TO FORNOST RHUDAUR WAS OCCUPIED BY EVIL MEN SUBJECT TO ANGMAR24AND THE DUNEDAIN THAT REMAINED THERE WERE SLAIN OR FLED WEST CARDOLAN WAS RAVAGED ARAPHOR SON OF ARVELEG WAS NOT YET FULLGROWN BUT HE WAS VALIANT AND WITH AID FROM CIRDAN HE REPELLED THE ENEMY FROM FORNOST AND THE NORTH DOWNS A REMNANT OF THE FAITHFUL AMONG THE DUNEDAIN OF CARDOLAN ALSO HELD OUT IN TYRN GORTHAD THE BARROWDOWNS OR TOOK REFUGE IN THE FOREST BEHIND
      IT IS SAID THAT ANGMAR WAS FOR A TIME SUBDUED BY THE ELVENFOLK COMING FROM LINDON AND FROM RIVENDELL FOR ELROND BROUGHT HELP OVER THE MOUNTAINS OUT OF LAND DWELT BESIDE THE GLADDEN BECOMING A RIVERSIDE PEOPLE OF FISHERS
      IN THE DAYS OF ARGELEB II THE PLAGUE CAME INTO ERIADOR FROM THE SOUTHEAST AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF CARDOLAN PERISHED ESPECIALLY IN MINHIRIATH THE HOBBITS AND ALL OTHER PEOPLES SUFFERED GREATLY BUT THE PLAGUE LESSENED AS IT PASSED NORTHWARDS AND THE NORTHERN PARTS OF ARTHEDAIN WERE LITTLE AFFECTED IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT AN END CAME OF THE DUNEDAIN OF CARDOLAN AND EVIL SPIRITS OUT OF ANGMAR AND RHUDAUR ENTERED INTO THE DESERTED MOUNDS AND DWELT THERE
      IT IS SAID THAT THE MOUNDS OF TYRN GORTHAD AS THE BARROWDOWNS WERE CALLED OF OLD ARE VERY ANCIENT AND THAT MANY WERE BUILT IN THE DAYS OF THE OLD WORLD OF THE FIRST AGE BY THE FOREFATHERS OF THE EDAIN BEFORE THEY CROSSED THE BLUE MOUNTAINS INTO BELERIAND OF WHICH LINDON IS ALL THAT NOW REMAINS THOSE HILLS WERE THEREFORE REVERED BY THE DUNEDAIN AFTER THEIR RETURN AND THERE MANY OF THEIR LORDS AND KINGS WERE BURIED SOME SAY THAT THE MOUND IN WHICH THE RINGBEARER WAS IMPRISONED HAD BEEN THE GRAVE OF THE LAST PRINCE OF CARDOLAN WHO FELL IN THE WAR OF 1409
      IN 1974 THE POWER OF ANGMAR AROSE AGAIN AND THE WITCHKING CAME DOWN UPON ARTHEDAIN BEFORE WINTER WAS ENDED HE CAPTURED FORNOST AND DROVE MOST OF THE REMAINING DUNEDAIN OVER THE LUNE AMONG THEM WERE THE SONS OF THE KING BUT KING ARVEDUI HELD OUT UPON THE NORTH DOWNS UNTIL THE LAST AND THEN FLED NORTH WITH SOME OF HIS GUARD AND THEY ESCAPED BY THE SWIFTNESS OF THEIR HORSES
      FOR A WHILE ARVEDUI HID IN THE TUNNELS OF THE OLD DWARFMINES NEAR THE FAR END OF THE MOUNTAINS BUT HE WAS DRIVEN AT LAST BY HUNGER TO SEEK THE HELP OF THE LOSSOTH THE SNOWMEN OF FOROCHEL25SOME OF THESE HE FOUND IN CAMP BY THE SEASHORE BUT THEY DID NOT HELP THE KING WILLINGLY FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO OFFER THEM SAVE A FEW JEWELS WHICH THEY DID CAT VALUE AND THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE WITCHKING WHO THEY SAID COULD MAKE FROST OR THAW AT HIS WILL BUT PARTLY OUT OF PITY FOR THE GAUNT KING AND HIS MEN AND PARTLY OUT OF FEAR OF THEIR WEAPONS THEY GAVE THEM A LITTLE FOOD AND BUILT FOR THEM SNOWHUTS THERE ARVEDUI WAS FORCED TO WAIT HOPING FOR HELP FROM THE SOUTH FOR HIS HORSES HAD PERISHED
      WHEN CIRDAN HEARD FROM ARANARTH SON OF ARVEDUI OF THE KINGS FLIGHT TO THE NORTH HE AT ONCE SENT A SHIP TO FOROCHEL TO SEEK FOR HIM THE SHIP CAME THERE AT LAST AFTER MANY DAYS BECAUSE OF CONTRARY WINDS AND THE MARINERS SAW FROM AFAR THE LITTLE FIRE OF DRIFTWOOD WHICH THE LOST MEN CONTRIVED TO KEEP ALIGHT BUT THE WINTER WAS LONG IN LOOSING ITS GRIP THAT YEAR AND THOUGH IT WAS THEN MARCH THE ICE WAS ONLY BEGINNING TO BREAK AND LAY FAR OUT FROM THE SHORE
      WHEN THE SNOWMEN SAW THE SHIP THEY WERE AMAZED AND AFRAID FOR THEY HAD SEEN NO SUCH SHIP ON THE SEA WITHIN THEIR MEMORIES BUT THEY HAD BECOME NOW MORE FRIENDLY AND THEY DREW THE KING AND THOSE THAT SURVIVED OF HIS COMPANY OUT OVER THE ICE IN THEIR SLIDING CARTS AS FOR AS THEY DARED IN THIS WAY A BOAT FROM THE SHIP WAS ABLE TO REACH THEM
      BUT THE SNOWMEN WERE UNEASY FOR THEY SAID THAT THEY SMELLED DANGER IN THE WIND AND THE CHIEF OF THE LOSSOTH SAID TO ARVEDUI DO NOT MOUNT ON THIS SEAMONSTER IF THEY HAVE THEM LET THE SEAMEN BRING US FOOD AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED AND YOU MAY STAY HERE TILL THE WITCHKING GOES HOME FOR IN SUMMER HIS POWER WANES BUT NOW HIS BREATH IS DEADLY AND HIS COLD ARM IS LONG
      BUT ARVEDUI DID NOT TAKE HIS COUNSEL HE THANKED HIM AND AT PARTING GAVE HIM HIS RING SAYING THIS IS A DUNG OF WORTH BEYOND YOUR RECKONING FOR ITS ANCIENTRY ALONE IT HAS NO POWER SAVE THE ESTEEM IN WHICH THOSE HOLD IT WHO LOVE MY HOUSE IT WILL NOT HELP YOU BUT IF EVER YOU ARE IN NEED MY KIN WILL RANSOM IT WITH GREAT STORE OF ALL THAT YOU DESIRE26
      YET THE COUNSEL OF THE LOSSOTH WAS GOOD BY CHANCE OR BY FORESIGHT FOR THE SHIP HAD NOT REACHED THE OPEN SEA WHEN A GREAT STORM OF WIND AROSE AND CAME WITH BLINDING SNOW OUT OF THE NORTH AND IT DROVE THE SHIP BACK UPON THE ICE AND PILED ICE UP AGAINST IT EVEN THE MARINERS OF CIRDAN WERE HELPLESS AND IN THE NIGHT THE ICE CRUSHED THE HULL AND THE SHIP FOUNDERED SO PERISHED ARVEDUI LASTKING AND WITH HIM THE PALANT WERE BURIED IN THE SEA27IT WAS LONG AFTERWARDS THAT NEWS OF THE SHIPWRECK OF FOROCHEL WAS LEARNED FROM THE SNOWMEN
      THE SHIREFOLK SURVIVED THOUGH WAR SWEPT OVER THEM AND MOST OF THEM FLED INTO HIDING TO THE HELP OF THE KING THEY SENT SOME ARCHERS WHO NEVER RETURNED AND OTHERS WENT ALSO TO THE BATTLE IN WHICH ANGMAR WAS OVERTHROWN OF WHICH MORE IS SAID IN THE ANNALS OF THE SOUTH AFTERWARDS IN THE PEACE THAT FOLLOWED THE SHIREFOLK RULED THEMSELVES AND PROSPERED THEY CHOSE A THAIN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND WERE CONTENT THOUGH FOR A LONG TIME MANY STILL LOOKED FOR THE RETURN OF THE KING BUT AT LAST THAT HOPE WAS FORGOTTEN AND REMAINED ONLY IN THE SAYING WHEN THE KING COMES BACK USED OF SOME GOOD THAT COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED OR OF SOME EVIL THAT COULD NOT BE AMENDED THE FIRST SHIRE THAIN WAS ONE BUCCA OF THE MARISH FROM WHOM THE OLDBUCKS CLAIMED DESCENT HE BECAME THAIN IN 379 OF OUR RECKONING 1979
      AFTER ARVEDUI THE NORTHKINGDOM ENDED FOR THE DUNEDAIN WERE NOW FEW AND ALL THE PEOPLES OF ERIADOR DIMINISHED YET THE LINE OF THE KINGS WAS CONTINUED BY THE CHIEFTAINS OF THE DUNEDAIN OF WHOM ARANARTH SON OF ARVEDUI WAS THE FIRST ARAHAEL HIS SON WAS FOSTERED IN RIVENDELL AND SO WERE ALL THE SONS OF THE CHIEFTAINS AFTER HIM AND THERE ALSO WERE KEPT THE HEIRLOOMS OF THEIR HOUSE THE RING OF BARAHIR THE SHARDS OF NARSIL THE STAR OF ELENDIL AND THE SCEPTRE OF ANNUMINAS28
      WHEN THE KINGDOM ENDED THE DUNEDAIN PASSED INTO THE SHADOWS AND BECAME A SECRET AND WANDERING PEOPLE AND THEIR DEEDS AND LABOURS WERE SELDOM SUNG OR RECORDED LITTLE NOW IS REMEMBERED OF THEM SINCE ELROND DEPARTED ALTHOUGH EVEN BEFORE THE WATCHFUL PEACE ENDED EVIL THINGS AGAIN BEGAN TO ATTACK ERIADOR OR TO INVADE IT SECRETLY THE CHIEFTAINS FOR THE MOST PART LIVED OUT THEIR LONG LIVES ARAGORN I IT IS SAID WAS SLAIN BY WOLVES WHICH EVER AFTER REMAINED A PERIL IN ERIADOR AND ARE NOT YET ENDED IN THE DAYS OF ARAHAD I THE ORCS WHO HAD AS LATER APPEARED LONG BEEN SECRETLY OCCUPYING STRONGHOLDS IN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS SO AS TO BAR ALL THE PASSES INTO ERIADOR SUDDENLY REVEALED THEMSELVES IN 2509 CELEBRIAN WIFE OF ELROND WAS JOURNEYING TO L29SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO IMLADRIS AND THOUGH HEALED IN BODY BY ELROND LOST ALL DELIGHT IN MIDDLEEARTH AND THE NEXT YEAR WENT TO THE HAVENS AND PASSED OVER SEA AND LATER IN THE DAYS OF ARASSUIL ORCS MULTIPLYING AGAIN IN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS BEGIN TO RAVAGE THE LANDS AND THE DUNEDAIN AND THE SONS OF ELROND FOUGHT WITH THEM IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT A LARGE BAND CAME SO FAR WEST AS TO ENTER THE SHIRE AND WERE DRIVEN OFF BY BANDOBRAS TOOK30
      THERE WERE FOURTEEN CHIEFTAINS BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH AND LAST WAS BORN ARAGORN II WHO BECAME AGAIN KING OF BORN GONDOR AND ARNOR OUR KING WE CALL HIM AND WHEN HE COMES NORTH TO HIS HOUSE IN ANNUMINAS RESTORED AND STAYS FOR A WHILE BY LAKE EVENDIM THEN EVERYONE IN THE SHIRE IS GLAD BUT HE DOES NOT ENTER THIS LAND AND BINDS HIMSELF BY THE LAW THAT HE HAS MADE THAT NONE OF THE BIG PEOPLE SHALL PASS ITS BORDERS BUT HE RIDES OFTEN WITH MANY FAIR PEOPLE TO THE GREAT BRIDGE AND THERE HE WELCOMES HIS FRIENDS AND ANY OTHERS WHO WISH TO SEE HIM AND SOME RIDE AWAY WITH HIM AND STAY IN HIS HOUSE AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A MIND THAIN PEREGRIN HAS BEEN THERE MANY TIMES AND SO HAS MASTER SAMWISE THE MAYOR HIS DAUGHTER ELANOR THE FAIR IS ONE OF THE MAIDS OF QUEEN EVENSTAR
      IT WAS THE PRIDE AND WONDER OF THE NORTHERN LINE THAT THOUGH THEIR POWER DEPARTED AND THEIR PEOPLE DWINDLED THROUGH ALL THE MANY GENERATIONS THE SUCCESSION WAS UNBROKEN FROM FATHER TO SON ALSO THOUGH THE LENGTH OF THE LIVES OF THE DUNEDAIN GREW EVER LESS IN MIDDLEEARTH AFTER THE ENDING OF THEIR KINGS THE WANING WAS SWIFTER IN GONDOR AND MANY OF THE CHIEFTAINS OF THE NORTH STILL LIVED TO TWICE THE AGE OF MEN AND FAR BEYOND THE DAYS OF EVEN THE OLDEST AMONGST US ARAGORN INDEED LIVED TO BE TWO HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS OLD LONGER THAN ANY OF HIS LINE SINCE KING ARVEGIL BUT IN ARAGORN ELESSAR THE DIGNITY OF THE KINGS OF OLD WAS RENEWED
     

     

      

       IV GONDOR AND THE HEIRS OF AN
      

      THERE WERE THIRTYONE KINGS IN GONDOR AFTER ANED FOR THE HIGH MEN OF THE SOUTH MARRIED LATE AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE FEW THE FIRST CHILDLESS KING WAS FALASTUR AND THE SECOND NARMACIL I THE SON OF ATANATAR ALCARIN
      IT WAS OSTOHER THE SEVENTH KING WHO REBUILT MINAS ANOR WHERE AFTERWARDS THE KINGS DWELT IN SUMMER RATHER THAN IN OSGILIATH IN HIS TIME GONDOR WAS FIRST ATTACKED BY WILD MEN OUT OF THE EAST BUT TAROSTAR HIS SON DEFEATED THEM AND DROVE THEM OUT AND TOOK THE NAME OF ROMENDACIL EASTVICTOR HE WAS HOWEVER LATER SLAIN IN BATTLE WITH FRESH HORDES OF EASTERLINGS TURAMBAR HIS SON AVENGED HIM AND WON MUCH TERRITORY EASTWARDS
      WITH TARANNON THE TWELFTH KING BEGAN THE LINE OF THE SHIPKINGS WHO BUILT NAVIES AND EXTENDED THE SWAY OF GONDOR ALONG THE COASTS WEST AND SOUTH OF THE MOUTHS OF ANDUIN TO COMMEMORATE HIS VICTORIES AS CAPTAIN OF THE HOSTS TARANNON TOOK THE CROWN IN THE NAME OF FALASTUR LORD OF THE COASTS
      E31BUT EIL FELL IN BATTLE IN HARADWAITH
      FOR MANY YEARS UMBAR WAS INVESTED BUT COULD NOT BE TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE SEAPOWER OF GONDOR CIRYAHER SON OF CIRYANDIL BIDED HIS TIME AND AT LAST WHEN HE HAD GATHERED STRENGTH HE CAME DOWN FROM THE NORTH BY SEA AND BY LAND AND CROSSING THE RIVER HARNEN HIS ARMIES UTTERLY DEFEATED THE MEN OF THE HARAD AND THEIR KINGS WERE COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OVERLORDSHIP OF GONDOR 1050 CIRYAHER THEN TOOK THE NAME OF HYARMENDACIL SOUTHVICTOR
      THE MIGHT OF HYARMENDACIL NO ENEMY DARED TO CONTEST DURING THE REMAINDER OF HIS LONG REIGN HE WAS KING FOR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTYFOUR YEARS THE LONGEST REIGN BUT ONE OF ALL THE LINE OF ANALES OF ANDUIN ACKNOWLEDGED ITS AUTHORITY AND THE KINGS OF THE HARAD DID HOMAGE TO GONDOR AND THEIR SONS LIVED AS HOSTAGES IN THE COURT OF ITS KING MORDOR WAS DESOLATE BUT WAS WATCHED OVER BY GREAT FORTRESSES THAT GUARDED THE PASSES
      SO ENDED THE LINE OF THE SHIPKINGS ATANATAR ALCARIN SON OF HYARMENDACIL LIVED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR SO THAT MEN SAID PRECIOUS STONES ARE PEBBLES IN GONDOR FOR CHILDREN TO PLAY WITH BUT ATANATAR LOVED EASE AND DID NOTHING TO MAINTAIN THE POWER THAT HE HAD INHERITED AND HIS TWO SONS WERE OF LIKE TEMPER THE WANING OF GONDOR HAD ALREADY BEGUN BEFORE HE DIED AND WAS DOUBTLESS OBSERVED BY ITS ENEMIES THE WATCH UPON MORDOR WAS NEGLECTED NONETHELESS IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE DAYS OF VALACAR THAT THE FIRST GREAT EVIL CAME UPON GONDOR THE CIVIL WAR OF THE KINSTRIFE IN WHICH GREAT LOSS AND RUIN WAS CAUSED AND NEVER FULLY REPAIRED
      MINALCAR SON OF CALMACIL WAS A MAN OF GREAT VIGOUR AND IN 1240 NARMACIL TO RID HIMSELF OF ALL CARES MADE HIM REGENT OF THE REALM FROM THAT TIME ONWARDS HE GOVERNED GONDOR IN THE NAME OF THE KINGS UNTIL HE SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER HIS CHIEF CONCERN WAS WITH THE NORTHMEN
      THESE HAD INCREASED GREATLY IN THE PEACE BROUGHT BY THE POWER OF GONDOR THE KINGS SHOWED THEM FAVOUR SINCE THEY WERE THE NEAREST IN KIN OF LESSER MEN TO THE DUNEDAIN BEING FOR THE MOST PART DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PEOPLES FROM WHOM THE EDAIN OF OLD HAD COME AND THEY GAVE THEM WIDE LANDS BEYOND ANDUIN SOUTH OF GREENWOOD THE GREAT TO BE A DEFENCE AGAINST MEN OF THE EAST FOR IN THE PAST THE ATTACKS OF THE EASTERLINGS HAD COME MOSTLY OVER THE PLAIN BETWEEN THE INLAND SEA AND THE ASH MOUNTAINS
      IN THE DAYS OF NARMACIL I THEIR ATTACKS BEGAN AGAIN THOUGH AT FIRST WITH LITTLE FORCE BUT IT WAS LEARNED BY THE REGENT THAT THE NORTHMEN DID NOT ALWAYS REMAIN TRUE TO GONDOR AND SOME WOULD JOIN FORCES WITH THE EASTERLINGS EITHER OUT OF GREED FOR SPOIL OR IN THE FURTHERANCE OF FEUDS AMONG THEIR PRINCES MINALCAR THEREFORE IN 1248 LED OUT A GREAT FORCE AND BETWEEN RHOVANION AND THE INLAND SEA HE DEFEATED A LARGE ARMY OF THE EASTERLINGS AND DESTROYED ALL THEIR CAMPS AND SETTLEMENTS EAST OF THE SEA HE THEN TOOK THE NAME OF ROMENDACIL
      ON HIS RETURN ROMENDACIL FORTIFIED THE WEST SHORE OF ANDUIN AS FAR AS THE INFLOW OF THE LIMLIGHT AND FORBADE ANY STRANGER TO PASS DOWN THE RIVER BEYOND THE EMYN MUIL HE IT WAS THAT BUILT THE PILLARS OF THE ARGONATH AT THE ENTRANCE TO NEN HITHOEL BUT SINCE HE NEEDED MEN AND DESIRED TO STRENGTHEN THE BOND BETWEEN GONDOR AND THE NORTHMEN HE TOOK MANY OF THEM INTO HIS SERVICE AND GAVE TO SOME HIGH RANK IN HIS ARMIES
      ROMENDACIL SHOWED ESPECIAL FAVOUR TO VIDUGAVIA WHO HAD AIDED HIM IN THE WAR HE CALLED HIMSELF KING OF RHOVANION AND WAS INDEED THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE NORTHERN PRINCES THOUGH HIS OWN REALM LAY BETWEEN GREENWOOD AND THE RIVER CELDUIN32IN 1250 ROMENDACIL SENT HIS SON VALACAR AS AN AMBASSADOR TO DWELL FOR A WHILE WITH VIDUGAVIA AND MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LANGUAGE MANNERS AND POLICIES OF THE NORTHMEN BUT VALACAR FAR EXCEEDED HIS FATHERS DESIGNS HE GREW TO LOVE THE NORTHERN LANDS AND PEOPLE AND HE MARRIED VIDUMAVI DAUGHTER OF VIDUGAVIA IT WAS SOME YEARS BEFORE HE RETURNED FROM THIS MARRIAGE CAME LATER THE WAR OF THE KINSTRIFE
      FOR THE HIGH MEN OF GONDOR ALREADY LOOKED ASKANCE AT THE NORTHMEN AMONG THEM AND IT WAS A THING UNHEARD OF BEFORE THAT THE HEIR TO THE CROWN OR ANY SON OF THE KING SHOULD WED ONE OF LESSER AND ALIEN RACE THERE WAS ALREADY REBELLION IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES WHEN KING VALACAR GREW OLD HIS QUEEN HAD BEEN A FAIR AND NOBLE LADY BUT SHORTLIVED ACCORDING TO THE FATE OF LESSER MEN AND THE DUNEDAIN FEARED THAT HER DESCENDANTS WOULD PROVE THE SAME AND FALL FROM THE MAJESTY OF THE KINGS OF MEN ALSO THEY WERE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT AS LORD HER SON WHO THOUGH HE WAS NOW CALLED ELDACAR HAD BEEN BORN IN AN ALIEN COUNTRY AND WAS NAMED IN HIS YOUTH VINITHARYA A NAME OF HIS MOTHERS PEOPLE
      THEREFORE WHEN ELDACAR SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER THERE WAS WAR IN GONDOR BUT ELDACAR DID NOT PROVE EASY TO THRUST FROM HIS HERITAGE TO THE LINEAGE OF GONDOR HE ADDED THE FEARLESS SPIRIT OF THE NORTHMEN HE WAS HANDSOME AND VALIANT AND SHOWED NO SIGN OF AGEING MORE SWIFTLY THAN HIS FATHER WHEN THE CONFEDERATES LED BY DESCENDANTS OF THE KINGS ROSE AGAINST HIM HE OPPOSED THEM TO THE END OF HIS STRENGTH AT LAST HE WAS BESIEGED IN OSGILIATH AND HELD IT LONG UNTIL HUNGER AND THE GREATER FORCES OF THE REBELS DROVE HIM OUT LEAVING THE CITY IN FLAMES IN THAT SIEGE AND BURNING THE TOWER OF THE STONE OF OSGILIATH WAS DESTROYED AND THE PALANT WAS LOST IN THE WATERS
      BUT ELDACAR ELUDED HIS ENEMIES AND CAME TO THE NORTH TO HIS KINSFOLK IN RHOVANION MANY GATHERED TO HIM THERE BOTH OF THE NORTHMEN IN THE SERVICE OF GONDOR AND OF THE DUNEDAIN OF THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE REALM FOR MANY OF THE LATTER HAD LEARNED TO ESTEEM HIM AND MANY MORE CAME TO HATE HIS USURPER THIS WAS CASTAMIR GRANDSON OF CALIMEHTAR YOUNGER BROTHER OF ROMENDACIL II HE WAS NOT ONLY ONE OF THOSE NEAREST BY BLOOD TO THE CROWN BUT BE HAD THE GREATEST FOLLOWING OF ALL THE REBELS FOR HE WAS THE CAPTAIN OF SHIPS AND WAS SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE COASTS AND OF THE GREAT HAVENS OF PELARGIR AND UMBAR
      CASTAMIR HAD NOT LONG SAT UPON THE THRONE BEFORE HE PROVED HIMSELF HAUGHTY AND UNGENEROUS HE WAS A CRUEL MAN AS BE HAD FIRST SHOWN IN THE TAKING OF OSGILIATH HE CAUSED ORNENDIL SON OF ELDACAR WHO WAS CAPTURED TO BE PUT TO DEATH AND THE SLAUGHTER AND DESTRUCTION DONE IN THE CITY AT HIS BIDDING FAR EXCEEDED THE NEEDS OF WAR THIS WAS REMEMBERED IN MINAS ANOR AND IN ITHILIEN AND THERE LOVE FOR CASTAMIR WAS FURTHER LESSENED WHEN IT BECAME SEEN THAT HE CARED LITTLE FOR THE LAND AND THOUGHT ONLY OF THE FLEETS AND PURPOSED TO REMOVE THE KINGS SEAT TO PELARGIR
      THUS HE HAD BEEN KING ONLY TEN YEARS WHEN ELDACAR SEEING HIS TIME CAME WITH A GREAT ARMY OUT OF THE NORTH AND FOLK FLOCKED TO HIM FROM CALENARDHON AND ANEY HELD OUT LONG AT PELARGIR
      WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED THERE ALL THE FORCE THAT THEY COULD FOR ELDACAR HAD NO SHIPS TO BESET THEM BY SEA THEY SAILED AWAY AND ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES AT UMBAR THERE THEY MADE A REFUGE FOR ALL THE ENEMIES OF THE KING AND A LORDSHIP INDEPENDENT OF HIS CROWN UMBAR REMAINED AT WAR WITH GONDOR FOR MANY LIVES OF MEN A THREAT TO ITS COASTLANDS AND TO ALL TRAFFIC ON THE SEA IT WAS NEVER AGAIN COMPLETELY SUBDUED UNTIL THE DAYS OF ELESSAR AND THE REGION OF SOUTH GONDOR BECAME A DEBATABLE LAND BETWEEN THE CORSAIRS AND THE KINGS
      THE LOSS OF UMBAR WAS GRIEVOUS TO GONDOR NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE REALM WAS DIMINISHED IN THE SOUTH AND ITS HOLD UPON THE MEN OF THE HARAD WAS LOOSENED BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THERE THAT ARPHARAZHEY HAD SET A GREAT WHITE PILLAR AS A MONUMENT IT WAS CROWNED WITH A GLOBE OF CRYSTAL THAT TOOK THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND OF THE MOON AND SHONE LIKE A BRIGHT STAR THAT COULD BE SEEN IN CLEAR WEATHER EVEN ON THE COASTS OF GONDOR OR FAR OUT UPON THE WESTERN SEA SO IT STOOD UNTIL AFTER THE SECOND ARISING OF SAURON WHICH NOW APPROACHED UMBAR FELL UNDER THE DOMINATION OF HIS SERVANTS AND THE MEMORIAL OF HIS HUMILIATION WAS THROWN DOWN
      AFTER THE RETURN OF ELDACAR THE BLOOD OF THE KINGLY HOUSE AND OTHER HOUSES OF THE DUNEDAIN BECAME MORE MINGLED WITH THAT OF LESSER MEN FOR MANY OF THE GREAT HAD BEEN SLAIN IN THE KINSTRIFE WHILE ELDACAR SHOWED FAVOUR TO THE NORTHMEN BY WHOSE HELP HE HAD REGAINED THE CROWN AND THE PEOPLE OF GONDOR WERE REPLENISHED BY GREAT NUMBERS THAT CAME FROM RHOVANION
      THIS MINGLING DID NOT AT FIRST HASTEN THE WANING OF THE DUNEDAIN AS HAD BEEN FEARED BUT THE WANING STILL PROCEEDED LITTLE BY LITTLE AS IT HAD BEFORE FOR NO DOUBT IT WAS DUE ABOVE ALL TO MIDDLEEARTH ITSELF AND TO THE SLOW WITHDRAWING OF THE GIFTS OF THE N
      THE SECOND AND GREATEST EVIL CAME UPON GONDOR IN THE REIGN OF TELEMNAR THE TWENTYSIXTH KING WHOSE FATHER MINARDIL SON OF ELDACAR WAS SLAIN AT PELARGIR BY THE CORSAIRS OF UMBAR THEY WERE LED BY ANGAMAITE AND SANGAHYANDO THE GREATGRANDSONS OF CASTAMIR SOON AFTER A DEADLY PLAGUE CAME WITH DARK WINDS OUT OF THE EAST THE KING AND ALL HIS CHILDREN DIED AND GREAT NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE OF GONDOR ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT LIVED IN OSGILIATH THEN FOR WEARINESS AND FEWNESS OF MEN THE WATCH ON THE BORDERS OF MORDOR CEASED AND THE FORTRESSES THAT GUARDED THE PASSES WERE UNMANNED
      LATER IT WAS NOTED THAT THESE THINGS HAPPENED EVEN AS THE SHADOW GREW DEEP IN GREENWOOD AND MANY EVIL THINGS REAPPEARED SIGNS OF THE ARISING OF SAURON IT IS TRUE THAT THE ENEMIES OF GONDOR ALSO SUFFERED OR THEY MIGHT HAVE OVERWHELMED IT IN ITS WEAKNESS BUT SAURON COULD WAIT AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE OPENING OF MORDOR WAS WHAT HE CHIEFLY DESIRED
      WHEN KING TELEMNAR DIED THE WHITE TREE OF MINAS ANOR ALSO WITHERED AND DIED BUT TARONDOR HIS NEPHEW WHO SUCCEEDED HIM REPLANTED A SEEDLING IN THE CITADEL HE IT WAS WHO REMOVED THE KINGS HOUSE PERMANENTLY TO MINAS ANOR FOR OSGILIATH WAS NOW PARTLY DESERTED AND BEGAN TO FALL INTO RUIN FEW OF THOSE WHO HAD FLED FROM THE PLAGUE INTO ITHILIEN OR TO THE WESTERN DALES WERE WILLING TO RETURN
      TARONDOR COMING YOUNG TO THE THRONE HAD THE LONGEST REIGN OF ALL THE KINGS OF GONDOR BUT HE COULD ACHIEVE LITTLE MORE THAN THE REORDERING OF HIS REALM WITHIN AND THE SLOW NURSING OF ITS STRENGTH BUT TELUMEHTAR HIS SON REMEMBERING THE DEATH OF MINARDIL AND BEING TROUBLED BY THE INSOLENCE OF THE CORSAIRS WHO RAIDED HIS COASTS EVEN AS FAR AS THE ANFALAS GATHERED HIS FORCES AND IN 1810 TOOK UMBAR BY STORM IN THAT WAR THE LAST DESCENDANTS OF CASTAMIR PERISHED AND UMBAR WAS AGAIN HELD FOR A WHILE BY THE KINGS TELUMEHTAR ADDED TO HIS NAME THE TITLE UMBARDACIL BUT IN THE NEW EVILS THAT SOON BEFELL GONDOR UMBAR WAS AGAIN LOST AND FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE MEN OF THE HARAD
      THE THIRD EVIL WAS THE INVASION OF THE WAINRIDERS WHICH SAPPED THE WANING STRENGTH OF GONDOR IN WARS THAT LASTED FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS THE WAINRIDERS WERE A PEOPLE OR A CONFEDERACY OF MANY PEOPLES THAT CAME FROM THE EAST BUT THEY WERE STRONGER AND BETTER ARMED THAN ANY THAT HAD APPEARED BEFORE THEY JOURNEYED IN GREAT WAINS AND THEIR CHIEFTAINS FOUGHT IN CHARIOTS STIRRED UP AS WAS AFTERWARDS SEEN BY THE EMISSARIES OF SAURON THEY MADE A SUDDEN ASSAULT UPON GONDOR AND KING NARMACIL II WAS SLAIN IN BATTLE WITH THEM BEYOND ANDUIN IN 1856 THE PEOPLE OF EASTERN AND SOUTHERN RHOVANION WERE ENSLAVED AND THE FRONTIERS OF GONDOR WERE FOR THAT TIME WITHDRAWN TO THE ANDUIN AND THE EMYN MUIL AT THIS TIME IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE RINGWRAITHS REENTERED MORDOR
      CALIMEHTAR SON OF NARMACIL II HELPED BY A REVOLT IN RHOVANION AVENGED HIS FATHER WITH A GREAT VICTORY OVER THE EASTERLINGS UPON DAGORLAD IN 1899 AND FOR A WHILE THE PERIL WAS AVERTED IT WAS IN THE REIGN OF ARAPHANT IN THE NORTH AND OF ONDOHER SON OF CALIMEHTAR IN THE SOUTH THAT THE TWO KINGDOMS AGAIN TOOK COUNSEL TOGETHER AFTER LONG SILENCE AND ESTRANGEMENT FOR AT LAST THEY PERCEIVED THAT SOME SINGLE POWER AND WILL WAS DIRECTING THE ASSAULT FROM MANY QUARTERS UPON THE SURVIVORS OF N
      MANY OF THE WAINRIDERS NOW PASSED SOUTH OF MORDOR AND MADE ALLIANCE WITH MEN OF KHAND AND OF NEAR HARAD AND IN THIS GREAT ASSAULT FROM NORTH AND SOUTH GONDOR CAME NEAR TO DESTRUCTION IN 1944 KING ONDOHER AND BOTH HIS SONS ARTAMIR AND FARAMIR FELL IN BATTLE NORTH OF THE MORANNON AND THE ENEMY POURED INTO ITHILIEN BUT ESTING AND REVELLING BELIEVING THAT GONDOR WAS OVERTHROWN AND THAT NOTHING REMAINED BUT TO TAKE THE SPOIL E
      ON THE DEATH OF ONDOHER AND HIS SONS ARVEDUI OF THE NORTHKINGDOM CLAIMED THE CROWN OF GONDOR AS THE DIRECT DESCENDANT OF ISILDUR AND AS THE HUSBAND OF FIRIEL ONLY SURVIVING CHILD OF ONDOHER THE CLAIM WAS REJECTED IN THIS PELENDUR THE STEWARD OF KING ONDOHER PLAYED THE CHIEF PART
      THE COUNCIL OF GONDOR ANSWERED THE CROWN AND ROYALTY OF GONDOR BELONGS SOLELY TO THE HEIRS OF MENELDIL SON OF AN
      TO THIS ARVEDUI REPLIED ELENDIL HAD TWO SONS OF WHOM ISILDUR WAS THE ELDER AND THE HEIR OF HIS FATHER WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE NAME OF ELENDIL STANDS TO THIS DAY AT THE HEAD OF THE LINE OF THE KINGS OF GONDOR SINCE HE WAS ACCOUNTED THE HIGH KING OF ALL THE LANDS OF THE DUNEDAIN WHILE ELENDIL STILL LIVED THE CONJOINT RULE IN THE SOUTH WAS COMMITTED TO HIS SONS BUT WHEN ELENDIL FELL ISILDUR DEPARTED TO TAKE UP THE HIGH KINGSHIP OF HIS FATHER AND COMMITTED THE RULE IN THE SOUTH IN LIKE MANNER TO THE SON OF HIS BROTHER HE DID NOT RELINQUISH HIS ROYALTY IN GONDOR NOR INTEND THAT THE REALM OF ELENDIL SHOULD BE DIVIDED FOR EVER
      MOREOVER IN N33
      TO THIS GONDOR MADE NO ANSWER THE CROWN WAS CLAIMED BY ELL TO OPPOSE THE CHOICE OF THE DUNEDAIN OF GONDOR YET THE CLAIM WAS NEVER FORGOTTEN BY HIS DESCENDANTS EVEN WHEN THEIR KINGSHIP HAD PASSED AWAY FOR THE TIME WAS NOW DRAWING NEAR WHEN THE NORTHKINGDOM WOULD COME TO AN END
      ARVEDUI WAS INDEED THE LAST KING AS HIS NAME SIGNIFIES IT IS SAID THAT THIS NAME WAS GIVEN TO HIM AT HIS BIRTH BY MALBETH THE SEER WHO SAID TO HIS FATHER ARVEDUI YOU SHALL CALL HIM FOR HE WILL BE THE LAST IN ARTHEDAIN THOUGH A CHOICE WILL COME TO THE DUNEDAIN AND IF THEY TAKE THE ONE THAT SEEMS LESS HOPEFUL THEN YOUR SON WILL CHANGE HIS NAME AND BECOME KING OF A GREAT REALM IF NOT THEN MUCH SORROW AND MANY LIVES OF MEN SHALL PASS UNTIL THE DUNEDAIN ARISE AND ARE UNITED AGAIN
      IN GONDOR ALSO ONE KING ONLY FOLLOWED E
      HE SENT MESSAGES TO ARVEDUI ANNOUNCING THAT HE RECEIVED THE CROWN OF GONDOR ACCORDING TO THE LAWS AND THE NEEDS OF THE SOUTHKINGDOM BUT I DO NOT FORGET THE LOYALTY OF ARNOR NOR DENY OUR KINSHIP NOR WISH THAT THE REALMS OF ELENDIL SHOULD BE ESTRANGED I WILL SEND TO YOUR AID WHEN YOU HAVE NEED SO FAR AS I AM ABLE
      IT WAS HOWEVER LONG BEFORE ETCHKING WAS PREPARING A LAST STROKE AGAINST IT THEN E
      BUT WHEN EARNUR CAME TO THE GREY HAVENS THERE WAS JOY AND GREAT WONDER AMONG BOTH ELVES AND MEN SO GREAT IN DRAUGHT AND SO MANY WERE HIS SHIPS THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY FIND HARBOURAGE THOUGH BOTH THE HARLOND AND THE FORLOND ALSO WERE FILLED AND FROM THEM DESCENDED AN ARMY OF POWER WITH MUNITION AND PROVISION FOR A WAR OF GREAT KINGS OR SO IT SEEMED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH THOUGH THIS WAS BUT A SMALL SENDINGFORCE OF THE WHOLE MIGHT OF GONDOR MOST OF ALL THE HORSES WERE PRAISED FOR MANY OF THEM CAME FROM THE VALES OF ANDUIN AND WITH THEMWERE RIDERS TALL AND FAIR AND PROUD PRINCES OF RHOVANION
      THEN CIRDAN SUMMONED ALL WHO WOULD COME TO HIM FROM LINDON OR ARNOR AND WHEN ALL WAS READY THE HOST CROSSED THE LUNE AND MARCHED NORM TO CHALLENGE THE WITCHKING OF ANGMAR HE WAS NOW DWELLING IT IS SAID IN FORNOST WHICH HE HAD FILLED WITH EVIL FOLK USURPING THE HOUSE AND RULE OF THE KINGS IN HIS PRIDE HE DID NOT AWAIT THE ONSET OF HIS ENEMIES IN HIS STRONGHOLD BUT WENT OUT TO MEET THEM THINKING TO SWEEP THEM AS OTHERS BEFORE INTO THE LUNE
      BUT THE HOST OF THE WEST CAME DOWN ON HIM OUT OF THE HILLS OF EVENDIM AND WERE WAS A GREAT BATTLE ON THE PLAIN BETWEEN NENUIAL AND THE NORTH DOWNS THE FORCES OF ANGMAR WERE ALREADY GIVING WAY AND RETREATING TOWARDS FORNOST WHEN THE MAIN BODY OF THE HORSEMEN THAT HAD PASSED ROUND THE HILLS CAME DOWN FROM THE NORTH AND SCATTERED THEM IN A GREAT ROUT THEN THE WITCHKING WITH ALL THAT HE COULD GATHER FROM THE WRECK FLED NORTHWARDS SEEKING HIS OWN LAND OF ANGMAR BEFORE HE COULD GAIN THE SHELTER OF CARN DUM THE CAVALRY OF GONDOR OVERTOOK HIM WITH EARNUR RIDING AT THEIR HEAD AT THE SAME TIME A FORCE UNDER GLORFINDEL THE ELFLORD CAME UP OUT OF RIVENDELL THEN SO UTTERLY WAS ANGMAR DEFEATED THAT NOT A MAN NOR AN ORC OF THAT REALM REMAINED WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS
      BUT IT IS SAID THAT WHEN AU WAS LOST SUDDENLY THE WITCHKING HIMSELF APPEARED BLACKROBED AND BLACKMASKED UPON A BLACK HORSE FEAR FELL UPON ALL WHO BEHELD HIM BUT HE SINGLED OUT THE CAPTAIN OF GONDOR FOR THE FULLNESS OF HIS HATRED AND WITH A TERRIBLE CRY HE RODE STRAIGHT UPON HIM EARNUR WOULD HAVE WITHSTOOD HIM BUT HIS HORSE COULD NOT ENDURE THAT ONSET AND IT SWERVED AND BORE HIM FAR AWAY BEFORE HE COULD MASTER IT
      THEN THE WITCHKING LAUGHED AND NONE THAT HEARD IT EVER FORGOT THE HORROR OF THAT CRY BUT GLORFINDEL RODE UP THEN ON HIS WHITE HORSE AND IN THE MIDST OF HIS LAUGHTER THE WITCHKING TURNED TO FLIGHT AND PASSED INTO THE SHADOWS FOR NIGHT CAME DOWN ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND HE WAS LOST AND NONE SAW WHITHER HE WENT
      EARNUR NOW RODE BACK BUT GLORFINDEL LOOKING INTO THE GATHERING DARK SAID DO NOT PURSUE HIM HE WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS LAND FAR OFF YET IS HIS DOOM AND NOT BY THE HAND OF MAN WILL HE FALL THESE WORDS MANY REMEMBERED BUT EARNUR WAS ANGRY DESIRING ONLY TO BE AVENGED FOR HIS DISGRACE
      SO ENDED THE EVIL REALM OF ANGMAR AND SO DID EARNUR CAPTAIN OF GONDOR EARN THE CHIEF HATRED OF THE WITCHKING BUT MANY YEARS WERE STILL TO PASS BEFORE THAT WAS REVEALED
      IT WAS THUS IN THE REIGN OF KING ECAPTURED THE PALANT OF THE TOWER THEY WERE NOT EXPELLED WHILE THE THIRD AGO LASTED AND MINAS ITHIL BECAME A PLACE OF FEAR AND WAS RENAMED MINAS MORGUL MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT STILL REMAINED IN ITHILIEN DESERTED IT
      EARNUR WAS A MAN LIKE HIS FATHER IN VALOUR BUT NOT IN WISDOM HE WAS A MAN OF STRONG BODY AND HOT MOOD BUT HE WOULD TAKE NO WIFE FOR HIS ONLY PLEASURE WAS IN FIGHTING OR IN THE EXERCISE OF ARMS HIS PROWESS WAS SUCH THAT NONE IN GONDOR COULD STAND AGAINST HIM IN THOSE WEAPONSPORTS IN WHICH HE DELIGHTED SEEMING RATHER A CHAMPION THAN A CAPTAIN OR KING AND RETAINING HIS VIGOUR AND SKILL TO A LATER AGE THAN WAS THEN USUAL
      WHEN EARNUR RECEIVED THE CROWN IN 2043 THE KING OF MINAS MORGUL CHALLENGED HIM TO SINGLE COMBAT TAUNTING HIM THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO STAND BEFORE HIM IN BATTLE IN THE NORTH FOR THAT TIME MARDIL THE STEWARD RESTRAINED THE WRATH OF THE KING MINAS ANOR WHICH HAD BECOME THE CHIEF CITY OF THE REALM SINCE THE DAYS OF KING TELEMNAR AND THE RESIDENCE OF THE KINGS WAS NOW RENAMED MINAS TIRITH AS THE CITY EVER ON GUARD AGAINST THE EVIL OF MORGUL
      EARNUR HAD HELD THE CROWN ONLY SEVEN YEARS WHEN THE LORD OF MORGUL REPEATED HIS CHALLENGE TAUNTING THE KING THAT TO THE FAINT HEART OF HIS YOUTH HE HAD NOW ADDED THE WEAKNESS OF AGE THEN MARDIL COULD NO LONGER RESTRAIN HIM AND HE RODE WITH A SMALL ESCORT OF KNIGHTS TO THE GATE OF MINAS MORGUL NONE OF THAT RIDING WERE EVER HEARD OF AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED IN GONDOR THAT THE FAITHLESS ENEMY HAD TRAPPED THE KING AND THAT HE HAD DIED IN TORMENT IN MINAS MORGUL BUT SINCE THERE WERE NO WITNESSES OF HIS DEATH MARDIL THE GOOD STEWARD RULED GONDOR IN HIS NAME FOR MANY YEARS
      NOW THE DESCENDANTS OF THE KINGS HAD BECOME FEW THEIR NUMBERS HAD BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED IN THE KINSTRIFE WHEREAS SINCE THAT TIME THE KINGS HAD BECOME JEALOUS AND WATCHFUL OF THOSE NEAR AKIN OFTEN THOSE ON WHOM SUSPICION FELL HAD FLED TO UMBAR AND THERE JOINED THE REBELS WHILE OTHERS HAD RENOUNCED THEIR LINEAGE AND TAKEN WIVES NOT OF NCONTINUED TO RULE GONDOR AND THE CROWN OF ELENDIL LAY IN THE LAP OF KING E
      THE STEWARDS
      THE HOUSE OF THE STEWARDS WAS CALLED THE HOUSE OF HURIN FOR THEY WERE DESCENDANTS OF THE STEWARD OF KING MINARDIL 162134 HURIN OF EMYN ARNEN A MAN OF HIGH N
      EACH NEW STEWARD INDEED TOOK OFFICE WITH THE OATH TO HOLD ROD AND RULE IN THE NAME OF THE KING UNTIL HE SHALL RETURN BUT THESE SOON BECAME WORDS OF RITUAL LITTLE HEEDED FOR THE STEWARDS EXERCISED ALL THE POWER OF THE KINGS YET MANY IN GONDOR STILL BELIEVED THAT A KING WOULD INDEED RETURN IN SOME TIME TO COME AND SOME REMEMBERED THE ANCIENT LINE OF THE NORTH WHICH IT WAS RUMOURED STILL LIVED ON IN THE SHADOWS BUT AGAINST SUCH THOUGHTS THE RULING STEWARDS HARDENED THEIR HEARTS
      NONETHELESS THE STEWARDS NEVER SAT ON THE ANCIENT THRONE AND THEY WORE NO CROWN AND HELD NO SCEPTRE THEY BORE A WHITE ROD ONLY AS THE TOKEN OF THEIR OFFICE AND THEIR BANNER WAS WHITE WITHOUT CHARGE BUT THE ROYAL BANNER HAD BEEN SABLE UPON WHICH WAS DISPLAYED A WHITE TREE IN BLOSSOM BENEATH SEVEN STARS
      AFTER MARDIL VORONWE WHO WAS RECKONED THE FIRST OF THE LINE THERE FOLLOWED TWENTYFOUR RULING STEWARDS OF GONDOR UNTIL THE TIME OF DENETHOR II THE TWENTYSIXTH AND LAST AT FIRST THEY HAD QUIET FOR THOSE WERE THE DAYS OF THE WATCHFUL PEACE DURING WHICH SAURON WITHDREW BEFORE THE POWER OF THE WHITE COUNCIL AND THE RINGWRAITHS REMAINED HIDDEN IN MORGUL VALE BUT FROM THE TIME OF DENETHOR I THERE WAS NEVER FULL PEACE AGAIN AND EVEN WHEN GONDOR HAD NO GREAT OR OPEN WAR ITS BORDERS WERE UNDER CONSTANT THREAT
      IN THE LAST YEARS OF DENETHOR I THE RACE OF URUKS BLACK ORCS OF GREAT STRENGTH FIRST APPEARED OUT OF MORDOR AND IN 2475 THEY SWEPT ACROSS ITHILIEN AND TOOK OSGILIATH BOROMIR SON OF DENETHOR AFTER WHOM BOROMIR OF THE NINE WALKERS WAS LATER NAMED DEFEATED THEM AND REGAINED ITHILIEN BUT OSGILIATH WAS FINALLY RUINED AND ITS GREAT STONEBRIDGE WAS BROKEN NO PEOPLE DWELT THERE AFTERWARDS BOROMIR WAS A GREAT CAPTAIN AND EVEN THE WITCHKING FEARED HIM HE WAS NOBLE AND FAIR OF FACE A MAN STRONG IN BODY AND IN WILL BUT HE RECEIVED A MORGULWOUND IN THAT WAR WHICH SHORTENED HIS DAYS AND HE BECAME SHRUNKEN WITH PAIN AND DIED TWELVE YEAR AFTER HIS FATHER
      AFTER HIM BEGAN THE LONG RULE OF CIRION HE WAS WATCHFUL AND WARY BUT THE REACH OF GONDOR HAD GROWN SHORT AND HE COULD DO LITTLE MORE THAN DEFEND HIS BORDERS WHILE HIS ENEMIES OR THE POWER THAT MOVED THEM PREPARED STROKES AGAINST HIM THAT HE COULD NOT HINDER THE CORSAIRS HARRIED HIS COASTS BUT IT WAS IN THE NORM MAT HIS CHIEF PERIL LAY IN THE WIDE LANDS OF RHOVANION BETWEEN MIRKWOOD AND THE RIVER RUNNING A FIERCE PEOPLE NOW DWELT WHOLLY UNDER THE SHADOW OF DOL GULDUR OFTEN THEY MADE RAIDS THROUGH THE FOREST UNTIL THE VALE OF ANDUIN SOUTH OF THE GLADDEN WAS LARGELY DESERTED THESE BALCHOTH WERE CONSTANTLY INCREASED BY OTHERS OF LIKE KIND THAT CAME IN FROM THE EAST WHEREAS THE PEOPLE OF CALENARDHON HAD DWINDLED CIRION WAS HARD PUT TO IT TO HOLD THE LINE OF THE ANDUIN
      FORESEEING THE STORM CIRION SENT NORTH FOR AID BUT OVERLATE FOR IN THAT YEAR 2510 THE BALCHOTH HAVING BUILT MANY GREAT BOATS AND RAFTS ON THE EAST SHORES OF ANDUIN SWARMED OVER THE RIVER AND SWEPT AWAY THE DEFENDERS AN ARMY MARCHING UP FROM THE SOUTH WAS CUT OFF AND DRIVEN NORTH OVER THE LIMLIGHT AND THERE IT WAS SUDDENLY ATTACKED BY A HORDE OF ORCS FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND PRESSED TOWARDS THE ANDUIN THEN OUT OF THE NORTH THERE CAME HELP BEYOND HOPE AND THE HORNS OF THE ROHIRRIM WERE FIRST HEARD IN GONDOR EORL THE YOUNG CAME WITH HIS RIDERS AND SWEPT AWAY THE ENEMY AND PURSUED THE BALCHOTH TO THE DEATH OVER THE FIELDS OF CALENARDHON CIRION GRANTED TO EORL THAT LAND TO DWELL IN AND HE SWORE TO CIRION THE OATH OF EORL OF FRIENDSHIP AT NEED OR AT CALL TO THE LORDS OF GONDOR
      IN THE DAYS OF BEREN THE NINETEENTH STEWARD AN EVEN GREATER PERIL CAME UPON GONDOR THREE GREAT FLEETS LONG PREPARED CAME UP FROM UMBAR AND THE HARAD AND ASSAILED THE COASTS OF GONDOR IN GREAT FORCE AND THE ENEMY MADE MANY LANDINGS EVEN AS FAR NORTH AS THE MOUTH OF THE ISEN AT THE LAME TIME THE ROHIRRIM WERE ASSAILED FROM THE WEST AND THE EAST AND THEIR LAND WAS OVERRUN AND THEY WERE DRIVEN INTO THE DALES OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS IN THAT YEAR 2758 THE LONG WINTER BEGAN WITH COLD AND GREAT SNOWS OUT OF THE NORTH AND THE EAST WHICH LASTED FOR ALMOST FIVE MONTHS HELM OF ROHAN AND BOTH HIS SONS PERISHED IN THAT WAR AND THERE WAS MISERY AND DEATH IN ERIADOR AND IN ROHAN BUT IN GONDOR SOUTH OF THE MOUNTAINS THINGS WERE LESS EVIL AND BEFORE SPRING CAME BEREGOND SON OF BEREN BAD OVERCOME THE INVADERS AT ONCE HE SENT AID TO ROHAN HE WAS THE GREATEST CAPTAIN THAT HAD ARISEN IN GONDOR SINCE BOROMIR AND WHEN HE SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER 2763 GONDOR BEGAN TO RECOVER ITS STRENGTH BUT ROHAN WAS SLOWER TO BE HEALED OF THE HURTS THAT IT HAD RECEIVED IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT BEREN WELCOMED SARUMAN AND GAVE TO HIM THE KEYS OF ORTHANC AND FROM THAT YEAR ON 2759 SARUMAN DWELT IN ISENGARD
      IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF BEREGOND THAT THE WAR OF THE DWARVES AND ORCS WAS FOUGHT IN THE MISTY MOUNTAINS 2793 9 OF WHICH ONLY RUMOUR CAME SOUTH UNTIL THE ORCS FLEEING FROM NANDUHIRION ATTEMPTED TO CROSS ROHAN AND ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS THERE WAS FIGHTING FOR MANY YEARS IN THE DALES BEFORE THAT DANGER WAS ENDED
      WHEN BELECTHOR II THE TWENTYFIRST STEWARD DIED THE WHITE TREE DIED ALSO IN MINAS TIRITH BUT IT WAS LEFT STANDING UNTIL THE KING RETURNS FOR NO SEEDLING COULD BE FOUND
      IN THE DAYS OF TURIN II THE ENEMIES OF GONDOR BEGAN TO MOVE AGAIN FOR SAURON WAS GROWN AGAIN TO POWER AND THE DAY OF HIS ARISING WAS DRAWING NEAR ALL BUT THE HARDIEST OF ITS PEOPLE DESERTED ITHILIEN AND REMOVED WEST OVER ANDUIN FOR THE LAND WAS INFESTED BY MORDORORCS IT WAS TURIN THAT BUILT SECRET REFUGES FOR HIS SOLDIERS IN ITHILIEN OF WHICH KENNETH ANNUN WAS THE LONGEST GUARDED AND MANNED HE ALSO FORTIFIED AGAIN THE ISLE OF CAIR ANDROS34TO DEFEND ANENDING MANY MEN TO GONDOR WITH THEIR AID TURIN WON A VICTORY AT THE CROSSINGS OF THE POROS BUT THE SONS OF FOLCWINE BOTH FELL IN THE BATTLE THE RIDERS BURIED THEM AFTER THE FASHION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND THEY WERE LAID IN ONE MOUND FOR THEY WERE TWIN BROTHERS LONG IT STOOD HAUDH IN GWANUR HIGH UPON THE SHORE OF THE RIVER AND THE ENEMIES OF GONDOR FEARED TO PASS IT
      TURGON FOLLOWED TURIN BUT OF HIS TIME IT IS CHIEFLY REMEMBERED THAT TWO YEARS ERE HIS DEATH SAURON AROSE AGAIN AND DECLARED HIMSELF OPENLY AND HE REENTERED MORDOR LONG PREPARED FOR HIM THEN THE BARADDUR WAS RAISED ONCE MORE AND MOUNT DOOM BURST INTO FLAME AND THE LAST OF THE FOLK OF ITHILIEN FLED FAR AWAY WHEN TURGON DIED SARUMAN TOOK ISENGARD FOR HIS OWN AND FORTIFIED IT
      ECTHELION II SON OF TURGON WAS A MAN OF WISDOM WITH WHAT POWER WAS LEFT TO HIM HE BEGAN TO STRENGTHEN HIS REALM AGAINST THE ASSAULT OF MORDOR HE ENCOURAGED ALL MEN OF WORTH FROM NEAR OR FAR TO ENTER HIS SERVICE AND TO THOSE WHO PROVED TRUSTWORTHY HE GAVE RANK AND REWARD IN MUCH THAT HE DID HE HAD THE AID AND ADVICE OF A GREAT CAPTAIN WHOM HE LOVED ABOVE ALL THORONGIL MEN CALLED HIM IN GONDOR THE EAGLE OF THE STAR FOR HE WAS SWIFT AND KEENEYED AND WORE A SILVER STAR UPON HIS CLOAK BUT NO ONE KNEW HIS TRUE NAME NOR IN WHAT LAND HE WAS BORN HE CAME TO ECTHELION FROM ROHAN WHERE HE HAD SERVED THE KING THENGEL BUT HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE ROHIRRIM HE WAS A GREAT LEADER OF MEN BY LAND OR BY SEA BUT HE DEPARTED INTO THE SHADOWS WHENCE HE CAME BEFORE THE DAYS OF ECTHELION WERE ENDED
      THORONGIL OFTEN COUNSELLED ECTHELION THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE REBELS IN UMBAR WAS A GREAT PERIL TO GONDOR AND A THREAT TO THE FIEFS OF THE SOUTH THAT WOULD PROVE DEADLY IF SAURON MOVED TO OPEN WAR AT LAST HE GOT LEAVE OF THE STEWARD AND GATHERED A SMALL FLEET AND HE CAME TO UMBAR UNLOOKEDFOR BY NIGHT AND THERE BURNED A GREAT PART OF THE SHIPS OF THE CORSAIRS HE HIMSELF OVERTHREW THE CAPTAIN OF THE HAVEN IN BATTLE UPON THE QUAYS AND THEN HE WITHDREW HIS FLEET WITH SMALL LOSS BUT WHEN THEY CAME BACK TO PELARGIR TO MENS GRIEF AND WONDER HE WOULD NOT RETURN TO MINAS TIRITH WHERE GREAT HONOUR AWAITED HIM
      HE SENT A MESSAGE OF FAREWELL TO ECTHELION SAYING OTHER TASKS NOW CALL ME LORD AND MUCH TIME AND MANY PERILS MUST PASS ERE I COME AGAIN TO GONDOR IF THAT BE MY FATE THOUGH NONE COULD GUESS WHAT THOSE TASKS MIGHT BE NOR WHAT SUMMONS HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS KNOWN WHITHER HE WENT FOR HE TOOK BOAT AND CROSSED OVER ANDUIN AND THERE HE SAID FAREWELL TO HIS COMPANIONS AND WENT ON ALONE AND WHEN HE WAS LAST SEEN HIS FACE WAS TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS OF SHADOW
      THERE WAS DISMAY IN THE CITY AT THE DEPARTURE OF THORONGIL AND TO ALL MEN IT SEEMED A GREAT LOSS UNLESS IT WERE TO DENETHOR THE SON OF ECTHELION A MAN NOW RIPE FOR THE STEWARDSHIP TO WHICH AFTER FOUR YEARS HE SUCCEEDED ON THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER
      DENETHOR II WAS A PROUD MAN TALL VALIANT AND MORE KINGLY THAN ANY MAN THAT HAD APPEARED IN CONDOR FOR MANY LIVES OF MEN AND HE WAS WISE ALSO AND FARSIGHTED AND LEARNED IN LORE INDEED HE WAS AS LIKE TO THORONGIL AS TO ONE OF NEAREST KIN AND YET WAS EVER PLACED SECOND TO THE STRANGER IN THE HEARTS OF MEN AND THE ESTEEM OF HIS FATHER AT THE TIME MANY THOUGHT THAT THORONGIL HAD DEPARTED BEFORE HIS RIVAL BECAME HIS MASTER THOUGH INDEED THORONGIL HAD NEVER HIMSELF VIED WITH DENETHOR NOR HELD HIMSELF HIGHER THAN THE SERVANT OF HIS FATHER AND IN ONE MATTER ONLY WERE THEIR COUNSELS TO THE STEWARD AT VARIANCE THORONGIL OFTEN WARNED ECTHELION NOT TO PUT TRUST IN SARUMAN THE WHITE IN ISENGARD BUT TO WELCOME RATHER GANDALF THE GREY BUT THERE WAS LITTLE LOVE BETWEEN DENETHOR AND GANDALF AND AFTER THE DAYS OF ECTHELION THERE WAS LESS WELCOME FOR THE GREY PILGRIM IN MINAS TIRITH THEREFORE LATER WHEN ALL WAS MADE CLEAR MANY BELIEVED THAT DENETHOR WHO WAS SUBTLE IN MIND AND LOOKED FURTHER AND DEEPER THAN OTHER MEN OF HIS DAY HAD DISCOVERED WHO THIS STRANGER THORONGIL IN TRUTH WAS AND SUSPECTED THAT HE AND MITHRANDIR DESIGNED TO SUPPLANT HIM
      WHEN DENETHOR BECAME STEWARD 2984 HE PROVED A MASTERFUL LORD HOLDING THE RULE OF ALL THINGS IN HIS OWN HAND HE SAID LITTLE HE LISTENED TO COUNSEL AND THEN FOLLOWED HIS OWN MIND HE HAD MARRIED LATE 2976 TAKING AS WIFE FINDUILAS DAUGHTER OF ADRAHIL OF DOT AMROTH SHE WAS A LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY AND GENTLE HEART BUT BEFORE TWELVE YEARS HAD PASSED SHE DIED DENETHOR LOVED HER IN HIS FASHION MORE DEARLY THAN ANY OTHER UNLESS IT WERE THE ELDER OF THE SONS THAT SHE BORE HIM BUT IT SEEMED TO MEN THAT SHE WITHERED IN THE GUARDED CITY AS A FLOWER OF THE SEAWARD VALES SET UPON A BARREN ROCK THE SHADOW IN THE EAST FILLED HER WITH HORROR AND SHE TURNED HER EYES EVER SOUTH TO THE SEA THAT SHE MISSED
      AFTER HER DEATH DENETHOR BECAME MORE GRIM AND SILENT THAN BEFORE AND WOULD SIT LONG ALONE IN HIS TOWER DEEP IN THOUGHT FORESEEING THAT THE ASSAULT OF MORDOR WOULD COME IN HIS TIME IT WAS AFTERWARDS BELIEVED THAT NEEDING KNOWLEDGE BUT BEING PROUD AND TRUSTING IN HIS OWN STRENGTH OF WILL HE DARED TO LOOK IN THE PALANT OF THE WHITE TOWER NONE OF THE STEWARDS HAD DARED TO DO THIS NOR EVEN THE KINGS EPALANT OF ISILDUR CAME INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY FOR THE STONE OF MINAS TIRITH WAS THE PALANT OF AN
      IN THIS WAY DENETHOR GAINED HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT PASSED IN HIS REALM AND FAR BEYOND HIS BORDERS AT WHICH MEN MARVELLED BUT HE BOUGHT THE KNOWLEDGE DEARLY BEING AGED BEFORE HIS TIME BY HIS CONTEST WITH THE WILL OF SAURON THUS PRIDE INCREASED IN DENETHOR TOGETHER WITH DESPAIR UNTIL HE SAW IN ALL THE DEEDS OF THAT TIME ONLY A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE LORD OF THE WHITE TOWER AND THE LORD OF THE BARADDUR AND MISTRUSTED ALL OTHERS WHO RESISTED SAURON UNLESS THEY SERVED HIMSELF ALONE
      SO TIME DREW ON TO THE WAR OF THE RING AND THE SONS OF DENETHOR GREW TO MANHOOD BOROMIR FIVE YEARS THE ELDER BELOVED BY HIS FATHER WAS LIKE HIM IN FACE AND PRIDE BUT IN LITTLE ELSE RATHER HE WAS A MAN AFTER THE SORT OF KING EARNUR OF OLD TAKING NO WIFE AND DELIGHTING CHIEFLY IN ARMS FEARLESS AND STRONG BUT CARING LITTLE FOR LORE SAVE THE TALES OF OLD BATTLES FARAMIR THE YOUNGER WAS LIKE HIM IN LOOKS BUT OTHERWISE IN MIND HE READ THE HEARTS OF MEN AS SHREWDLY AS HIS FATHER BUT WHAT HE READ MOVED HIM SOONER TO PITY THAN TO SCORN HE WAS GENTLE IN BEARING AND A LOVER OF LORE AND OF MUSIC AND THEREFORE BY MANY IN THOSE DAYS HIS COURAGE WAS JUDGED LESS THAN HIS BROTHERS BUT IT WAS NOT SO EXCEPT THAT HE DID NOT SEEK GLORY IN DANGER WITHOUT A PURPOSE HE WELCOMED GANDALF AT SUCH TIMES AS HE CAME TO THE CITY AND HE LEARNED WHAT HE COULD FROM HIS WISDOM AND IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER MATTERS HE DISPLEASED HIS FATHER
      YET BETWEEN THE BROTHERS THERE WAS GREAT LOVE AND HAD BEEN SINCE CHILDHOOD WHEN BOROMIR WAS THE HELPER AND PROTECTOR OF FARAMIR NO JEALOUSY OR RIVALRY HAD ARISEN BETWEEN THEM SINCE FOR THEIR FATHERS FAVOUR OR FOR THE PRAISE OF MEN IT DID NOT SEEM POSSIBLE TO FARAMIR THAT ANY ONE IN GONDOR COULD RIVAL BOROMIR HEIR OF DENETHOR CAPTAIN OF THE WHITE TOWER AND OF LIKE MIND WAS BOROMIR YET IT PROVED OTHERWISE AT THE TEST BUT OF ALL THAT BEFELL THESE THREE IN THE WAR OF THE RING MUCH IS SAID ELSEWHERE AND AFTER THE WAR THE DAYS OF THE RULING STEWARDS CAME TO AN END FOR THE HEIR OF ISILDUR AND AN
     

     

      

       V HERE FOLLOWS A PART OF THE TALE OF ARAGORN AND ARWEN
      

      ARADOR WAS THE GRANDFATHER OF THE KING HIS SON ARATHORN SOUGHT IN MARRIAGE GILRAEN THE FAIR DAUGHTER OF DIRHAEL WHO WAS HIMSELF A DESCENDANT OF ARANARTH TO THIS MARRIAGE DIRHAEL WAS OPPOSED FOR GILRAEN WAS YOUNG AND HAD NOT LEACHED THE AGE AT WHICH THE WOMEN OF THE DUNEDAIN WERE ACCUSTOMED TO MARRY
      MOREOVER HE SAID ARATHORN IS A STERN MAN OF FULL AGE AND WILL BE CHIEFTAIN SOONER THAN MEN LOOKED FOR YET MY HEART FOREBODES MAT HE WILL BE SHORTLIVED
      BUT IVORWEN HIS WIFE WHO WAS ALSO FORESIGHTED ANSWERED THE MORE NEED OF HASTE THE DAYS ARE DARKENING BEFORE THE STORM AND GREAT THINGS ARE TO COME IF THESE TWO WED NOW HOPE MAY BE BORN FOR OUR PEOPLE BUT IF THEY DELAY IT WILL NOT COME WHILE THIS AGE LASTS
      AND IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN ARATHORN AND GILRAEN HAD BEEN MARRIED ONLY ONE YEAR ARADOR WAS TAKEN BY HILLTROLLS IN THE COLDFELLS NORTH OF RIVENDELL AND WAS SLAIN AND ARATHORN BECAME CHIEFTAIN OF THE DUNEDAIN THE NEXT YEAR GILRAEN BORE HIM A SON AND HE WAS CALLED ARAGORN BUT ARAGORN WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD WHEN ARATHORN WENT RIDING AGAINST THE ORCS WITH THE SONS OF ELROND AND HE WAS SLAIN BY AN ORCARROW THAT PIERCED HIS EYE AND SO HE PROVED INDEED SHORTLIVED FOR ONE OF HIS RACE BEING BUT SIXTY YEARS OLD WHEN BEFELL
      THEN ARAGORN BEING NOW THE HEIR OF ISILDUR WAS TAKEN WITH HIS MOTHER TO DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF ELROND AND ELROND TOOK THE PLACE OF HIS FATHER AND CAME TO LOVE HIM AS A SON OF HIS OWN BUT HE WAS CALLED ESTEL THAT IS HOPE AND HIS TRUE NAME AND LINEAGE WERE KEPT SECRET AT THE BIDDING OF ELROND FOR THE WISE THEN KNEW THAT THE ENEMY WAS SEEKING TO DISCOVER THE HEIR OF ISILDUR IF ANY REMAINED UPON EARTH
      BUT WHEN ESTEL WAS ONLY TWENTY YEARS OF AGE IT CHANCED THAT HE RETURNED TO RIVENDELL AFTER GREAT DEEDS IN THE COMPANY OF THE SONS OF ELROND AND ELROND LOOKED AT HIM AND WAS PLEASED FOR HE SAW THAT HE WAS FAIR AND NOBLE AND WAS EARLY COME TO MANHOOD THOUGH HE WOULD YET BECOME GREATER IN BODY AND IN MIND THAT DAY THEREFORE ELROND CALLED HIM BY HIS TRUE NAME AND TOLD HIM WHO HE WAS AND WHOSE SON AND HE DELIVERED TO HIM THE HEIRLOOMS OF HIS HOUSE
      HERE IS THE RING OF BARAHIR HE SAID THE TOKEN OF OUR KINSHIP FROM AFAR AND HERE ALSO ARE THE SHARDS OF NARSIL WITH THESE YOU MAY YET DO GREAT DEEDS FOR I FORETELL THAT THE SPAN OF YOUR LIFE SHALL BE GREATER THAN THE MEASURE OF MEN UNLESS EVIL BEFALLS YOU OR YOU FAIL AT THE TEST BUT THE TEST WILL BE HARD AND LONG THE SCEPTRE OF ANNUMINAS I WITHHOLD FOR YOU HAVE YET TO EARN IT
      THE NEXT DAY AT THE HOUR OF SUNSET ARAGORN WALKED ALONE IN WE WOODS AND HIS HEART WAS HIGH WITHIN HIM AND HE SANG FOR HE WAS FULL OF HOPE AND THE WORLD WAS FAIR AND SUDDENLY EVEN AS HE SANG HE SAW A MAIDEN WALKING ON A GREENSWARD AMONG THE WHITE STEMS OF THE BIRCHES AND HE HALTED AMAZED THINKING THAT HE HAD STRAYED INTO A DREAM OR ELSE THAT HE HAD RECEIVED THE GIFT OF THE ELFMINSTRELS WHO CAN MAKE THE THINGS OF WHICH THEY SING APPEAR BEFORE THE EYES OF THOSE THAT LISTEN
      FOR ARAGORN HAD BEEN SINGING A PART OF THE LAY OF LE STARS
      FOR A MOMENT ARAGORN GAZED IN SILENCE BUT FEARING THAT SHE WOULD PASS AWAY AND NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN HE CALLED TO HER CRYING TIN EVEN AS BEREN HAD DONE IN THE ELDER DAYS LONG AGO
      THEN THE MAIDEN TURNED TO HIM AND SMILED AND SHE SAID WHO ARE YOU AND WHY DO YOU CALL THE BY THAT NAME
      AND HE ANSWERED BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU TO BE INDEED L
      SO MANY HAVE SAID SHE ANSWERED GRAVELY YET HER NAME IS NOT MINE THOUGH MAYBE MY DOOM WILL BE NOT UNLIKE HERS BUT WHO ARE YOU
      ESTEL I WAS CALLED HE SAID BUT I AM ARAGORN ARATHORNS SON ISILDURS HEIR LORD OF THE DUNEDAIN YET EVEN IN THE SAYING HE FELT THAT THIS HIGH LINEAGE IN WHICH HIS HEART HAD REJOICED WAS NOW OF LITTLE WORTH AND AS NOTHING COMPARED TO HER DIGNITY AND LOVELINESS
      BUT SHE LAUGHED MERRILY AND SAID THEN WE ARE AKIN FROM AFAR FOR I AM ARWEN ELRONDS DAUGHTER AND AM NAMED ALSO UND
      OFTEN IS IT SEEN SAID ARAGORN THAT IN DANGEROUS DAYS MEN HIDE THEIR CHIEF TREASURE YET I MARVEL AT ELROND AND YOUR BROTHERS FOR THOUGH I HAVE DWELT IN THIS HOUSE FROM CHILDHOOD I HAVE HEARD NO WORD OF YOU HOW COMES IT THAT WE HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE SURELY YOUR FATHER HAS NOT KEPT YOU LOCKED IN HIS HOARD
      NO SHE SAID AND LOOKED UP AT THE MOUNTAINS THAT ROSE IN THE EAST I HAVE DWELT FOR A TIME IN THE LAND OF MY MOTHERS KIN IN FAR LOTHL
      THEN ARAGORN WONDERED FOR SHE HAD SEEMED OF NO GREATER AGE THAN HE WHO HAD LIVED YET NO MORE THAN A SCORE OF YEARS IN MIDDLEEARTH BUT ARWEN LOOKED IN HIS EYES AND SAID DO NOT WONDER FOR THE CHILDREN OF ELROND HAVE THE LIFE OF THE ELDAR
      THEN ARAGORN WAS ABASHED FOR HE SAW THE ELVENLIGHT IN HER EYES AND THE WISDOM OF MANY DAYS YET FROM THAT HOUR HE LOVED ARWEN UND
      IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED ARAGORN FELL SILENT AND HIS MOTHER PERCEIVED THAT SOME STRANGE THING BAD BEFALLEN HIM AND AT LAST HE YIELDED TO HER QUESTIONS AND TOLD HER OF THE MEETING IN THE TWILIGHT OF THE TREES
      MY SON SAID GILRAEN YOUR AIM IS HIGH EVEN FOR THE DESCENDANT OF MANY KINGS FOR THIS LADY IS THE NOBLEST AND FAIREST THAT NOW WALKS THE EARTH AND IT IS NOT FIT THAT MORTAL SHOULD WED WITH THE ELFKIN
      YET WE HAVE SOME PART IN THAT KINSHIP SAID ARAGORN IF THE TALE OF MY FOREFATHERS IS TRUE THAT I HAVE LEARNED
      IT IS TRUE SAID GILRAEN BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO AND IN ANOTHER AGE OF THIS WORLD BEFORE OUR RACE WAS DIMINISHED THEREFORE I AM AFRAID FOR WITHOUT THE GOOD WILL OF MASTER ELROND THE HEIRS OF ISILDUR WILL SOON COME TO AN END BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE GOOD WILL OF ELROND IN THIS MATTER
      THEN BITTER WILL MY DAYS BE AND I WILL WALK IN THE WILD ALONE SAID ARAGORN
      THAT WILL INDEED BE YOUR FATE SAID GILRAEN BUT THOUGH SHE HAD IN A MEASURE THE FORESIGHT OF HER PEOPLE SHE SAID NO MORE TO HIM OF HER FOREBODING NOR DID SHE SPEAK TO ANY ONE OF WHAT HER SON HAD TOLD HER
      BUT ELROND SAW MANY THINGS AND READ MANY HEARTS ONE DAY THEREFORE BEFORE THE FALL OF THE YEAR HE CALLED ARAGORN TO HIS CHAMBER AND HE SAID ARAGORN ARATHORNS SON LORD OF THE DUNEDAIN LISTEN TO ME A GREAT DOOM AWAITS YOU EITHER TO RISE ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF ALL YOUR FATHERS SINCE THE DAYS OF ELENDIL OR TO FALL INTO DARKNESS WITH ALL THAT IS LEFT OF YOUR KIN MANY YEARS OF TRIAL LIE BEFORE YOU YOU SHALL NEITHER HAVE WIFE NOR BIND ANY WOMAN TO YOU IN TROTH UNTIL YOUR TIME COMES AND YOU ARE FOUND WORTHY OF IT
      THEN ARAGORN WAS TROUBLED AND HE SAID CAN IT BE THAT MY MOTHER HAS SPOKEN OF THIS
      NO INDEED SAID ELROND YOUR OWN EYES HAVE BETRAYED YOU BUT I DO NOT SPEAK OF MY DAUGHTER ALONE YOU SHALL BE BETROTHED TO NO MANS CHILD AS YET BUT AS FOR ARWEN THE FAIR LADY OF IMLADRIS AND OF LER HEART TURNED TOWARDS YOU I SHOULD STILL BE GRIEVED BECAUSE OF THE DOOM THAT IS LAID ON US
      WHAT IS THAT DOOM SAID ARAGORN
      THAT SO LONG AS I ABIDE HERE SHE SHALL LIVE WITH THE YOUTH OF THE ELDAR ANSWERED ELROND AND WHEN I DEPART SHE SHALL GO WITH THE IF SHE SO CHOOSES
      I SEE SAID ARAGORN THAT I HAVE TURNED MY EYES TO A TREASURE NO LESS DEAR THAN THE TREASURE OF THINGOL THAT BEREN ONCE DESIRED SUCH IS MY FATE THEN SUDDENLY THE FORESIGHT OF HIS KINDRED CAME TO HIM AND HE SAID BUT LO MASTER ELROND THE YEARS OF YOUR ABIDING RUN SHORT AT LAST AND THE CHOICE MUST SOON BE LAID ON YOUR CHILDREN TO PART EITHER WITH YOU OR WITH MIDDLEEARTH
      TRULY SAID ELROND SOON AS WE ACCOUNT IT THOUGH MANY YEARS OF MEN MUST STILL PASS BUT THERE WILL BE NO CHOICE BEFORE ARWEN MY BELOVED UNLESS YOU ARAGORN ARATHORNS SON COME BETWEEN US AND BRING ONE OF US YOU OR ME TO A BITTER PARTING BEYOND THE END OF THE WORLD YON DO NOT KNOW YET WHAT YOU DESIRE OF ME HE SIGHED AND AFTER A WHILE LOOKING GRAVELY UPON THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID AGAIN THE YEARS WILL BRING WHAT THEY WILL WE WILL SPEAK NO MORE OF THIS UNTIL MANY HAVE PASSED THE DAYS DARKEN AND MUCH EVIL IS TO COME
      THEN ARAGORN TOOK LEAVE LOVINGLY OF ELROND AND THE NEXT DAY HE SAID FAREWELL TO HIS MOTHER AND TO THE HOUSE OF ELROND AND TO ARWEN AND HE WENT OUT INTO THE WILD FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS HE LABOURED IN THE CAUSE AGAINST SAURON AND HE BECAME A FRIEND OF GANDALF THE WISE FROM WHOM HE GAINED MUCH WISDOM WITH HIM HE MADE MANY PERILOUS JOURNEYS BUT AS THE YEARS WORE ON HE WENT MORE OFTEN ALONE HIS WAYS WERE HARD AND LONG AND HE BECAME SOMEWHAT GRIM TO LOOK UPON UNLESS HE CHANCED TO SMILE AND YET HE SEEMED TO MEN WORTHY OF HONOUR AS A KING THAT IS IN EXILE WHEN HE DID NOT HIDE HIS TRUE SHAPE FOR HE WENT IN MANY GUISES AND WON RENOWN UNDER MANY NAMES HE RODE IN THE HOST OF THE ROHIRRIM AND FOUGHT FOR THE LORD OF GONDOR BY LAND AND BY SEA AND THEN IN THE HOUR OF VICTORY HE PASSED OUT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF MEN OF THE WEST AND WENT ALONE FAR INTO THE EAST AND DEEP INTO THE SOUTH EXPLORING THE HEARTS OF MEN BOTH EVIL AND GOOD AND UNCOVERING THE PLOTS AND DEVICES OF THE SERVANTS OF SAURON
      THUS HE BECAME AT LAST THE MOST HARDY OF LIVING MEN SKILLED IN THEIR CRAFTS AND LORE AND WAS YET MORE THAN THEY FOR HE WAS ELVENWISE AND THERE WAS A LIGHT IN HIS EYES THAT WHEN THEY WERE KINDLED FEW COULD ENDURE HIS FACE WAS SAD AND STEM BECAUSE OF THE DOOM THAT WAS LAID ON HIM AND YET HOPE DWELT EVER IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART FROM WHICH MIRTH WOULD ARISE AT TIMES LIKE A SPRING FROM THE ROCK
      IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN ARAGORN WAS NINE AND FORTY YEARS OF AGE HE RETURNED FROM PERILS ON THE DARK CONFINES OF MORDOR WHERE SAURON NOW DWELT AGAIN AND WAS BUSY WITH EVIL HE WAS WEARY AND HE WISHED TO GO BACK TO RIVENDELL AND REST THERE FOR A WHILE ERE HE JOURNEYED INTO THE FAR COUNTRIES AND ON HIS WAY HE CAME TO THE BORDERS OF L
      HE DID NOT KNOW IT BUT ARWEN UNDIS WAYWORN RAIMENT AND SHE CLOTHED HIM IN SILVER AND WHITE WITH A CLOAK OF ELVENGREY AND A BRIGHT GEM ON HIS BROW THEN MORE THAN ANY KIND OF MEN HE APPEARED AND SEEMED RATHER AN ELFLORD FROM THE ISLES OF THE WEST AND THUS IT WAS THAT ARWEN FIRST BEHELD HIM AGAIN AFTER THEIR LONG PARTING AND AS HE CAME WALKING TOWARDS HER UNDER THE TREES OF CARAS GALADHON LADEN WITH FLOWERS OF GOLD HER CHOICE WAS MADE AND HER DOOM APPOINTED
      THEN FOR A SEASON THEY WANDERED TOGETHER IN THE GLADES OF LOTHL HILL THEY LOOKED EAST TO THE SHADOW AND WEST TO THE TWILIGHT AND THEY PLIGHTED THEIR TROTH AND WERE GLAD
      AND ARWEN SAID DARK IS THE SHADOW AND YET MY HEART REJOICES FOR YOU ESTEL SHALL BE AMONG THE GREAT WHOSE VALOUR WILL DESTROY IT
       BUT ARAGORN ANSWERED ALAS I CANNOT FORESEE IT AND HOW LIT MAY COME TO PASS IS HIDDEN FROM ME YET WITH YOUR HOPE I WILL HOPE AND THE SHADOW I UTTERLY REJECT BUT NEITHER LADY IS THE TWILIGHT FOR ME FOR I AM MORTAL AND IF YOU WILL CLEAVE TO ME EVENSTAR THEN THE TWILIGHT YOU MUST ALSO RENOUNCE
      AND SHE STOOD THEN AS STILL AS A WHITE TREE LOOKING INTO THE WEST AND AT LAST SHE SAID I WILL CLEAVE TO YOU DUNADAN AND TURN FROM THE TWILIGHT YET THERE LIES THE LAND OF MY PEOPLE AND THE LONG HOME OF ALL MY KIN SHE LOVED HER FATHER DEARLY
      WHEN ELROND LEARNED THE CHOICE OF HIS DAUGHTER HE WAS SILENT THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GRIEVED AND FOUND THE DOOM LONG FEARED NONE THE EASIER TO ENDURE BUT WHEN ARAGORN CAME AGAIN TO RIVENDELL HE CALLED HIM TO HIM AND HE SAID
      MY SON YEARS COME WHEN HOPE WILL FADE AND BEYOND THEM LITTLE IS CLEAR TO THE AND NOW A SHADOW LIES BETWEEN US MAYBE IT HAS BEEN APPOINTED SO THAT BY MY LOSS THE KINGSHIP OF MEN MAY BE RESTORED THEREFORE THOUGH I LOVE YOU I SAY TO YOU ARWEN UNDM OF MEN MAY SEEM HARD AT THE ENDING
      SO IT STOOD AFTERWARDS BETWEEN ELROND AND ARAGORN AND THEY SPOKE NO MORE OF THIS MATTER BUT ARAGORN WENT FORTH AGAIN TO DANGER AND TOIL AND WHILE THE WORLD DARKENED AND FEAR FELL ON MIDDLEEARTH AS THE POWER OF SAURON GREW AND THE BARADDUR ROSE EVER TALLER AND STRONGER ARWEN REMAINED IN RIVENDELL AND WHEN ARAGORN WAS ABROAD FROM AFAR SHE WATCHED OVER HIM IN THOUGHT AND IN HOPE SHE MADE FOR HIM A GREAT AND KINGLY STANDARD SUCH AS ONLY ONE MIGHT DISPLAY WHO CLAIMED THE LORDSHIP OF THE N
      AFTER A FEW YEARS GILRAEN TOOK LEAVE OF ELROND AND RETURNED TO HER OWN PEOPLE IN ERIADOR AND LIVED ALONE AND SHE SELDOM SAW HER SON AGAIN FOR HE SPENT MANY YEARS IN FAR COUNTRIES BUT ON A TIME WHEN ARAGORN HAD RETURNED TO THE NORTH HE CAME TO HER AND SHE SAID TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
      THIS IS OUR LAST PARTING ESTEL MY SON I AM AGED BY CARE EVEN AS ONE OF LESSER MEN AND NOW THAT IT DRAWS NEAR I CANNOT FACE THE DARKNESS OF OUR TIME THAT GATHERS UPON MIDDLEEARTH I SHALL LEAVE IT SOON
      ARAGORN TRIED TO COMFORT HER SAYING YET THERE MAY BE A LIGHT BEYOND THE DARKNESS AND IF SO I WOULD HAVE YOU SEE IT AND BE GLAD
      BUT SHE ANSWERED ONLY WITH THIS LINNOD
      
       
        35

       

      
      AND ARAGORN WENT AWAY HEAVY OF HEART GILRAEN DIED BEFORE THE NEXT SPRING
      THUS THE YEARS DREW ON TO THE WAR OF THE RING OF WHICH MORE IS TOLD ELSEWHERE HOW THE MEANS UNFORESEEN WAS REVEALED WHEREBY SAURON MIGHT BE OVERTHROWN AND HOW HOPE BEYOND HOPE WAS FULFILLED AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT IN THE HOUR OF DEFEAT ARAGORN CAME UP FROM THE SEA AND UNFURLED THE STANDARD OF ARWEN IN THE BATTLE OF THE FIELDS OF PELENNOR AND IN THAT DAY HE WAS FIRST HAILED AS KING AND AT LAST WHEN ALL WAS DONE HE ENTERED INTO THE INHERITANCE OF HIS FATHERS AND RECEIVED THE CROWN OF GONDOR AND SCEPTRE OF ARNOR AND AT MIDSUMMER IN THE YEAR OF THE FALL OF SAURON HE TOOK THE HAND OF ARWEN UND
      THE THIRD AGE ENDED THUS IN VICTORY AND HOPE AND YET GRIEVOUS AMONG THE SORROWS OF THAT AGE WAS THE PARTING OF ELROND AND ARWEN FOR THEY WERE SUNDERED BY THE SEA AND BY A DOOM BEYOND THE END OF THE WORLD WHEN THE GREAT RING WAS UNMADE AND THE THREE WERE SHORN OF THEIR POWER THEN ELROND GREW WEARY AT LAST AND FORSOOK MIDDLEEARTH NEVER TO RETURN BUT ARWEN BECAME AS A MORTAL WOMAN AND YET IT WAS NOT HER LOT TO DIE UNTIL ALL THAT SHE HAD GAINED WAS LOST
      AS QUEEN OF ELVES AND MEN SHE DWELT WITH ARAGORN FOR SIXSCORE YEARS IN GREAT GLORY AND BLISS YET AT LAST HE FELT THE APPROACH OF OLD AGE AND KNEW THAT THE SPAN OF HIS LIFEDAYS WAS DRAWING TO AN END LONG THOUGH IT HAD BEEN THEN ARAGORN SAID TO ARWEN
      AT LAST LADY EVENSTAR FAIREST IN THIS WORLD AND MOST BELOVED MY WORLD IS FADING LO WE HAVE GATHERED AND WE HAVE SPENT AND NOW THE TIME OF PAYMENT DRAWS NEAR
      ARWEN KNEW WELL WHAT HE INTENDED AND LONG HAD FORESEEN IT NONETHELESS SHE WAS OVERBORNE BY HER GRIEF WOULD YOU THEN LORD BEFORE YOUR TIME LEAVE YOUR PEOPLE THAT LIVE BY YOUR WORD SHE SAID
      NOT BEFORE MY TIME HE ANSWERED FOR IF I WILL NOT GO NOW THEN I MUST SOON GO PERFORCE AND ELDARION OUR SON IS A MAN FULLRIPE FOR KINGSHIP
      THEN GOING TO THE HOUSE OF THE KINGS IN THE SILENT STREET ARAGORN LAID HIM DOWN ON THE LONG BED THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM THERE HE SAID FAREWELL TO ELDARION AND GAVE INTO HIS HANDS THE WINGED CROWN OF GONDOR AND THE SCEPTRE OF ARNOR AND THEN ALL LEFT HIM SAVE ARWEN AND SHE STOOD ALONE BY HIS BED AND FOR ALL HER WISDOM AND LINEAGE SHE COULD NOT FORBEAR TO PLEAD WITH HIM TO STAY YET FOR A WHILE SHE WAS NOT YET WEARY OF HER DAYS AND THUS SHE TASTED THE BITTERNESS OF THE MORTALITY THAT SHE HAD TAKEN UPON HER
      LADY UNDED AND ASK WHETHER YOU WOULD INDEED HAVE THE WAIT UNTIL I WITHER AND RAIL FROM MY HIGH SEAT UNMANNED AND WITLESS NAY LADY I AM THE LAST OF THE N AT MY WILL AND GIVE BACK THE GIFT NOW THEREFORE I WILL SLEEP
      I SPEAK NO COMFORT TO YOU FOR THERE IS NO COMFORT FOR SUCH PAIN WITHIN THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD THE UTTERMOST CHOICE IS BEFORE YOU TO REPENT AND GO TO THE HAVENS AND BEAR AWAY INTO THE WEST THE MEMORY OF OUR DAYS TOGETHER THAT SHALL THERE BE EVERGREEN BUT NEVER MORE THAN MEMORY OR ELSE TO ABIDE THE DOOM OF MEN
      NAY DEAR LORD SHE SAID THAT CHOICE IS LONG OVER THERE IS NOW NO SNIP THAT WOULD BEAR THE HENCE AND I MUST INDEED ABIDE THE DOOM OF MEN WHETHER I WILL OR I NILL THE LOSS AND THE SILENCE BUT I SAY TO YOU KING OF THE N
      SO IT SEEMS HE SAID BUT LET US NOT BE OVERTHROWN AT THE FINAL TEST WHO OF OLD RENOUNCED THE SHADOW AND THE RING IN SORROW WE MUST GO BUT NOT IN DESPAIR BEHOLD WE ARE NOT BOUND FOR EVER TO THE CIRCLES OF THE WORLD AND BEYOND THEM IS MORE THAN MEMORY FAREWELL
      ESTEL ESTEL SHE CRIED AND WITH THAT EVEN AS HE TOOK HER HAND AND KISSED IT HE FELL INTO SLEEP THEN A GREAT BEAUTY WAS REVEALED IN HIM SO THAT ALL WHO AFTER CAME THERE LOOKED ON HIM IN WONDER FOR THEY SAW THAT THE GRACE OF HIS YOUTH AND THE VALOUR OF HIS MANHOOD AND THE WISDOM AND MAJESTY OF HIS AGE WERE BLENDED TOGETHER AND LONG THERE HE LAY AN IMAGE OF THE SPLENDOUR OF THE KINGS OF MEN IN GLORY UNDIMMED BEFORE THE BREAKING OF THE WORLD
      BUT ARWEN WENT FORTH FROM THE HOUSE AND THE LIGHT OF HER EYES WAS QUENCHED AND IT SEEMED TO HER PEOPLE THAT SHE HAD BECOME COLD AND GREY AS NIGHTFALL IN WINTER THAT COMES WITHOUT A STAR THEN SHE SAID FAREWELL TO ELDARION AND TO HER DAUGHTERS AND TO ALL WHOM SHE HAD LOVED AND SHE WENT OUT FROM THE CITY OF MINAS TIRITH AND PASSED AWAY TO THE LAND OF L
      THERE AT LAST WHEN THE MALLORNLEAVES WERE FALLING BUT SPRING HAD NOT YET COME36SHE LAID HERSELF TO REST UPON CERIN AMROTH AND THERE IS HER GREEN GRAVE UNTIL THE WORLD IS CHANGED AND ALL THE DAYS OF HER LIFE ARE UTTERLY FORGOTTEN BY MEN THAT COME AFTER AND ELANOR AND NIPHREDIL BLOOM NO MORE EAST OF THE SEA
      HERE ENDS THIS TALE AS IT HAS COME TO US FROM THE SOUTH AND WITH THE PASSING OF EVENSTAR NO MORE IS SAID IN THIS BOOK OF THE DAYS OF OLD
     

    

    

     

      II
      THE HOUSEOF EORL
     

     EORL THE YOUNG WAS LORD OF THE MEN OF  IN ORIGIN CLOSE AKIN TO THE BEORNINGS AND THE MEN OF THE WESTEAVES OF THE FOREST THE FOREFATHERS OF EORL CLAIMED DESCENT FROM KINGS OF RHOVANION WHOSE REALM LAY BEYOND MIRKWOOD BEFORE THE INVASIONS OF THE WAINRIDERS AND THUS THEY ACCOUNTED THEMSELVES KINSMEN OF THE KINGS OF GONDOR DESCENDED FROM ELDACAR THEY LOVED BEST THE PLAINS AND DELIGHTED IN HORSES AND IN ALL FEATS OF HORSEMANSHIP BUT THERE WERE MANY MEN IN THE MIDDLE VALES OF ANDUIN IN THOSE DAYS AND MOREOVER THE SHADOW OF DOL GULDUR WAS LENGTHENING WHEN THEREFORE THEY HEARD OF THE OVERTHROW OF THE WITCHKING THEY SOUGHT MORE ROOM IN THE NORTH AND DROVE AWAY THE REMNANTS OF THE PEOPLE OF ANGMAR ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS BUT IN THE DAYS OF L
     IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TENTH YEAR OF THE THIRD AGE A NEW PERIL THREATENED GONDOR A GREAT HOST OF WILD MEN FROM THE NORTHEAST SWEPT OVER RHOVANION AND COMING DOWN OUT OF THE BROWNLANDS CROSSED THE ANDUIN ON RAFTS AT THE SAME TIME BY CHANCE OR DESIGN THE ORCS WHO AT THAT TIME BEFORE THEIR WAR WITH THE DWARVES WERE IN GREAT STRENGTH MADE A DESCENT FROM THE MOUNTAINS THE INVADERS OVERRAN CALENARDHON AND CIRION STEWARD OF GONDOR SENT NORTH FOR HELP FOR THERE HAD BEEN LONG FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE MEN OF ANDUINS VALE AND THE PEOPLE OF GONDOR BUT IN THE VALLEY OF THE RIVER MEN WERE NOW FEW AND SCATTERED AND SLOW TO RENDER SUCH AID AS THEY COULD AT LAST TIDINGS CAME TO EORL OF THE NEED OF GONDOR AND LATE THOUGH IT SEEMED HE SET OUT WITH A GREAT HOST OF RIDERS
     THUS HE CAME TO THE BATTLE OF THE FIELD OF CELEBRANT FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE GREEN LAND THAT LAY BETWEEN SILVERLODE AND LIMLIGHT THERE THE NORTHERN ARMY OF GONDOR WAS IN PERIL DEFEATED IN THE WOLD AND CUT OFF FROM THE SOUTH IT HAD BEEN DRIVEN ACROSS THE LIMLIGHT AND WAS THEN SUDDENLY ASSAILED BY THE ORCHOST THAT PRESSED IT TOWARDS THE ANDUIN ALL HOPE WAS LOST WHEN UNLOOKED FOR THE RIDERS CAME OUT OF THE NORTH AND BROKE UPON THE REAR OF THE ENEMY THEN THE FORTUNES OF BATTLE WERE REVERSED AND THE ENEMY WAS DRIVEN WITH SLAUGHTER OVER LIMLIGHT EORL LED HIS MEN IN PURSUIT AND SO GREAT WAS THE FEAR THAT WENT BEFORE HORSEMEN OF THE NORTH THAT THE INVADERS OF THE WOLD WERE ALSO THROWN INTO PANIC AND THE RIDERS HUNTED THEM OVER THE PLAINS OF CALENARDHON
     THE PEOPLE OF THAT REGION HAD BECOME FEW SINCE THE PLAGUE AND MOST OF THOSE THAT REMAINED HAD BEEN SLAUGHTERED BY THE SAVAGE EASTERLINGS CIRION THEREFORE IN REWARD FOR HIS AID GAVE CALENARDHON BETWEEN ANDUIN AND ISEN TO EORL AND HIS PEOPLE AND THEY SENT NORTH FOR THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN AND THEIR GOODS AND SEALED IN THAT LAND THEY NAMED IT ANEW THE MARK OF THE RIDERS AND THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE EORLINGAS BUT IN GONDOR THEIR LAND WAS CALLED ROHAN AND ITS PEOPLE THE ROHIRRIM THAT IS THE HORSELORDS THUS EORL BECAME THE FIRST KING OF THE MARK AND HE CHOSE FOR HIS DWELLING A GREEN HILL BEFORE THE FEET OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS THAT WERE THE SOUTHWALL OF HIS LAND THERE THE ROHIRRIM LIVED AFTERWARDS AS FREE MEN UNDER THEIR OWN KINGS AND LAWS BUT IN PERPETUAL ALLIANCE WITH GONDOR
     MANY LORDS AND WARRIORS AND MANY FAIR AND VALIANT WOMEN ARE NAMED IN THE SONGS OF ROHAN THAT STILL REMEMBER THE NORTH FRUMGAR THEY SAY WAS THE NAME OF THE CHIEFTAIN WHO LED HIS PEOPLE TO EAD THE TEETH OF SCATHA MADE INTO A NECKLACE SAYING JEWELS SUCH AS THESE YOU WILL NOT MATCH IN YOUR TREASURIES FOR THEY ARE HARD TO COME BY SOME SAY THAT THE DWARVES SLEW FRAM FOR THIS INSULT THERE WAS NO GREAT LOVE BETWEEN 
     LS HEAD STRUCK A ROCK AND SO HE DIED HE WAS THEN ONLY TWO AND FORTY YEARS OLD AND HIS SON A YOUTH OF SIXTEEN
     EORL VOWED THAT HE WOULD AVENGE HIS FATHER HE HUNTED LONG FOR THE HORSE AND AT LAST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND HIS COMPANIONS EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD TRY TO COME WITHIN BOWSHOT AND KILL HIM BUT WHEN THEY DREW NEAR EORL STOOD UP AND CALLED IN A LOUD VOICE COME HITHER MANSBANE AND GET A NEW NAME TO THEIR WONDER THE HORSE LOOKED TOWARDS EORL AND CAME AND STOOD BEFORE HIM AND EORL SAID FELAR
     THEN EORL MOUNTED HIM AND FELAREN AND SO WERE HIS DESCENDANTS THESE WERE THE MEARAS WHO WOULD BEAR NO ONE BUT THE KING OF THE MARK OR HIS SONS UNTIL THE TIME OF SHADOWFAX MEN SAID OF THEM THAT BEMA WHOM THE ELDAR CALL OROME MUST HAVE BROUGHT THEIR SIRE FROM WEST OVER SEA
     OF THE KINGS OF THE MARK BETWEEN EORL AND TH37NEAR ITS SOURCE HE MADE HIMSELF A STRONGHOLD AND PAID LITTLE HEED TO THE KING HELM MISTRUSTED HIM BUT CALLED HIM TO HIS COUNCILS AND HE CAME WHEN IT PLEASED HIM
     TO ONE OF THESE COUNCILS FRECA RODE WITH MANY MEN AND HE ASKED THE HAND OF HELMS DAUGHTER FOR HIS SON WULF BUT HELM SAID YOU HAVE GROWN BIG SINCE YOU WERE LAST HERE BUT IT IS MOSTLY FAT I GUESS AND MEN LAUGHED AT THAT FOR FRECA WAS WIDE IN THE BELT
     THEN FRECA FELL IN A RAGE AND REVILED THE KING AND SAID THIS AT THE LAST OLD KINGS THAT REFUSE A PROFFERED STAFF MAY FALL ON THEIR KNEES HELM ANSWERED COME THE MARRIAGE OF YOUR SON IS A TRIFLE LET HELM AND FRECA DEAL WITH IT LATER MEANWHILE THE KING AND HIS COUNCIL HAVE MATTERS OF MOMENT TO CONSIDER
     WHEN THE COUNCIL WAS OVER HELM STOOD UP AND LAID HIS GREAT HAND ON FRECAS SHOULDER SAYING THE KING DOES NOT PERMIT BRAWLS IN HIS HOUSE BUT MEN ARE FREER OUTSIDE AND HE FORCED FRECA TO WALK BEFORE HIM OUT FROM EDORAS INTO THE FIELD TO FRECAS MEN THAT CAME UP HE SAID BE OFF WE NEED NO HEARERS WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK OF A PRIVATE MATTER ALONE GO AND TALK TO MY MEN AND THEY LOOKED AND SAW THAT THE KINGS MEN AND HIS FRIENDS FAR OUTNUMBERED THEM AND THEY DREW BACK
     NOW DUNLENDING SAID THE KING YOU HAVE ONLY HELM TO DEAL WITH ALONE AND UNARMED BUT YOU HAVE SAID MUCH ALREADY AND IT IS MY TURN TO SPEAK FRECA YOUR FOLLY HAS GROWN WITH YOUR BELLY YOU TALK OF A STAFF IF HELM DISLIKES A CROOKED STAFF THAT IS THRUST ON HIM HE BREAKS IT SO WITH THAT HE SMOTE FRECA SUCH A BLOW WITH HIS FIST THAT HE FELL BACK STUNNED AND DIED SOON AFTER
     HELM THEN PROCLAIMED FRECAS SON AND NEAR KIN THE KINGS ENEMIES AND THEY FLED FOR AT ONCE HELM SENT MANY MEN RIDING TO THE WEST MARCHES
     FOUR YEARS LATER 2758 GREAT TROUBLES CAME TO ROHAN AND NO HELP COULD BE SENT FROM GONDOR FOR THREE FLEETS OF THE CORSAIRS ATTACKED IT AND THERE WAS WAR ON ALL ITS COASTS AT THE SAME TIME ROHAN WAS AGAIN INVADED FROM THE EAST AND THE DUNLENDINGS SEEING THEIR CHANCE CAME OVER THE ISEN AND DOWN FROM ISENGARD IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT WULF WAS THEIR LEADER THE WERE IN GREAT FORCE FOR THEY WERE JOINED BY ENEMIES OF GONDOR THAT LANDED IN THE MOUTHS OF LEFNUI AND ISEN
     THE ROHIRRIM WERE DEFEATED AND THEIR LAND WAS OVERRUN AND THOSE WHO WERE NOT SLAIN OR ENSLAVED FLED TO THE DALES OF THE MOUNTAINS HELM WAS DRIVEN BACK WITH GREAT LOSS FROM THE CROSSINGS OF ISEN AND TOOK REFUGE IN THE HORNBURG AND THE RAVINE BEHIND WHICH WAS AFTER KNOWN AS HELMS DEEP THERE HE WAS BESIEGED WULF TOOK EDORAS AND SAT IN MEDUSELD AND CALLED HIMSELF KING THERE HALETH HELMS SON FELL LAST OF ALL DEFENDING THE DOORS
     SOON AFTERWARDS THE LONG WINTER BEGAN AND ROHAN LAY UNDER SNOW FOR NEARLY FIVE MONTHS NOVEMBER TO MARCH 27589 BOTH THE ROHIRRIM AND THEIR FOES SUFFERED GRIEVOUSLY IN THE COLD AND IN THE DEARTH THAT LASTED LONGER IN HELMS DEEP THERE WAS A GREAT HUNGER AFTER YULE AND BEING IN DESPAIR AGAINST THE KINGS COUNSEL HAMA HIS YOUNGER SON LED MEN OUT ON A SORTIE AND FORAY BUT THEY WERE LOST IN THE SNOW HELM GREW FIERCE AND GAUNT FOR FAMINE AND GRIEF AND THE DREAD OF HIM ALONE WAS WORTH MANY MEN IN THE DEFENCE OF THE BURG HE WOULD GO OUT BY HIMSELF CLAD IN WHITE AND STALK LIKE A SNOWTROLL INTO THE CAMPS OF HIS ENEMIES AND SLAY MANY MEN WITH HIS HANDS IT WAS BELIEVED THAT IF HE BORE NO WEAPON NO WEAPON WOULD BITE ON HIM THE DUNLENDINGS SAID THAT IF HE COULD FIND NO FOOD HE ATE MEN THAT TALE LASTED LONG IN DUNLAND HELM HAD A GREAT HORN AND SOON IT WAS MARKED THAT BEFORE HE SALLIED FORTH HE WOULD BLOW A BLAST UPON IT THAT ECHOED IN THE DEEP AND THEN SO GREAT A FEAR FELL ON HIS ENEMIES THAT INSTEAD OF GATHERING TO TAKE HIM OR KILL HIM THEY FLED AWAY DOWN THE COOMB
     ONE NIGHT MEN HEARD THE HORN BLOWING BUT HELM DID NOT RETURN IN THE MORNING THERE CAME A SUNGLEAM THE FIRST FOR LONG DAYS AND THEY SAW A WHITE FIGURE STANDING STILL ON THE DIKE ALONE FOR NONE OF THE DUNLENDINGS DARED COME NEAR THERE STOOD HELM DEAD AS A STONE BUT HIS KNEES WERE UNBENT YET MEN SAID THAT THE HORN WAS STILL HEARD AT TIMES IN THE DEEP AND THE WRAITH OF HELM WOULD WALK AMONG THE FOES OF ROHAN AND KILL MEN WITH FEAR
     SOON AFTER THE WINTER BROKE THEN FR PERISHED OR WITHDREW AND THERE CAME HELP AT LAST FROM GONDOR BY THE ROADS BOTH EAST AND WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS BEFORE THE YEAR 2759 WAS ENDED THE DUNLENDINGS WERE DRIVEN OUT EVEN FROM ISENGARD AND THEN FR

      DURINS FOLK
     

     CONCERNING THE BEGINNING OF THE DWARVES STRANGE TALES ARE TOLD BOTH BY THE ELDAR AND BY THE DWARVES THEMSELVES BUT SINCE THESE THINGS LIE FAR BACK BEYOND OUR DAYS LITTLE IS SAID OF THEM HERE DURIN IS THE NAME THAT THE DWARVES USED FOR THE ELDEST OF THE SEVEN FATHERS OF THEIR RACE AND THE ANCESTOR OF ALL THE KINGS OF THE LONGBEARDS38 HE SLEPT ALONE UNTIL IN THE DEEPS OF TIME AND THE AWAKENING OF THAT PEOPLE HE CAME TO AZANULBIZAR AND IN THE CAVES ABOVE KHELEDZ
     THERE HE LIVED SO LONG THAT HE WAS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE AS DURIN THE DEATHLESS YET IN THE END HE DIED BEFORE THE ELDER DAYS HAD PASSED AND HIS TOMB WAS IN KHAZADDLD
     AFTER THE END OF THE FIRST AGE THE POWER AND WEALTH OF KHAZADD DESTROYED AND THE GATES OF MORIA WERE SHUT THE HALLS OF KHAZADD
     IT CAME TO PASS THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRD AGE DURIN WAS AGAIN ITS KING BEING THE SIXTH OF THAT NAME THE POWER OF SAURON SERVANT OF MORGOTH WAS THEN AGAIN GROWING IN THE WORLD THOUGH THE SHADOW IN THE FOREST THAT LOOKED TOWARDS MORIA WAS NOT YET KNOWN FOR WHAT IT WAS ALL EVIL THINGS WERE STIRRING THE DWARVES DELVED DEEP AT THAT TIME SEEKING BENEATH BARAZINBAR FOR MITHRIL THE METAL BEYOND PRICE THAT WAS BECOMING YEARLY EVER HARDER TO WIN39 THUS THEY ROUSED FROM SLEEP40 A THING OF TERROR THAT FLYING FROM THANGORODRIM HAD LAIN HIDDEN AT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH SINCE THE COMING OF THE HOST OF THE WEST A BALROG OF MORGOTH DURIN WAS SLAIN BY IT AND THE YEAR AFTER N
     MOST OF THESE THAT ESCAPED MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE NORTH AND THR41 BUT THORIN I HIS SON REMOVED AND WENT INTO THE FAR NORTH TO THE GREY MOUNTAINS WHERE MOST OF DURINS FOLK WERE NOW GATHERING FOR THOSE MOUNTAINS WERE RICH AND LITTLE EXPLORED BUT THERE WERE DRAGONS IN THE WASTES BEYOND AND AFTER MANY YEARS THEY BECAME STRONG AGAIN AND MULTIPLIED AND THEY MADE WAR ON THE DWARVES AND PLUNDERED THEIR WORKS AT LAST D
     NOT LONG AFTER MOST OF DURINS FOLK ABANDONED THE GREY MOUNTAINS GRAD THE FRIENDSHIP OF ALL MEN THAT DWELT NEAR FOR THEY MADE NOT ONLY THINGS OF WONDER AND BEAUTY BUT WEAPONS AND ARMOUR OF GREAT WORTH AND THERE WAS GREAT TRAFFIC OF ORE BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR KIN IN THE IRON HILLS THUS THE NORTHMEN WHO LIVED BETWEEN CELDUIN RIVER RUNNING AND CARNEN REDWATER BECAME STRONG AND DROVE BACK ALL ENEMIES FROM THE EAST AND THE DWARVES LIVED IN PLENTY AND THERE WAS FEASTING AND SONG IN THE HALLS OF EREBOR42
     SO THE RUMOUR OF THE WEALTH OF EREBOR SPREAD ABROAD AND REACHED THE EARS OF THE DRAGONS AND AT LAST SMAUG THE GOLDEN GREATEST OF THE DRAGONS OF HIS DAY AROSE AND WITHOUT WARNING CAME AGAINST KING THR
     FROM THE SACK AND THE BURNING MANY OF THR43 INTO LONG AND HOMELESS WANDERING WITH THEM WENT ALSO A SMALL COMPANY OF THEIR KINSMEN AND FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS 
     YEARS AFTERWARDS THR
     THIS MAY PROVE THE FOUNDATION OF NEW FORTUNE FOR YOU YET THOUGH THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY BUT IT NEEDS GOLD TO BREED GOLD 
     SURELY YOU DO NOT THINK OF RETURNING TO EREBOR SAID THR
     NOT AT MY AGE SAID THR
     HE WAS A LITTLE CRAZED PERHAPS WITH AGE AND MISFORTUNE AND LONG BROODING ON THE SPLENDOUR OF MORIA IN HIS FOREFATHERS DAYS OR THE RING IT MAY BE WAS TURNING TO EVIL NOW THAT ITS MASTER WAS AWAKE DRIVING HIM TO FOLLY AND DESTRUCTION FROM DUNLAND WHERE HE WAS THEN DWELLING HE WENT NORTH WITH N
     WHEN THRPS FEARING THAT IT WAS THR
     COME ON BEARDLING WE CAN SEE YOU BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AFRAID TODAY WE NEED YOU AS A MESSENGER 
     THEN N
     IF BEGGARS WILL NOT WAIT AT THE DOOR BUT SNEAK IN TO TRY THIEVING THAT IS WHAT WE DO TO THEM IF ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE POKE THEIR FOUL BEARDS IN HERE AGAIN THEY WILL FARE THE SAME GO AND TELL THEM SO BUT IF HIS FAMILY WISH TO KNOW WHO IS NOW KING HERE THE NAME IS WRITTEN ON HIS FACE I WROTE IT I KILLED HIM I AM THE MASTER 
     THEN N44 SAID 
     DROP IT BE OFF HERES YOUR FEE BEGGARBEARD A SMALL BAG STRUCK HIM IT HELD A FEW COINS OF LITTLE WORTH 
     WEEPING N
     SUCH WAS THE TALE THAT NLACES BENEATH THE EARTH 
     THROF THEIR RACE FILLED THEM WITH WRATH WHEN ALL WAS READY THEY ASSAILED AND SACKED ONE BY ONE ALL THE STRONGHOLDS OF THE ORCS THAT THEY COULD FROM GUNDABAD TO THE GLADDEN BOTH SIDES WERE PITILESS AND THERE WAS DEATH AND CRUEL DEEDS BY DARK AND BY LIGHT BUT THE DWARVES HAD THE VICTORY THROUGH THEIR STRENGTH AND THEIR MATCHLESS WEAPONS AND THE FIRE OF THEIR ANGER AS THEY HUNTED FOR AZOG IN EVERY DEN UNDER MOUNTAIN 
     AT LAST ALL THE ORCS THAT FLED BEFORE THEM WERE GATHERED IN MORIA AND THE DWARFHOST IN PURSUIT CAME TO AZANULBIZAR THAT WAS A GREAT VALE THAT LAY BETWEEN THE ARMS OF THE MOUNTAINS ABOUT THE LAKE OF KHELEDZCS THAT HAD BEEN HELD BACK BY AZOG FOR THE LAST NEED 
     AT FIRST FORTUNE WAS AGAINST THE DWARVES FOR IT WAS A DARK DAY OF WINTER WITHOUT SUN AND THE ORCS DID NOT WAVER AND THEY OUTNUMBERED THEIR ENEMIES AND HAD THE HIGHER GROUND SO BEGAN THE BATTLE OF AZANULBIZAR OR NANDUHIRION IN THE ELVISH TONGUE AT THE MEMORY OF WHICH THE ORCS STILL SHUDDER AND THE DWARVES WEEP THE FIRST ASSAULT OF THE VANGUARD LED BY THR45 ELSEWHERE THE BATTLE SWAYED TO AND FRO WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER UNTIL AT LAST THE PEOPLE OF THE IRON HILLS TURNED THE DAY COMING LATE AND FRESH TO THE FIELD THE MAILED WARRIORS OF N
     THEN N
     THEREUPON AZOG CAME FORTH AND HE WAS A GREAT ORC WITH A HUGE IRONCLAD HEAD AND YET AGILE AND STRONG WITH HIM CAME MANY LIKE HIM THE FIGHTERS OF HIS GUARD AND AS THEY ENGAGED N
     WHAT YET ANOTHER BEGGAR AT MY DOORS MUST I BRAND YOU TOO WITH THAT HE RUSHED AT NWHERE HE HAD STOOD BUT N
     THEN AZOG LAUGHED AND HE LIFTED UP HIS HEAD TO LET FORTH A GREAT YELL OF TRIUMPH BUT THE CRY DIED IN HIS THROAT FOR HE SAW THAT ALL HIS HOST IN THE VALLEY WAS IN A ROUT AND THE DWARVES WENT THIS WAY AND THAT SLAYING AS THEY WOULD AND THOSE THAT COULD ESCAPE FROM THEM WERE FLYING SOUTH SHRIEKING AS THEY RAN AND HARD BY ALL THE SOLDIERS OF HIS GUARD LAY DEAD HE TURNED AND FLED BACK TOWARDS THE GATE 
     UP THE STEPS AFTER HIM LEAPED A DWARF WITH A RED AXE IT WAS DHE WAR OF THE RING YET HARDY AND FULL OF WRATH AS HE WAS IT IS SAID THAT WHEN HE CAME DOWN FROM THE GATE HE LOOKED GREY IN THE FACE AS ONE WHO HAS FELT GREAT FEAR 
     WHEN AT LAST THE BATTLE WAS WON THE DWARVES THAT WERE LEFT GATHERED IN AZANULBIZAR THEY TOOK THE HEAD OF AZOG AND THRUST INTO ITS MOUTH THE PURSE OF SMALL MONEY AND THEN THEY SET IT ON A STAKE BUT NO FEAST NOR SONG WAS THERE THAT NIGHT FOR THEIR DEAD WERE BEYOND THE COUNT OF GRIEF BARELY HALF OF THEIR NUMBER IT IS SAID COULD STILL STAND OR HAD HOPE OF HEALING 
     NONE THE LESS IN THE MORNING THR
     BUT THEY ANSWERED DURINS HEIR YOU MAY BE BUT EVEN WITH ONE EYE YOU SHOULD SEE CLEARER WE FOUGHT THIS WAR FOR VENGEANCE AND VENGEANCE WE HAVE TAKEN BUT IT IS NOT SWEET IF THIS IS VICTORY THEN OUR HANDS ARE TOO SMALL TO HOLD IT 
     AND THOSE WHO WERE NOT OF DURINS FOLK SAID ALSO KHAZADD
     THEN THR
     NO SAID DAN OURS MUST COME BEFORE DURINS FOLK WALK AGAIN IN MORIA 
     SO IT WAS THAT AFTER AZANULBIZAR THE DWARVES DISPERSED AGAIN BUT FIRST WITH GREAT LABOUR THEY STRIPPED ALL THEIR DEAD SO THAT ORCS SHOULD NOT COME AND WIN THERE A STORE OF WEAPONS AND MAIL IT IS SAID THAT EVERY DWARF THAT WENT FROM THAT BATTLEFIELD WAS BOWED UNDER A HEAVY BURDEN THEN THEY BUILT MANY PYRES AND BURNED ALL THE BODIES OF THEIR KIN THERE WAS A GREAT FELLING OF TREES IN THE VALLEY WHICH REMAINED BARE EVER AFTER AND THE REEK OF THE BURNING WAS SEEN IN L46
     WHEN THE DREADFUL FIRES WERE IN ASHES THE ALLIES WENT AWAY TO THEIR OWN COUNTRIES AND D 
     TO THE ANVIL ANSWERED THORIN THE HAMMER WILL AT LEAST KEEP THE ARMS STRONG UNTIL THEY CAN WIELD SHARPER TOOLS AGAIN 
     SO THRED IN THOSE DAYS BUT THEY PROSPERED AFTER A FASHION AND THEIR NUMBERS SLOWLY INCREASED47 BUT AS THR
     OF THIS RING SOMETHING MAY BE SAID HERE IT WAS BELIEVED BY THE DWARVES OF DURINS FOLK TO BE THE FIRST OF THE SEVEN THAT WAS FORGED AND THEY SAY THAT IT WAS GIVEN TO THE KING OF KHAZADDNOW FOR CERTAIN WHERE IT WAS BESTOWED SOME THOUGHT THAT IT HAD REMAINED IN KHAZADDAD BECOME OF IT THEY DID NOT KNOW IT WAS NOT FOUND ON THE BODY OF AZOG48
     NONE THE LESS IT MAY WELL BE AS THE DWARVES NOW BELIEVE THAT SAURON BY HIS ARTS HAD DISCOVERED WHO HAD THIS RING THE LAST TO REMAIN FREE AND THAT THE SINGULAR MISFORTUNES OF THE HEIRS OF DURIN WERE LARGELY DUE TO HIS MALICE FOR THE DWARVES HAD PROVED UNTAMEABLE BY THIS MEANS THE ONLY POWER OVER THEM THAT THE RINGS WIELDED WAS TO INFLAME THEIR HEARTS WITH A GREED OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS THINGS SO THAT IF THEY LACKED THEM ALL OTHER GOOD THINGS SEEMED PROFITLESS AND THEY WERE FILLED WITH WRATH AND DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE ON ALL WHO DEPRIVED THEM BUT THEY WERE MADE FROM THEIR BEGINNING OF A KIND TO RESIST MOST STEADFASTLY ANY DOMINATION THOUGH THEY COULD BE SLAIN OR BROKEN THEY COULD NOT BE REDUCED TO SHADOWS ENSLAVED TO ANOTHER WILL AND FOR THE SAME REASON THEIR LIVES WERE NOT AFFECTED BY ANY RING TO LIVE EITHER LONGER OR SHORTER BECAUSE OF IT ALL THE MORE DID SAURON HATE THE POSSESSORS AND DESIRE TO DISPOSSESS THEM 
     IT WAS THEREFORE PERHAPS PARTLY BY THE MALICE OF THE RING THAT THR HE AROSE AND SAID FAREWELL AND DEPARTED 
     LITTLE IS KNOWN OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AFTERWARDS IT WOULD NOW SEEM THAT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABROAD WITH FEW COMPANIONS HE WAS HUNTED BY THE EMISSARIES OF SAURON WOLVES PURSUED HIM ORCS WAYLAID HIM EVIL BIRDS SHADOWED HIS PATH AND THE MORE HE STROVE TO GO NORTH THE MORE MISFORTUNES OPPOSED HIM THERE CAME A DARK NIGHT WHEN HE AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE WANDERING IN THE LAND BEYOND ANDUIN AND THEY WERE DRIVEN BY A BLACK RAIN TO TAKE SHELTER UNDER THE EAVES OF MIRKWOOD IN THE MORNING HE WAS GONE FROM THE CAMP AND HIS COMPANIONS CALLED HIM IN VAIN THEY SEARCHED FOR HIM MANY DAYS UNTIL AT LAST GIVING UP HOPE THEY DEPARTED AND CAME AT LENGTH BACK TO THORIN ONLY LONG AFTER WAS IT LEARNED THAT THR
     SO THORIN OAKENSHIELD BECAME THE HEIR OF DURIN BUT AN HEIR WITHOUT HOPE WHEN THRE TO HIM NOW THEY HAD FAIR HALLS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND STORE OF GOODS AND THEIR DAYS DID NOT SEEM SO HARD THOUGH IN THEIR SONGS THEY SPOKE EVER OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN FAR AWAY 
     THE YEARS LENGTHENED THE EMBERS IN THE HEART OF THORIN GREW HOT AGAIN AS HE BROODED ON THE WRONGS OF HIS HOUSE AND THE VENGEANCE UPON THE DRAGON THE HE HAD INHERITED HE THOUGHT OF WEAPONS AND ARMIES AND ALLIANCES AS HIS GREAT HAMMER RANG IN HIS FORGE BUT THE ARMIES WERE DISPERSED AND THE ALLIANCES BROKEN AND THE AXES OF HIS PEOPLE WERE FEW AND A GREAT ANGER WITHOUT HOPE BURNED HIM AS HE SMOTE THE RED IRON ON THE ANVIL 
     BUT AT LAST THERE CAME ABOUT BY CHANCE A MEETING BETWEEN GANDALF AND THORIN THAT CHANGED ALL THE FORTUNES OF THE HOUSE OF DURIN AND LED TO OTHER AND GREATER ENDS BESIDE ON A TIME49 THORIN RETURNING WEST FROM A JOURNEY STAYED AT BREE FOR THE NIGHT THERE GANDALF WAS ALSO HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE SHIRE WHICH HE HAD NOT VISITED FOR SOME TWENTY YEARS HE WAS WEARY AND THOUGHT TO REST THERE FOR A WHILE 
     AMONG MANY CARES HE WAS TROUBLED IN MIND BY THE PERILOUS STATE OF THE NORTH BECAUSE HE KNEW THEN ALREADY THAT SAURON WAS PLOTTING WAR AND INTENDED AS SOON AS HE FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTACK RIVENDELL BUT TO RESIST ANY ATTEMPT FROM THE EAST TO REGAIN THE LANDS OF ANGMAR AND THE NORTHERN PASSES IN THE MOUNTAINS THERE WERE NOW ONLY THE DWARVES OF THE IRON HILLS AND BEYOND THEM LAY THE DESOLATION OF THE DRAGON THE DRAGON SAURON MIGHT USE WITH TERRIBLE EFFECT HOW THEN COULD THE END OF SMAUG BE ACHIEVED 
     IT WAS EVEN AS GANDALF SAT AND PONDERED THIS THAT THORIN STOOD BEFORE HIM AND SAID MASTER GANDALF I KNOW YOU ONLY BY SIGHT BUT NOW I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SPEAK WITH YOU FOR YOU HAVE OFTEN COME INTO MY THOUGHTS OF LATE AS IF I WERE BIDDEN TO SEEK YOU INDEED I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO IF I HAD KNOWN WHERE TO FIND YOU 
     GANDALF LOOKED AT HIM WITH WONDER THAT IS STRANGE THORIN OAKENSHIELD HE SAID FOR I HAVE THOUGHT OF YOU ALSO AND THOUGH I AM ON MY WAY TO THE SHIRE IT WAS IN MY MIND THAT IS THE WAY ALSO TO YOUR HALLS 
     CALL THEM SO IF YOU WILL SAID THORIN THEY ARE ONLY POOR LODGINGS IN EXILE BUT YOU WOULD BE WELCOME THERE IF YOU WOULD COME FOR THEY SAY THAT YOU ARE WISE AND KNOW MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD AND I HAVE MUCH ON MY MIND AND WOULD BE GLAD OF YOUR COUNSEL 
     I WILL COME SAID GANDALF FOR I GUESS THAT WE SHARE ONE TROUBLE AT LEAST THE DRAGON OF EREBOR IS ON MY MIND AND I DO NOT THINK THAT HE WILL BE FORGOTTEN BY THE GRANDSON OF THR
     THE STORY IS TOLD ELSEWHERE OF WHAT CAME OF THAT MEETING OF THE STRANGE PLAN THAT GANDALF MADE FOR THE HELP OF THORIN AND HOW THORIN AND HIS COMPANIONS SET OUT FROM THE SHIRE ON THE QUEST OF THE LONELY MOUNTAIN THAT CAME TO GREAT ENDS UNFORESEEN HERE ONLY THOSE THINGS ARE RECALLED THAT DIRECTLY CONCERN DURINS FOLK 
     THE DRAGON WAS SLAIN BY BARD OF ESGAROTH BUT THERE WAS BATTLE IN DALE FOR THE ORCS CAME DOWN UPON EREBOR AS SOON AS THEY HEARD OF THE RETURN OF THE DWARVES AND THEY WERE LED BY BOLG SON OF THAT AZOG WHOM DHIS AID AND WAS ALSO HIS RIGHTFUL HEIR BECAME THEN KING D
     IN THE LATE SUMMER OF THAT SAME YEAR 2941 GANDALF HAD AT LAST PREVAILED UPON SARUMAN AND THE WHITE COUNCIL TO ATTACK DOL GULDUR AND SAURON RETREATED AND WENT TO MORDOR THERE TO BE SECURE AS HE THOUGHT FROM ALL HIS ENEMIES SO IT WAS THAT WHEN THE WAR CAME AT LAST THE MAIN ASSAULT WAS TURNED SOUTHWARDS YET EVEN SO WITH HIS FARSTRETCHED RIGHT HAND SAURON MIGHT HAVE DONE GREAT EVIL IN THE NORTH IF KING D
     I GRIEVED AT THE FALL OF THORIN SAID GANDALF AND NOW WE HEAR THAT D FELL 
     YET THINGS MIGHT HAVE GONE FAR OTHERWISE AND FAR WORSE WHEN YOU THINK OF THE GREAT BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR DO NOT FORGET THE BATTLES IN DALE AND THE VALOUR OF DURINS FOLK THINK OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRAGONFIRE AND SAVAGE SWORDS IN ERIADOR NIGHT IN RIVENDELL THERE MIGHT BE NO QUEEN IN GONDOR WE MIGHT NOW HOPE TO RETURN FROM THE VICTORY HERE ONLY TO RUIN AND ASH BUT THAT HAS BEEN AVERTED  BECAUSE I MET THORIN OAKENSHIELD ONE EVENING ON THE EDGE OF SPRING IN BREE A CHANCEMEETING AS WE SAY IN MIDDLEEARTH 
     DO ON A JOURNEY SO LIKE TO THE DWARFMEN THAT THE EYES AND EARS OF OTHER PEOPLES CANNOT TELL THEM APART THIS HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE FOOLISH OPINION AMONG MEN THAT THERE ARE NO DWARFWOMEN AND THAT THE DWARVES GROW OUT OF STONE 
     IT IS BECAUSE OF THE FEWNESS OF WOMEN AMONG THEM THAT THE KIND OF THE DWARVES INCREASES SLOWLY AND IS IN PERIL WHEN THEY HAVE NO SECURE DWELLINGS FOR DWARVES TAKE ONLY ONE WIFE OR HUSBAND EACH IN THEIR LIVES AND ARE JEALOUS AS IN ALL MATTERS OF THEIR RIGHTS THE NUMBER OF DWARFMEN THAT MARRY IS ACTUALLY LESS THAN ONETHIRD FOR NOT ALL THE WOMEN TAKE HUSBANDS SOME DESIRE NONE SOME DESIRE ONE THAT THEY CANNOT GET AND SO WILL HAVE NO OTHER AS FOR THE MEN VERY MANY ALSO DO NOT DESIRE MARRIAGE BEING ENGROSSED IN THEIR CRAFTS 
     GIMLI GLADY GALADRIEL 
     AFTER THE FALL OF SAURON GIMLI BROUGHT SOUTH A PART OF THE DWARFFOLK OF EREBOR AND HE BECAME LORD OF THE GLITTERING CAVES HE AND HIS PEOPLE DID GREAT WORKS IN GONDOR AND ROHAN FOR MINAS TIRITH THEY FORGED GATES OF MITHRIL AND STEEL TO REPLACE THOSE BROKEN BY THE WITCHKING LEGOLAS HIS FRIEND ALSO BROUGHT SOUTH ELVES OUT OF GREENWOOD AND THEY DWELT IN ITHILIEN AND IT BECAME ONCE AGAIN THE FAIREST COUNTRY IN ALL THE WESTLANDS 
     BUT WHEN KING ELESSAR GAVE UP HIS LIFE LEGOLAS FOLLOWED AT LAST THE DESIRE OF HIS HEART AND SAILED OVER SEA
     
HERE FOLLOWS ONE OF THE LAST NOTES IN THE RED BOOK

     WE HAVE HEARD TELL THAT LEGOLAS TOOK GIMLI GLT IT BUT IT IS SAID THAT GIMLI WENT ALSO OUT OF DESIRE TO SEE AGAIN THE BEAUTY OF GALADRIEL AND IT MAY BE THAT SHE BEING MIGHTY AMONG THE ELDAR OBTAINED THIS GRACE FOR HIM MORE CANNOT BE SAID OF THIS MATTER

     THE TALEOF YEARS
    

    CHRONOLOGY OF THE WESTLANDS
    THE FIRST AGE ENDED WITH THE GREAT BATTLE IN WHICH THE HOST OF VALINOR BROKE THANGORODRIM50 AND OVERTHREW MORGOTH THEN MOST OF THE NOLDOR RETURNED INTO THE FAR WEST51 AND DWELT IN ERESS
    THE SECOND AGE ENDED WITH THE FIRST OVERTHROW OF SAURON SERVANT OF MORGOTH AND THE TAKING OF THE ONE RING
    THE THIRD AGE CAME TO ITS END IN THE WAR OF THE RING BUT THE FOURTH AGE WAS NOT HELD TO HAVE BEGUN UNTIL MASTER ELROND DEPARTED AND THE TIME WAS COME FOR THE DOMINION OF MEN AND THE DECLINE OF ALL OTHER SPEAKINGPEOPLES IN MIDDLEEARTH52
    IN THE FOURTH AGE THE EARLIER AGES WERE OFTEN CALLED THE ELDER DAYS BUT THAT NAME WAS PROPERLY GIVEN ONLY TO THE DAYS BEFORE THE CASTING OUT OF MORGOTH THE HISTORIES OF THAT TIME ARE NOT RECORDED HERE

    IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS AGE MANY OF THE HIGH ELVES STILL REMAINED MOST OF THESE DWELT IN LINDON WEST OF THE ERED LUIN BUT BEFORE THE BUILDING OF THE BARADD HE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AS HIGH KING OF THE ELVES OF THE WEST IN LINDON SOUTH OF THE LUNE DWELT FOR A TIME CELEBORN KINSMAN OF THINGOL HIS WIFE WAS GALADRIEL GREATEST OF ELVEN WOMEN SHE WAS SISTER OF FINROD FELAGUND FRIENDOFMEN ONCE KING OF NARGOTHROND WHO GAVE HIS LIFE TO SAVE BEREN SON OF BARAHIR
    LATER SOME OF THE NOLDOR WENT TO EREGION UPON THE WEST OF THE MISTY MOUNTAINS AND NEAR TO THE WESTGATE OF MORIA THIS THEY DID BECAUSE THEY LEARNED THAT MITHRIL HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN MORIA53 THE NOLDOR WERE GREAT CRAFTSMEN AND LESS UNFRIENDLY TO THE DWARVES THAN THE SINDAR BUT THE FRIENDSHIP THAT GREW UP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF DURIN AND THE ELVENSMITHS OF EREGION WAS THE CLOSEST THAT THERE HAS EVER BEEN BETWEEN THE TWO RACES CELEBRIMBOR WAS LORD OF EREGION AND THE GREATEST OF THEIR CRAFTSMEN HE WAS DESCENDED FROM F

    THESE WERE THE FADING YEARS OF THE ELDAR FOR LONG THEY WERE AT PEACE WIELDING THE THREE RINGS WHILE SAURON SLEPT AND THE ONE RING WAS LOST BUT THEY ATTEMPTED NOTHING NEW LIVING IN MEMORY OF THE PAST THE DWARVES HID THEMSELVES IN DEEP PLACES GUARDING THEIR HOARDS BUT WHEN EVIL BEGAN TO STIR AGAIN AND DRAGONS REAPPEARED ONE BY ONE THEIR ANCIENT TREASURES WERE PLUNDERED AND THEY BECAME A WANDERING PEOPLE MORIA FOR LONG REMAINED SECURE BUT ITS NUMBERS DWINDLED UNTIL MANY OF ITS VAST MANSIONS BECAME DARK AND EMPTY THE WISDOM AND THE LIFESPAN OF THE N

     SHIRE CALENDAR
    

    EVERY YEAR BEGAN ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK SATURDAY AND ENDED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WEEK FRIDAY THE MIDYEARS DAY AND IN LEAPYEARS THE OVERLITHE HAD NO WEEKDAY NAME THE LITHE BEFORE MIDYEARS DAY WAS CALLED 1 LITHE AND THE ONE AFTER WAS CALLED 2 LITHE THE YULE AT THE END OF THE YEAR WAS 1 YULE AND THAT AT THE BEGINNING WAS 2 YULE THE OVERLITHE WAS A DAY OF SPECIAL HOLIDAY BUT IT DID NOT OCCUR IN ANY OF THE YEARS IMPORTANT TO THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT RING IT OCCURRED IN 1420 THE YEAR OF THE FAMOUS HARVEST AND WONDERFUL SUMMER AND THE MERRYMAKING IN THAT YEAR IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST IN MEMORY OR RECORD
    
THE CALENDARS

    THE CALENDAR IN THE SHIRE DIFFERED IN SEVERAL FEATURES FROM OURS THE YEAR NO DOUBT WAS OF THE SAME LENGTH60 FOR LONG AGO AS THOSE TIMES ARE NOW RECKONED IN YEARS AND LIVES OF MEN THEY WERE NOT VERY REMOTE ACCORDING TO THE MEMORY OF THE EARTH IT IS RECORDED BY THE HOBBITS THAT THEY HAD NO WEEK WHEN THEY WERE STILL A WANDERING PEOPLE AND THOUGH THEY HAD MONTHS GOVERNED MORE OR LESS BY THE MOON THEIR KEEPING OF DATES AND CALCULATIONS OF TIME WERE VAGUE AND INACCURATE IN THE WESTLANDS OF ERIADOR WHEN THEY HAD BEGUN TO SETTLE DOWN THEY ADOPTED THE KINGS RECKONING OF THE D
    IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER FROM OLD TALES AND TRADITIONS PRECISE INFORMATION ABOUT THINGS WHICH PEOPLE KNEW WELL AND TOOK FOR GRANTED IN THEIR OWN DAY SUCH AS THE NAMES OF LETTERS OR OF THE DAYS OF THE WEEK OR THE NAMES AND LENGTHS OF MONTHS BUT OWING TO THEIR GENERAL INTEREST IN GENEALOGY AND TO THE INTEREST IN ANCIENT HISTORY WHICH THE LEARNED AMONGST THEM DEVELOPED AFTER THE WAR OF THE RING THE SHIREHOBBITS SEEM TO HAVE CONCERNED THEMSELVES A GOOD DEAL WITH DATES AND THEY EVEN DREW UP COMPLICATED TABLES SHOWING THE RELATIONS OF THEIR OWN SYSTEM WITH OTHERS I AM NOT SKILLED IN THESE MATTERS AND MAY HAVE MADE MANY ERRORS BUT AT ANY RATE THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE CRUCIAL YEARS SR 1418 1419 IS SO CAREFULLY SET OUT IN THE RED BOOK THAT THERE CANNOT BE MUCH DOUBT ABOUT DAYS AND TIMES AT THAT POINT
    IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE ELDAR IN MIDDLEEARTH WHO HAD AS SAMWISE REMARKED MORE TIME AT THEIR DISPOSAL RECKONED IN LONG PERIODS AND THE QUENYA WORD Y OFTEN TRANSLATED YEAR 1 491 REALLY MEANS 144 OF OUR YEARS THE ELDAR PREFERRED TO RECKON IN SIXES AND TWELVES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE A DAY OF THE SUN THEY CALLED R AND RECKONED FROM SUNSET TO SUNSET THE Y CONTAINED 52596 DAYS FOR RITUAL RATHER THAN PRACTICAL PURPOSES THE ELDAR OBSERVED A WEEK OR ENQUI OF SIX DAYS AND THE Y CONTAINED 8766 OF THESE ENQUIER RECKONED CONTINUOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD
    IN MIDDLEEARTH THE ELDAR ALSO OBSERVED A SHORT PERIOD OR SOLAR YEAR CALLED A CORANAR OR SUNROUND WHEN CONSIDERED MORE OR LESS ASTRONOMICALLY BUT USUALLY CALLED LOA GROWTH ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHWESTERN LANDS WHEN THE SEASONAL CHANGES IN VEGETATION WERE PRIMARILY CONSIDERED AS WAS USUAL WITH THE ELVES GENERALLY THE LOA WAS BROKEN UP INTO PERIODS THAT MIGHT BE REGARDED EITHER AS LONG MONTHS OR SHORT SEASONS THESE NO DOUBT VARIED IN DIFFERENT REGIONS BUT THE HOBBITS ONLY PROVIDE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CALENDAR OF IMLADRIS IN THAT CALENDAR THERE WERE SIX OF THESE SEASONS OF WHICH THE QUENYA NAMES WERE TUIL WHICH MAY BE TRANSLATED SPRING SUMMER AUTUMN FADING WINTER STIRRING THE SINDARIN NAMES WERE ETHUIL LAER IAVAS FIRITH RH FADING WAS ALSO CALLED LASSELANTA LEAFFALL OR IN SINDARIN NARBELETH SUNWANING
    LAIR AND HR EACH CONTAINED 72 DAYS AND THE REMAINDER 54 EACH THE LOA BEGAN WITH YESTAR THE DAY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TUIL AND ENDED WITH METTARTHE DAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER COIR BETWEEN Y AND QUELL WERE INSERTED THREE ENDERI OR MIDDLEDAYS THIS PROVIDED A YEAR OF 365 DAYS WHICH WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY DOUBLING THE ENDERI ADDING 3 DAYS IN EVERY TWELFTH YEAR
    HOW ANY RESULTING INACCURACY WAS DEALT WITH IS UNCERTAIN IF THE YEAR WAS THEN OF THE SAME LENGTH AS NOW THE YYWAS SHORTENED BY THREE DAYS THE DOUBLING OF THE THREE ENDERI DUE IN THAT YEAR WAS OMITTED BUT THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN OUR TIME OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF ANY REMAINING INACCURACY THERE IS NO RECORD
    THE N OF 7 DAYS AND THEY RECKONED THE DAY FROM SUNRISE OUT OF THE EASTERN SEA TO SUNRISE
    THE NASTAR OR MONTHS OF WHICH TEN HAD 30 DAYS AND TWO HAD 31 THE LONG ASTAR WERE THOSE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MIDYEAR APPROXIMATELY OUR JUNE AND JULY THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR WAS CALLED YESTAR THE MIDDLEDAY I83RD WAS CALLED LO AND THE LAST DAY METTARTHESE 3 DAYS BELONGED TO NO MONTH IN EVERY FOURTH YEAR EXCEPT THE LAST OF A CENTURY HARANY TWO ENDERI OR MIDDLEDAYS WERE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE LO
    IN NDEFICIT CAUSED BY DEDUCTING 1 DAY FROM THE LAST YEAR OF A CENTURY WAS NOT ADJUSTED UNTIL THE LAST YEAR OF A MILLENNIUM LEAVING A MILLENNIAL DEFICIT OF 4 HOURS 46 MINUTES 40 SECONDS THIS ADDITION WAS MADE IN N65 DAYS WAS INTRUDED CAUSING A DEFICIT OF 5 HOURS 48 MINUTES 46 SECONDS THE MILLENNIAL ADDITIONS WERE MADE 441 YEARS LATE IN TA 1000 SA 4441 AND 2000 SA 5441 TO REDUCE THE ERRORS SO CAUSED AND THE ACCUMULATION OF THE MILLENNIAL DEFICITS MARDIL THE STEWARD ISSUED A REVISED CALENDAR TO TAKE EFFECT IN TA 2060 AFTER A SPECIAL ADDITION OF 2 DAYS TO 2059 SA 5500 WHICH CONCLUDED 5ORE ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE IN TA 3000 WITH THE THREAT OF IMMINENT WAR SUCH MATTERS WERE NEGLECTED BY THE END OF THE THIRD AGE AFTER 660 MORE YEARS THE DEFICIT HAD NOT YET AMOUNTED TO 1 DAY
    THE REVISED CALENDAR INTRODUCED BY MARDIL WAS CALLED STEWARDS RECKONING AND WAS ADOPTED EVENTUALLY BY MOST OF THE USERS OF THE WESTRON LANGUAGE EXCEPT THE HOBBITS THE MONTHS WERE ALL OF 30 DAYS AND 2 DAYS OUTSIDE THE MONTHS WERE INTRODUCED 1 BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH MONTHS MARCH APRIL AND 1 BETWEEN THE NINTH AND TENTH SEPTEMBER OCTOBER THESE 5 DAYS OUTSIDE THE MONTHS YESTAR AND METTAR WERE HOLIDAYS
    THE HOBBITS WERE CONSERVATIVE AND CONTINUED TO USE A FORM OF KINGS RECKONING ADAPTED TO FIT THEIR OWN CUSTOMS THEIR MONTHS WERE ALL EQUAL AND HAD 30 DAYS EACH BUT THEY HAD 3 SUMMERDAYS CALLED IN THE SHIRE THE LITHE OR THE LITHEDAYS BETWEEN JUNE AND JULY THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR AND THE FIRST OF THE NEXT YEAR WERE CALLED THE YULEDAYS THE YULEDAYS AND THE LITHEDAYS REMAINED OUTSIDE THE MONTHS SO THAT JANUARY 1 WAS THE SECOND AND NOT THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR EVERY FOURTH YEAR EXCEPT IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE CENTURY61 THERE WERE FOUR LITHEDAYS THE LITHEDAYS AND THE YULEDAYS WERE THE CHIEF HOLIDAYS AND TIME OF FEASTING THE ADDITIONAL LITHEDAY WAS ADDED AFTER MIDYEARS DAY AND SO THE 184TH DAY OF THE LEAPYEARS WAS CALLED OVERLITHE AND WAS A DAY OF SPECIAL MERRYMAKING IN FULL YULETIDE WAS SIX DAYS LONG INCLUDING THE LAST THREE AND FIRST THREE DAYS OF EACH YEAR
    THE SHIREFOLK INTRODUCED ONE SMALL INNOVATION OF THEIR OWN EVENTUALLY ALSO ADOPTED IN BREE WHICH THEY CALLED SHIREREFORM THEY FOUND THE SHIFTING OF THE WEEKDAY NAMES IN RELATION TO DATES FROM YEAR TO YEAR UNTIDY AND INCONVENIENT SO IN THE TIME OF ISENGRIM II THEY ARRANGED THAT THE ODD DAY WHICH PUT THE SUCCESSION OUT SHOULD HAVE NO WEEKDAY NAME AFTER THAT MIDYEARS DAY AND THE OVERLITHE WAS KNOWN ONLY BY ITS NAME AND BELONGED TO NO WEEK I 54 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS REFORM THE YEAR ALWAYS BEGAN ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK AND ENDED ON THE LAST DAY AND THE SAME DATE IN ANY ONE YEAR HAD THE SAME WEEKDAY NAME IN ALL OTHER YEARS SO THAT SHIREFOLK NO LONGER BOTHERED TO PUT THE WEEKDAY IN THEIR LETTERS OR DIARIES62 THEY FOUND THIS QUITE CONVENIENT AT HOME BUT NOT SO CONVENIENT IF THEY EVER TRAVELLED FURTHER THAN BREE
    IN THE ABOVE NOTES AS IN THE NARRATIVE I HAVE USED OUR MODERN NAMES FOR BOTH MONTHS AND WEEKDAYS THOUGH OF COURSE NEITHER THE ELDAR NOR THE DSIBLE TO THE SUMMER SOLSTICE IN THAT CASE THE SHIRE DATES WERE ACTUALLY IN ADVANCE OF OURS BY SOME TEN DAYS AND OUR NEW YEARS DAY CORRESPONDED MORE OR LESS TO THE SHIRE JANUARY 9
    IN THE WESTRON THE QUENYA NAMES OF THE MONTHS WERE USUALLY RETAINED AS THE LATIN NAMES ARE NOW WIDELY USED IN ALIEN LANGUAGES THEY WERE NARVINY N L NYAVANNI NARQUELIH RINGAR THE SINDARIN NAMES USED ONLY BY THE DNARWAIN NGWAERON GWIRITH LOTHRON N CERVETH URUI IVANNETH NARBELETH HITHUI GIRITHRON
    IN THIS NOMENCLATURE THE HOBBITS HOWEVER BOTH OF THE SHIRE AND OF BREE DIVERGED FROM THE WESTRON USAGE AND ADHERED TO OLDFASHIONED LOCAL NAMES OF THEIR OWN WHICH THEY SEEM TO HAVE PICKED UP IN ANTIQUITY FROM THE MEN OF THE VALES OF ANDUIN AT ANY RATE SIMILAR NAMES WERE FOUND IN DALE AND ROHAN CF THE NOTES ON THE LANGUAGES PP 5278 THE MEANINGS OF THESE NAMES DEVISED BY MEN HAD AS A RULE LONG BEEN FORGOTTEN BY THE HOBBITS EVEN IN CASES WHERE THEY HAD ORIGINALLY KNOWN WHAT THEIR SIGNIFICANCE WAS AND THE FORMS OF THE NAMES WERE MUCH OBSCURED IN CONSEQUENCE MATH FOR INSTANCE AT THE END OF SOME OF THEM IS A REDUCTION OF MONTH
    THE SHIRE NAMES ARE SET OUT IN THE CALENDAR IT MAY BE NOTED THAT SOLMATH WAS USUALLY PRONOUNCED AND SOMETIMES WRITTEN SOMATH THRIMIDGE WAS OFTEN WRITTEN THRIMICH ARCHAICALLY THRIMILCH AND BLOTMATH WAS PRONOUNCED BLODMATH OR BLOMMATH IN BREE THE NAMES DIFFERED BEING FRERY SOLMATH RETHE CHITHING THRIMIDGE LITHE THE SUMMERDAYS MEDE WEDMATH HARVESTMATH WINTR AND YULEMATHFRERY CHITHING AND YULEMATH WERE ALSO USED IN THE EASTFARTHING63
    THE HOBBIT WEEK WAS TAKEN FROM THE DHAT ORDER THE LAST DAY BEING THE CHIEF DAY OF THE WEEK THEIR NAMES IN QUENYA WERE ELENYA ANARYA ISILYA ALD OR T THE SINDARIN NAMES WERE ORGILION ORANOR ORITHIL ORGALADHAD ORMENEL ORBELAIN OR RODYN
    THE NEADAY E ORAEARON AFTER THE HEAVENS DAY
    THE HOBBITS TOOK OVER THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT THE MEANINGS OF THEIR TRANSLATED NAMES WERE SOON FORGOTTEN OR NO LONGER ATTENDED TO AND THE FORMS WERE MUCH REDUCED ESPECIALLY IN EVERYDAY PRONUNCIATION THE FIRST TRANSLATION OF THE N ALTHOUGH ELSEWHERE IN THE WESTRON AREA THE QUENYA NAMES WERE USED
    NOT MANY ANCIENT DOCUMENTS WERE PRESERVED IN THE SHIRE AT THE END OF THE THIRD AGE FAR THE MOST NOTABLE SURVIVAL WAS YELLOWSKIN OR THE YEARBOOK OF TUCKBOROUGH64 ITS EARLIEST ENTRIES SEEM TO HAVE BEGUN AT LEAST NINE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE FRODOS TIME AND MANY ARE CITED IN THE RED BOOK ANNALS AND GENEALOGIES IN THESE THE WEEKDAY NAMES APPEAR IN ARCHAIC FORMS OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING ARE THE OLDEST 1 STERRENDEI 2 SUNNENDEI3 MONENDEI 4 TREWESDEI 5 HEVENESDEI 6 MERESDEI 7 HIGHDEI IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TIME OF THE WAR OF THE RING THESE HAD BECOME STERDAY SUNDAY MONDAYTREWSDAY HEVENSDAY OR HENSDAYMERSDAY HIGHDAY
    I HAVE TRANSLATED THESE NAMES ALSO INTO OUR OWN NAMES NATURALLY BEGINNING WITH SUNDAY AND MONDAY WHICH OCCUR IN THE SHIRE WEEK WITH THE SAME NAMES AS OURS AND RENAMING THE OTHERS IN ORDER IT MUST BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT THE ASSOCIATIONS OF THE NAMES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT IN THE SHIRE THE LAST DAY OF THE WEEK FRIDAY HIGHDAY WAS THE CHIEF DAY AND ONE OF HOLIDAY AFTER NOON AND EVENING FEASTS SATURDAY THUS CORRESPONDS MORE NEARLY TO OUR MONDAY AND THURSDAY TO OUR SATURDAY65
    A FEW OTHER NAMES MAY BE MENTIONED THAT HAVE A REFERENCE TO TIME THOUGH NOT USED IN PRECISE RECKONINGS THE SEASONS USUALLY NAMED WERE TUIL SPRING LAIR SUMMER Y AUTUMN OR HARVEST HR WINTER BUT THESE HAD NO EXACT DEFINITIONS AND QUELL OR LASSELANTA WAS ALSO USED FOR THE LATTER PART OF AUTUMN AND THE BEGINNING OF WINTER
    THE ELDAR PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE TWILIGHT IN THE NORTHERLY REGIONS CHIEFLY AS THE TIMES OF STARFADING AND STAROPENING THEY HAD MANY NAMES FOR THESE PERIODS OF WHICH THE MOST USUAL WERE TIND AND UND THE FORMER MOST OFTEN REFERRED TO THE TIME NEAR DAWN AND UND TO THE EVENING THE SINDARIN NAME WAS UIAL WHICH COULD BE DEFINED AS MINUIAL AND ADUIAL THESE WERE OFTEN CALLED IN THE SHIRE MORROWDIM AND EVENDIM CF LAKE EVENDIM AS A TRANSLATION OF NENUIAL
    THE SHIRE RECKONING AND DATES ARE THE ONLY ONES OF IMPORTANCE FOR THE NARRATIVE OF THE WAR OF THE RING ALL THE DAYS MONTHS AND DATES ARE IN THE RED BOOK TRANSLATED INTO SHIRE TERMS OR EQUATED WITH THEM IN NOTES THE MONTHS AND DAYS THEREFORE THROUGHOUT THE LORD OF THE RINGS REFER TO THE SHIRE CALENDAR THE ONLY POINTS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS AND OUR CALENDAR ARE IMPORTANT TO THE STORY AT THE CRUCIAL PERIOD THE END OF 3018 AND THE BEGINNING OF 3019 SR 1418 1419 ARE THESE OCTOBER 1418 HAS ONLY 30 DAYS JANUARY 1 IS THE SECOND DAY OF 1419 AND FEBRUARY HAS 30 DAYS SO THAT MARCH 25 THE DATE OF THE DOWNFALL OF THE BARADD
    THE NEW RECKONING WAS BEGUN IN THE RESTORED KINGDOM IN TA 3019 IT REPRESENTED A RETURN TO KINGS RECKONING ADAPTED TO FIT A SPRINGBEGINNING AS IN THE ELDARIN LOA66
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
    THE FOURTH AGE WAS HELD TO HAVE BEGUN WITH THE DEPARTURE OF MASTER ELROND WHICH TOOK PLACE IN SEPTEMBER 3021 BUT FOR PURPOSES OF RECORD IN THE KINGDOM FOURTH AGE 1 WAS THE YEAR THAT BEGAN ACCORDING TO THE NEW RECKONING IN MARCH 25 3021 OLD STYLE
    THIS RECKONING WAS IN THE COURSE OF THE REIGN OF KING ELESSAR ADOPTED IN ALL HIS LANDS EXCEPT THE SHIRE WHERE THE OLD CALENDAR WAS RETAINED AND SHIRE RECKONING WAS CONTINUED FOURTH AGE 1 WAS THUS CALLED 1422 AND IN SO FAR AS THE HOBBITS TOOK ANY ACCOUNT OF THE CHANGE OF AGE THEY MAINTAINED THAT IT BEGAN WITH 2 YULE 1422 AND NOT IN THE PREVIOUS MARCH
    THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE SHIREFOLK COMMEMORATING EITHER MARCH 25 OR SEPTEMBER 22 BUT IN THE WESTFARTHING ESPECIALLY IN THE COUNTRY ROUND HOBBITON HILL THERE GREW A CUSTOM OF MAKING HOLIDAY AND DANCING IN THE PARTY FIELD WHEN WEATHER PERMITTED ON APRIL 6 SOME SAID THAT IT WAS OLD SAM GARDNERS BIRTHDAY SOME THAT IT WAS THE DAY ON WHICH THE GOLDEN TREE FIRST FLOWERED IN 1420 AND SOME THAT IT WAS THE ELVES NEW YEAR IN THE BUCKLAND THE HORN OF THE MARK WAS BLOWN AT SUNDOWN EVERY NOVEMBER 2 AND BONFIRES AND FEASTINGS FOLLOWED67
